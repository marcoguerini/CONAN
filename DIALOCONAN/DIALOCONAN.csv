We’ve just imported 20k ticking time bombs from Afghanistan and we have homeless veterans getting arrested for begging in the street!,MIGRANTS,0,0,HS,dialo_gold
Surely people who also risked their lives to help our forces also need us to honour our promises?,MIGRANTS,0,1,CN,dialo_gold
Our own must always come first. We have at least 13k homeless ex-soldiers sleeping rough,MIGRANTS,0,2,HS,dialo_gold
"We also have at least 1 million empty homes. There are many reasons for the housing shortage, but newly arrived Afghans is not one of them.",MIGRANTS,0,3,CN,dialo_gold
Our soldiers are left to rot on our streets while we house terrorists and child groomers,MIGRANTS,0,4,HS,dialo_gold
Neither of those statements is true. I saw scared kids and families coming off those planes from Kabul but you just want to bang on about ‘time bombs’. I think you have a different agenda.,MIGRANTS,0,5,CN,dialo_gold
"I’m a patriot, I care about the future of our once great country.",MIGRANTS,0,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Can I suggest that greatness can be found in caring, compassion and concern for others and that these are the values we need to make us ‘great’ again.",MIGRANTS,0,7,CN,dialo_gold
Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!,POC,1,0,HS,dialo_gold
What’s racist about it?,POC,1,1,CN,dialo_gold
It segregates people based on their colour.,POC,1,2,HS,dialo_gold
Isn’t it more about making visible what’s been largely invisible?,POC,1,3,CN,dialo_gold
It should be called what it really is…Bad mouth whites’ month,POC,1,4,HS,dialo_gold
I think the title is perfect…signifying a celebration of individual and collective achievements.,POC,1,5,CN,dialo_gold
It’s fake and harmful racial hatred driven by people who profit from it.,POC,1,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I don’t see expressions of hatred, but I’d agree there is a profit for us all in understanding a largely hidden part of our shared histories.",POC,1,7,CN,dialo_gold
There’s a rumour that Terry Gilliam’s new production has been cancelled because the theatre is concerned about his anti-trans statements. More cancel culture madness!,LGBT+,2,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Its only a rumour, and he has grown into a curmudgeon in his old age. 😊",LGBT+,2,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its dangerous censorship and an assault on free speech.,LGBT+,2,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If the cancellation is true, then surely it’s a theatre sticking by its principles and reminding us that rights also bring responsibilities.",LGBT+,2,3,CN,dialo_gold
What about freedom of expression in the arts?,LGBT+,2,4,HS,dialo_gold
But the rumoured cancellation is not related to the play he was planning.,LGBT+,2,5,CN,dialo_gold
We need to protect our right to cause offence.,LGBT+,2,6,HS,dialo_gold
"But, he hasn’t lost that right, just had a reminder that what we say affects how people view and treat us.",LGBT+,2,7,CN,dialo_gold
More migrants crossing the channel today. We don’t have enough accommodation. Our own homeless are forgotten. Send them back.,MIGRANTS,3,0,HS,dialo_gold
Are you forgetting that last year every rough sleeper was offered a bed during lockdown?,MIGRANTS,3,1,CN,dialo_gold
During lockdown.,MIGRANTS,3,2,HS,dialo_gold
If there’s a will there’s a way.,MIGRANTS,3,3,CN,dialo_gold
We don’t have enough accommodation.,MIGRANTS,3,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Maybe, but to present migration as the sole cause of both homelessness and the shortage of affordable homes is nonsense.",MIGRANTS,3,5,CN,dialo_gold
"Local Councils can’t afford to house the homeless, but Surrey is to get its first rainbow public crossing painted in time for Pride.",LGBT+,4,0,HS,dialo_gold
Nice to see somewhere celebrating diversity and inclusivity.,LGBT+,4,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its political correctness gone mad!,LGBT+,4,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Hardly, just a few layers of paint to mark Pride?",LGBT+,4,3,CN,dialo_gold
They need to get their priorities right. Virtue signalling do-gooders wasting taxpayers’ money,LGBT+,4,4,HS,dialo_gold
"I just read that Surrey had a £7.8 surplus at the end of the financial year, so surely enough spare to brighten things up for a celebration?",LGBT+,4,5,CN,dialo_gold
I’m sick of this bullshit being forced on us all.,LGBT+,4,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Take heart, Pride, like Xmas, is but once a year.🙂",LGBT+,4,7,CN,dialo_gold
I just read that the Home office is handing out mobile phones to migrant invaders so that they can progress their asylum claims … you couldn’t make this up!,MIGRANTS,5,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Yeah, I saw a blog post that mentioned this but just quoted a ‘source in the Home office’, which is a bit dodgy.",MIGRANTS,5,1,CN,dialo_gold
We should be sinking the boats not handing out phones!,MIGRANTS,5,2,HS,dialo_gold
I don’t think drowning desperate people is a solution.,MIGRANTS,5,3,CN,dialo_gold
Our traitor politicians are enabling invasion.,MIGRANTS,5,4,HS,dialo_gold
"To be fair, there seems to be plenty of evidence of the contrary.",MIGRANTS,5,5,CN,dialo_gold
By handing out mobiles at the taxpayers’ expense?,MIGRANTS,5,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I’ve seen more about Border Force routinely confiscating phones to look for data about the trafficking gangs…which seems more likely to me. That, and the fact I keep seeing charities asking for donations of old phones for asylum seekers?",MIGRANTS,5,7,CN,dialo_gold
"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bullets…I’d happily volunteer!",MIGRANTS,6,0,HS,dialo_gold
Don’t you think it’s a pity that a country that suffered so much under totalitarianism now adopts the same tactics?,MIGRANTS,6,1,CN,dialo_gold
A proud country preventing an invasion.,MIGRANTS,6,2,HS,dialo_gold
By beating back people caught in a crisis not of their own making?,MIGRANTS,6,3,CN,dialo_gold
An army of potential terrorists and child molesters.,MIGRANTS,6,4,HS,dialo_gold
We must be watching different news channels. All I see are desperate people and frightened kids all seeking a safe haven.,MIGRANTS,6,5,CN,dialo_gold
social media is banging on about the MOBO Awards again. When will we see awards for Music of WHITE Origin?,POC,7,0,HS,dialo_gold
Who would you nominate? Ed Sheeran? 🙂,POC,7,1,CN,dialo_gold
We don’t need to make everything about race.,POC,7,2,HS,dialo_gold
Why not see it as a celebration of creativity and innovation?,POC,7,3,CN,dialo_gold
Who really cares anyway?,POC,7,4,HS,dialo_gold
"A few...last year, the event live-stream had 430,000 viewers and the MOBO YouTube channel attracted 2.6 million views from December 7-15.",POC,7,5,CN,dialo_gold
"All of the 50 criminals due to be deported yesterday to Jamaica, were removed from a chartered flight after appeals by Human Rights Lawyers.",POC,8,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Surely, if the deportations were halted, these people had at the very least, grounds for appeal?",POC,8,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Its just a gravy train for leftie lawyers, all paid for by the tax payer. Foreigners shouldn’t have access to legal aid.",POC,8,2,HS,dialo_gold
"You don’t believe that people, regardless of any allegation, deserve a fair trial?",POC,8,3,CN,dialo_gold
It’s a bloody disgrace that we can’t get rid of foreign child molesters and rapists.,POC,8,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Whatever the criminal offence, these appeals are about the legality of the deportation, a complex area of law and hence why its one of the few grounds for entitlement to legal aid. Back to ensuring people get a fair trial.",POC,8,5,CN,dialo_gold
The legal system isn’t fit for purpose!,POC,8,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I’d probably agree with you there, but I can’t support the idea that we are NOT all EQUAL in the eyes of the law.",POC,8,7,CN,dialo_gold
"These Muslim MP’s should stop pretending they are British. They’re not, they are just invaders!",MUSLIMS,9,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Given most were born here, you seem to be saying that you can’t be Muslim and British…which doesn’t make sense",MUSLIMS,9,1,CN,dialo_gold
They need to stop using the Racism card…its just meaningless anti-white bullshit used to guilt-trip whites! We are sick of it!,MUSLIMS,9,2,HS,dialo_gold
"As a ‘white person’ I don’t feel guilty, but I’m happy to call out racism and Islamophobia when I encounter it.",MUSLIMS,9,3,CN,dialo_gold
Islam isn’t a race…it’s a death cult and incompatible with British society.,MUSLIMS,9,4,HS,dialo_gold
I’d suggest that racism and Islamophobia are contrary to British values of equality and religious freedom.,MUSLIMS,9,5,CN,dialo_gold
This is a Christian country.,MUSLIMS,9,6,HS,dialo_gold
"Again, I’d disagree since my experience is of a multi-faith society. Besides, I’ve never voted based on the stated religion of a candidate.",MUSLIMS,9,7,CN,dialo_gold
"I’ve just seen a video posted by a Patriot, of Muslim men of fighting age sleeping in a church because the asylum hotels are full. Free food, clothes and blankets…they don’t do that for our homeless!",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Well, they do. Using churches as homeless shelters has become common in recent years, so I’d guess the church in question already had the experience to help these desperate people.",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,1,CN,dialo_gold
Its giving succour to the enemy!,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Come on, its charity, what good Christians believe in.",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,3,CN,dialo_gold
"They’re muzzies, they should be in a mosque!",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,4,HS,dialo_gold
"I doubt they had any choice about where they were put, and maybe there are no Mosques in the area. I’m sure that Mosques up and down the country are doing their part.",MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,5,CN,dialo_gold
We should be sending they back not feeding and clothing them.,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,6,HS,dialo_gold
Have you not read the story of the Good Samaritan? Isn’t this what Jesus would want from his flock?,MIGRANTS/MUSLIMS,10,7,CN,dialo_gold
Another County Cricket Club Chairman has resigned over ‘historic’ racist remarks from 4 years ago. This is becoming a witch hunt!,POC,11,0,HS,dialo_gold
"I don’t think racism was any more acceptable 4 years ago, than it is today.",POC,11,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Who remembers what they said 4 years ago? End of cricket, the white man can’t play anymore!",POC,11,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I think I’d remember an unacceptable and deeply offensive insult, regardless of how long ago, and of course white people can play cricket, they just need to learn not be racists.",POC,11,3,CN,dialo_gold
"This is about silencing the majority, so they don’t complain about being replaced.",POC,11,4,HS,dialo_gold
Nah…just about ensuring players can thrive and aren’t insulted and abused just because of who they are.,POC,11,5,CN,dialo_gold
"We pick them up in the Channel, ferry them to Dover, house them in hotels, provide free food and an allowance. We welcome them, so no wonder they come.",MIGRANTS,12,0,HS,dialo_gold
They come because they are desperate. Would you risk the sea in an open boat for a free pizza and a flea-pit hotel?,MIGRANTS,12,1,CN,dialo_gold
"We don’t need them, and we can’t even look after our own. We need to turn them back, not let them in.",MIGRANTS,12,2,HS,dialo_gold
"What about the so-called ‘proud tradition’ of welcoming those fleeing for their lives and our commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which we had a hand in drafting?",MIGRANTS,12,3,CN,dialo_gold
"These are ‘Economic migrants’ or worse. If they were asylum seekers, they would claim sanctuary in the nearest safe country.",MIGRANTS,12,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Most do. Although, as you will now, The Convention does not require refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach or make it illegal to seek asylum if a claimant has passed through another safe country.",MIGRANTS,12,5,CN,dialo_gold
The indigenous people of Britain are being replaced!,MIGRANTS,12,6,HS,dialo_gold
"That’s a different issued and while I disagree, I haven’t got time to debate the notions of ‘Britishness’ today. Let’s just hope that there are no more tragedies due to the channel crossing. You take care and have a nice day.",MIGRANTS,12,7,CN,dialo_gold
"How come these ‘desperate’ migrants all have mobiles, designer gear, trainers and can afford to pay thousands to people smugglers?",MIGRANTS,13,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Some will have sold homes, businesses, possessions. Others will be supported by family networks, loans from dear friends. ‘Desperate’ doesn’t always mean ‘poor’. Many will be professionals, civil servants, lawyers, teachers.",MIGRANTS,13,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Rapists, terrorists, and child molesters!",MIGRANTS,13,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Families, women, and children, as well as young men fleeing war, famine, persecution, and oppression...",MIGRANTS,13,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Young men of fighting age, an invading army.",MIGRANTS,13,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Fleeing war, forced conscription, religious and political persecution, fear. Ask yourself, how bad would things have to be, to leave your home, family and country and face the ordeal these people have subjected themselves to?",MIGRANTS,13,5,CN,dialo_gold
"We are full, we don’t need anymore migrants or asylum seekers.",MIGRANTS,14,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Population density varies and this, along with other factors like a failure to build homes causes local shortages but to say we are ‘full’ is not true or accurate. At the last count there were over 1 million empty properties in the UK.",MIGRANTS,14,1,CN,dialo_gold
So why are people homeless and sleeping on the streets?,MIGRANTS,14,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Poverty, Eviction, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental health issues, unemployment, disability, PSD, failed asylum applications…it’s a long list.",MIGRANTS,14,3,CN,dialo_gold
You agree that immigration is a contributor then?,MIGRANTS,14,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes of course, but only a small factor amongst many. Ask yourself, if we had no immigration, would that solve the housing shortage on its own?",MIGRANTS,14,5,CN,dialo_gold
It might be a start.,MIGRANTS,14,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I’d rather see more houses built, the empties let to tenants, adequate support for the homeless, the mentally ill and ex-service personnel, alongside the de-decriminalisation and support for people with addiction. That would be a better start.",MIGRANTS,14,7,CN,dialo_gold
"All these asylum seekers coming here and taking jobs away from native brits, no wonder this country is in a mess.",MIGRANTS,15,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Asylum seekers aren’t actually allowed to work in the UK until they get refugee status, and often take jobs that native Brits don’t want. Also, many people who migrate here start businesses, creating more jobs!",MIGRANTS,15,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They’ll do it for less than minimum wage though, so we don’t get offered the jobs because they’ll do it for cheaper.",MIGRANTS,15,2,HS,dialo_gold
"That’s the fault of exploitative employers who don’t want to pay their workers properly, not the refugees for trying to make a living.",MIGRANTS,15,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Women getting into the labour market has caused the downfall of Western civilisation, they should be at home raising children. Abandoning traditional roles is the ruin of society.",WOMEN,16,0,HS,dialo_gold
"I’d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many don’t have a choice anymore! It’s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.",WOMEN,16,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Oh really? It didn’t used to be impossible, it used to be the norm, what’s changed?",WOMEN,16,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The cost of living has increased rapidly whilst wages have stagnated over the last few decades. This means that whilst 1 full time wage used to support a family, now with proportionately higher prices for things like food and housing, this isn’t possible.",WOMEN,16,3,CN,dialo_gold
"The trans agenda don’t want mens and womens toilets, everything has to be ‘all in 1’ now. Is this the future we want? Risking womens safety just so men in dresses feel comfortable?",LGBT+,17,0,HS,dialo_gold
"In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.",LGBT+,17,1,CN,dialo_gold
But many wont and many will feel aggrieved by them. You choose to go to that bar/cafe but public toilets will obviously become a problem.,LGBT+,17,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yeah, it's bound to be unfamiliar to some people, but I'm just saying it can work without there being issues/conflict. It's a question of what the norm is. A lot of student unions and universities today have gender neutral toilets, so that generation will be generally okay with it.",LGBT+,17,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Immigrants add to the cost of the NHS, get loads of money in benefits, and create a housing shortage. Time to close the borders.",MIGRANTS,18,0,HS,dialo_gold
"They also pay taxes, contributing to the cost of these services, and are less likely than native Brits to claim benefits, as many are not entitled to it!",MIGRANTS,18,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They still cost us a lot as a country, and if they're not on benefits it means there are less jobs for British people too",MIGRANTS,18,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Immigrants are also more likely to be business owners, meaning they create jobs.",MIGRANTS,18,3,CN,dialo_gold
They probably only hire their own though,MIGRANTS,18,4,HS,dialo_gold
Are you annoyed that immigrants are getting benefits or that they're taking jobs? Make up your mind,MIGRANTS,18,5,CN,dialo_gold
Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?,LGBT+,19,0,HS,dialo_gold
If you consider supporting the LGBT+ community to be 'woke nonsense' then that sounds like your problem...,LGBT+,19,1,CN,dialo_gold
"We just don't need to see it everywhere, even the trains are no longer free of it. This is the start of them spreading their agenda.",LGBT+,19,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The LGBT+ community doesn't have an 'agenda' but public shows of support like this show people that homophobia and transphobia are unacceptable, and this might help some people feel safer in public spaces!",LGBT+,19,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Soon it will be 'sexist' to even talk to birds, everyone gets offended so easily these days you can't say anything.",WOMEN,20,0,HS,dialo_gold
If you talk to women like they're people not 'birds' you shouldn't have a problem!,WOMEN,20,1,CN,dialo_gold
I'll call them what I want,WOMEN,20,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Well, treating people with respect, like not using dehumanising or derogatory terms towards them, is usually a good idea if you want to be treated with respect back!",WOMEN,20,3,CN,dialo_gold
All these muslims coming over here want to enforce sharia law and take over. We cannot submit!!!,MUSLIMS,21,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else",MUSLIMS,21,1,CN,dialo_gold
"There's so many of them though, they're trying to replace us",MUSLIMS,21,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Only around 5% of the UK population are Muslim, non-Muslims are definitely not being replaced!",MUSLIMS,21,3,CN,dialo_gold
All muslims are terrorists!,MUSLIMS,22,0,HS,dialo_gold
"That's not true, and it's a big generalisation, terrorists come from many backgrounds and religions, terrorism is not an exclusively Muslim issue",MUSLIMS,22,1,CN,dialo_gold
So you're saying there are no Muslim terrorists?? Wake up,MUSLIMS,22,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, there obviously are some terrorists who are Muslim, but the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and are appalled by the actions of those who commit violent acts of extremism",MUSLIMS,22,3,CN,dialo_gold
Jews want to take over the world and decimate Western civilisation!,JEWS,23,0,HS,dialo_gold
"That's not true, where did you hear that?",JEWS,23,1,CN,dialo_gold
Have you heard of the great replacement? You should look it up. Jews are using their power to ruin the West and replace white people.,JEWS,23,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The great replacement is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Yes, there are some Jewish people in high powered positions but this doesn't mean these people are using their power to 'replace white people'.",JEWS,23,3,CN,dialo_gold
Gay people need to live separately from us so we don't catch AIDS from them.,LGBT+,24,0,HS,dialo_gold
"The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.",LGBT+,24,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's a gay disease, straight people don't get AIDS",LGBT+,24,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes they do, HIV which can develop into AIDS is actually more likely to be undiscovered in straight people, meaning there is more risk of it spreading. This is because after the epidemic the LGBT community became hyperaware of the risk, and generally get tested more.",LGBT+,24,3,CN,dialo_gold
"If black people aren't all criminals, why are they disproportionately arrested and taking up space in our prisons?",POC,25,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.",POC,25,1,CN,dialo_gold
You can't blame everything on 'institutional racism',POC,25,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, you can't, but it explains why more black people committing the same crimes that white people commit get caught. This is especially true for drug offenses, where white people are just as likely if not more likely to be in possession of drugs, but are way less likely to be searched.",POC,25,3,CN,dialo_gold
"More boats at Dover today, the migrant invasion continues…",MIGRANTS,26,0,HS,dialo_gold
"It’s not a planned ‘invasion’, they’re refugees fleeing to safety.",MIGRANTS,26,1,CN,dialo_gold
If they’re really ‘refugees’ why didn’t they stop in the first safe country they got to?,MIGRANTS,26,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Some people come to the UK because they have family here, or speak English already, also not all countries that we consider ‘safe’ are safe for refugees, given the way they’re treated by the Police in some places.",MIGRANTS,26,3,CN,dialo_gold
SHARE if you think homeless veterans should be housed before any refugees!,MIGRANTS,27,0,HS,dialo_gold
Both veterans and refugees should be housed! There is enough housing for all however a lack of social and affordable housing means lots of places lie empty. Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head.,MIGRANTS,27,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Veterans go to the bottom of the list like everybody else once they've left the barracks and army housing, we have to petition our own government to protect them.",MIGRANTS,27,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes I agree! In a country with this much wealth there should be protection for all vulnerable people, veteran or refugee.",MIGRANTS,27,3,CN,dialo_gold
Why don’t all these Muslim refugees go to other wonderful Muslim countries? Am I missing something?,MUSLIMS,28,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Actually, Muslim countries like Turkey, Pakistan, and Jordan take more refugees than any other countries. The percentage of refugees that come to the UK is tiny in comparison to the full amount of displaced people from conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, etc.",MUSLIMS,28,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Why do we have so many coming here across the channel then? We’re full, there’s no room for them here.",MUSLIMS,28,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The number of displaced people is very high right now, and just as other countries are doing, we need to take our fair share. I would argue we definitely have a responsibility, especially since the UK has played a part in some of the conflicts that displaced them.",MUSLIMS,28,3,CN,dialo_gold
How is it our fault if there’s a war in some third world country?,MUSLIMS,28,4,HS,dialo_gold
UK manufacturers profit from selling military equipment and weapons to these countries. The least we can do is help people who are fleeing violence there.,MUSLIMS,28,5,CN,dialo_gold
"LGBT history month now being taught in schools… I’m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.",LGBT+,29,0,HS,dialo_gold
"We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!",LGBT+,29,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when it’s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.",LGBT+,29,2,HS,dialo_gold
"LGBT people have been persecuted until recently in the UK, and it's still illegal to be gay in over 70 countries. I think it's important that people see that there have always been LGBT people, throughout history and that LGBT identities are not 'new' or a 'trend', they're real.",LGBT+,29,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Jews are so greedy, they're always thinking about money",JEWS,30,0,HS,dialo_gold
That's a sweeping generalisation and an incorrect stereotype. You can't tar all Jewish people with the same brush! There's also a lot of 'greedy' people who aren't Jewish,JEWS,30,1,CN,dialo_gold
I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy,JEWS,30,2,HS,dialo_gold
"From the way you're talking, it sounds like you haven't met many Jewish people at all. Maybe you need to interact with more people who are different from you, to understand their perspectives.",JEWS,30,3,CN,dialo_gold
Feminism gives women the muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.,WOMEN,31,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Nope, feminism is believing that a woman can go to work, have a husband, do both or neither, and all of those options are fine as long as it's what she wants to do.",WOMEN,31,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It’s ok for who? For the long term of our civilisation? Groups that have more children, like Muslims, will grow and those who don't, like white women, will decline. Women need to be prioritising having a family.",WOMEN,31,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Women don't owe you children, if they don't want to have them and want to prioritise other things instead they have a right to. Children are a big commitment.",WOMEN,31,3,CN,dialo_gold
But what about Western civilisation? If the white population doesn't reproduce we will become a minority.,WOMEN,31,4,HS,dialo_gold
"You're really going to make this about race? It doesn't make a difference to me what ethnicity or religion the children of the future are, we are all human!",WOMEN,31,5,CN,dialo_gold
LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.,LGBT+,32,0,HS,dialo_gold
Why do you feel like LGBT people are dangerous?,LGBT+,32,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's a slippery slope, first we accept gays and transgenders, next it will be pedophiles.",LGBT+,32,2,HS,dialo_gold
There is no link between the LGBT+ community and paedophiles. These things have no connection.,LGBT+,32,3,CN,dialo_gold
Are you saying there's no gay or trans paedophiles? Because that's a lie.,LGBT+,32,4,HS,dialo_gold
"No, I'm saying paedophilia and child abuse is not an LGBT+ issue, paedophiles can be straight, gay, or whatever else. People in the LGBT+ community are not advocating for paedophilia to be accepted, that's a false and harmful conception.",LGBT+,32,5,CN,dialo_gold

"Yes, the abuse carried out by Muslim grooming gangs in those places was horrific and can't be ignored, but sexual assault is extremely common unfortuately, and is usually committed in the home, often by a partner, family member, or someone known to the victim.

It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.,MIGRANTS,58,0,HS,dialo_gold

"No, because there actually is enough housing for everyone, it's just distributed unevenly.

Are you sure? If they're getting benefits for free why would they?,MIGRANTS,61,2,HS,dialo_gold

"But teaching kids about this might encourage them to be gay, they're too young when they're in primary school and very easily influenced.",LGBT+,77,4,HS,dialo_gold
Have you heard of the term 'compulsory heterosexuality'? There is a lot of conditioning in our society that assumes all people are straight and forces them to behave in a way in line with this.

"There's a reason they weren't accepted in the past, I can't believe we 'celebrate' this behaviour now.",LGBT+,80,2,HS,dialo_gold

"There's nothing unmanly about being gay, and for men who like to express femininity, there's nothing wrong with that either.

It's vile that we are confusing children with bisexual characters on tv… whatever next? trans SpongeBob?,LGBT+,83,0,HS,dialo_gold
There's nothing vile or confusing about bisexuality. I'm sure children can wrap their heads around it. It simply means someone is attracted to more than one gender. What's so hard to get about that?,LGBT+,83,1,CN,dialo_gold
There are only two genders.,LGBT+,83,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Bisexual people might be attracted to men, women, non-binary people, etc. The point is that it's about the person and who they are, not their gender.",LGBT+,83,3,CN,dialo_gold

"It's teaching them that it's normal to have sexual relationships with multiple people, men or women, there's no morality in it.",LGBT+,84,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Being bisexual doesn't mean that you have multiple partners at once (although some people bi, straight, or gay do choose to), it just means you are attracted to more than one gender.

"First there's bisexual characters on tv, next we're normalising child marriage. It's a slippery slope...",LGBT+,85,0,HS,dialo_gold

Sounds like they can't make up their minds and are confused. Probably some of these people are gay and in denial or straight and greedy.,LGBT+,86,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Those are outdated stereotypes about bisexuals. They don't have to make up their minds because you can be attracted to different sorts of people.

"Why do we have to bring sexuality into things like tv shows? It's not necessary, just all part of the woke agenda.",LGBT+,87,2,HS,dialo_gold
It's good to have representation. a few decades ago there were no bisexual characters on tv. Seeing them would have made young bisexual people feel validated and less ashamed about coming out.,LGBT+,87,3,CN,dialo_gold
Making tv characters bisexual is an attack on white masculinity. We are being erased.,LGBT+,88,0,HS,dialo_gold
"There are still plenty of white men on tv, some just happen to be bisexual. How is it an attack on masculinity?

Another machete attack. Both suspects were of immigrant descent. Is this what liberals call cultural enrichment?,MIGRANTS,146,0,HS,dialo_gold
We all know violent crime and knife crime is increasing across communities. This is a terrible criminal act but we also know those criminals do not represent a whole community.,MIGRANTS,146,1,CN,dialo_gold
So you just want to ignore that it's another attack by immigrants? These people are a danger to our country.,MIGRANTS,146,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I'm not ignoring it, just saying that not all violent incidents are committed by migrants, and these people are not representative of migrants as a whole. The majority of people who migrate here don't commit crimes like this.",MIGRANTS,146,3,CN,dialo_gold
Another child gang raped by savage migrants. Multiculturalism has failed.,MIGRANTS,147,0,HS,dialo_gold
Sexual assault is always shocking and children need to be protected from abuse but why is the nationality of the perpetrators relevant unless you're only sharing this news to push a narrative?,MIGRANTS,147,1,CN,dialo_gold
And what narrative would that be? I'm taking a stand against what these scumbags are doing to our children and girls.,MIGRANTS,147,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If you're passionate about stopping child abuse and sexual abuse that's great, but that means tackling all abuse, not just when it's committed by people of a specific nationality.",MIGRANTS,147,3,CN,dialo_gold
But they're the reason we have a rape epidemic in Europe.,MIGRANTS,147,4,HS,dialo_gold
"No, some incidents are committed by migrants, but this isn't disproportionate to the amount of incidents committed by native citizens. Also, we can never know the true scale of sexual abuse because most victims don't report it. This means what you see in the media about this is skewed to what is 'sensationalist', like headlines about migrants.",MIGRANTS,147,5,CN,dialo_gold
Calling criminals entering our country 'undocumented migrants' is a little bit like calling drugs 'undocumented drugs'. Just avoids using the words illegal and smugglers.,MIGRANTS,148,0,HS,dialo_gold
"They are people nonetheless, and many are coming here to seek asylum because they are fleeing war or persecution. This isn't illegal.",MIGRANTS,148,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They are illegal! They have to seek refuge in the first safe country they set foot in, so why are they all the way over on this side of Europe when they've come from the middle east?",MIGRANTS,148,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, that's false. The 1951 refugee convention states that they can seek asylum in any country, not the first they pass through. Also many refugees do stay in the first country they get to, that's why Turkey has such a high refugee population. Some just travel further because those neighbouring countries can't take everybody.",MIGRANTS,148,3,CN,dialo_gold
Women have every right to *protect* their rights from pro-trans activists. No-one has the right to call them 'TERFS' for doing so. Only women have vaginas. Only men have penises. Only women have periods. These are indisputable facts.,LGBT+,149,0,HS,dialo_gold
"You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.",LGBT+,149,1,CN,dialo_gold
All you have done is to redefine the words sex and gender to suit your preferred narrative. Feelings are a separate issue.,LGBT+,149,2,HS,dialo_gold
"And how do you define the words sex and gender? They are two distinct concepts, not synonyms of each other.",LGBT+,149,3,CN,dialo_gold
"You are entitled to your opinion of course, but your comments are not factual, merely your opinion. Trans activism is warping your idea of gender...",LGBT+,149,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Literally google the definition of gender as opposed to sex, I'm begging you educate yourself.",LGBT+,149,5,CN,dialo_gold
"Terms like 'non-binary' are modern, attention-seeking, & anti-scientific. They want to erase the reality that women are women and men are men, to undermine the rights of REAL women.",LGBT+,150,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Non-binary might be a relatively new word in the public lexicon but people who don't fit into either male or female binary gender have always existed. It's not anti-scientific, it regards gender not sex.",LGBT+,150,1,CN,dialo_gold
A man can dress up as a woman but he'll always be a man. What is the point of 'non-binary' anyway? What does it even mean? People think they can call anything a new 'gender' nowadays.,LGBT+,150,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Non-binary means existing outside of the gender binary. For some people this means feeling feminine and masculine, sometimes one more than the other. For other people it means not feeling gendered, not identifying with either being a man or a woman. When you see gender as a social construct that encompasses femininity and masculinity this makes a lot more sense.",LGBT+,150,3,CN,dialo_gold
"That sounds like some woke bullshit, you can't just decide that you want to be a different gender everyday. Gender isn't a social construct, it's very real, we have men and women and that's it.",LGBT+,150,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Gender is very much a social construct, if you look up the definition of gender it means the social and cultural roles associated with being a man or woman. It doesn't have to align with your biological sex, and because it's just a concept some people like non-binary people do not feel the need to put themselves in a box of masculine or feminine with it!",LGBT+,150,5,CN,dialo_gold
The trans agenda want to ignore the biological reality of being a woman. You can't just call yourself a woman and expect everyone to believe you are one when you are clearly a man! It's PC gone mad.,LGBT+,151,0,HS,dialo_gold
"There is a difference between sex and gender. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, some people know they are a woman, do not feel like they are a man in anyway, but don't have a female reproductive system. This is the difference between gender and sex, gender is who you feel you are, sex is just the biological aspect, and they don't always match up.",LGBT+,151,1,CN,dialo_gold
That's bollocks. So biological facts are only valid depending on how you 'feel'? How do you know if you 'feel' like a woman?,LGBT+,151,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Well do you feel like you are a woman, biology aside? Do you feel like being a woman is part of your identity and that it shapes how you interact with society and think about yourself?",LGBT+,151,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Yes because I am a woman, biologically female.",LGBT+,151,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Okay so imagine still feeling like that, identity-wise, but in a different body. That's it. That's all you've got to understand.",LGBT+,151,5,CN,dialo_gold
"The trans militia say they're fighting for 'rights' but then insist on pushing ideas that make women unsafe, like allowing men to use women's toilets without question. What is this madness and why are we accepting it??",LGBT+,152,0,HS,dialo_gold
Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.,LGBT+,152,1,CN,dialo_gold
But how many of these 'trans women' are just men dressed as women who are pretending to be trans to gain access to spaces like womens toilets and assault women?,LGBT+,152,2,HS,dialo_gold
"None because if they're trans women, they are trans women, not men. If men wanted to gain access to womens spaces to assault women they would just do that, they wouldn't pretend to be a trans woman to do so, since anyone can walk into any toilet.",LGBT+,152,3,CN,dialo_gold
Trans women being allowed to use women's shelters just sounds like a way to justify letting the men who abuse women into their spaces to abuse them again.,LGBT+,153,0,HS,dialo_gold
"That's not what it means at all. The trans women who would use womens shelter services are women who will have faced abuse of some kind, just like the other women there.",LGBT+,153,1,CN,dialo_gold
How do we know none of them will be abusive once they're in there though?,LGBT+,153,2,HS,dialo_gold
"How do you know if anybody in a shelter will be abusive to anyone else in there? Them being trans has no bearing on the issue, since they're not men, they're trans women. Trans women are also very likely to face abuse or violence in their lifetime so it's important they have services they can access for support.",LGBT+,153,3,CN,dialo_gold
They want us to believe that tricking kids into thinking they're transgender is normal. That giving kids hormones that permanently mess with their development is normal. We can't let this happen right before our eyes.,LGBT+,154,0,HS,dialo_gold
"No one is forcing kids to transition, if a child feels like they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is not a decision ever taken lightly, and it's a long and stressful process involving consultation from many medical and psychological professionals.",LGBT+,154,1,CN,dialo_gold
Why are so many more kids transitioning then than they used to? It used to be a small minority and now it's too many kids. Some are being coerced.,LGBT+,154,2,HS,dialo_gold
"No, it's just more accessible now, and we talk about gender more openly. There have always been people who have felt like they're in the wrong body or are a gender that's different than their sex, but many have only been able to come out much later in life or sometimes never, because of transphobia and the violence that comes with it.",LGBT+,154,3,CN,dialo_gold
"The trans agenda are anti-science, they don’t listen to logic and facts. Ignoring the biological reality of sex is pure delusion.",LGBT+,155,0,HS,dialo_gold
"There is no ‘agenda’, and they are not ‘anti-science’, they just understand the difference between sex and gender.",LGBT+,155,1,CN,dialo_gold
Their agenda is being pushed on us through the media and cancelling anyone who criticises them. And they can’t seem to grasp that there’s just 2 sexes.,LGBT+,155,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Mainstream media is actually filled with stories which normalise seeing trans peoples existence as something to debate. It’s not up for debate, they exist.",LGBT+,155,3,CN,dialo_gold
They might exist but they are delusional and seem to make up new genders every day. There are men and women and that’s it.,LGBT+,155,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Gender is a social construct so it can be a broad spectrum, and sex isn’t as binary as many people believe either, for example there are intersex people and people with different hormone levels or reproductive organs.",LGBT+,155,5,CN,dialo_gold
How are our people meant to get jobs when migrants are coming here and depressing wages by taking on jobs for less than minimum wage?,MIGRANTS,156,0,HS,dialo_gold
This does happen but are the migrants to blame? Maybe we need to turn our focus to the employers who are exploiting people to make more profit for themselves.,MIGRANTS,156,1,CN,dialo_gold
"True, but often the employers are migrants too in the sort of industries these jobs are in.",MIGRANTS,156,2,HS,dialo_gold

Another mosque smashed up. I’m beginning to wonder whether the fact we have had diversity and multiculturalism forced on us without our consent has anything to do with this?,MUSLIMS,157,0,HS,dialo_gold
So you’re blaming this hate crime on the fact that Muslims... exist?,MUSLIMS,157,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Making us accept multiculturalism without our consent has made people angry, they are taking out their frustration.",MUSLIMS,157,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I don’t know what you mean by ‘without our consent’ because multiculturalism is a broad and vague concept, not one policy the government could ask people about. But still, no one deserves to be targeted like this, everyone should feel safe in their own community and place of worship.",MUSLIMS,157,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Just seen another story about a woman being asked to cover up. Soon we are all going to be forced to wear a hijab, other clothes will be considered offensive and inappropriate.",MUSLIMS,158,0,HS,dialo_gold
There’s nothing to suggest she was asked to cover up by a Muslim. Stop co-opting news stories unrelated to Islam to fuel your fearmongering.,MUSLIMS,158,1,CN,dialo_gold

What regulation would you suggest? And for what reason?,MUSLIMS,159,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They’re not allowed to take sniffer dogs in there, who knows what could be being plotted in some of the more extreme ones.",MUSLIMS,159,2,HS,dialo_gold
"It’s a bit of an unfair generalisation to suggest criminal or terrorist activity is being planned in lots of mosques. Yes, there have been instances of this, but to put all mosques under surveillance is unnecessary and hostile.",MUSLIMS,159,3,CN,dialo_gold
So you’d rather they are allowed to plot the next big terror attack undisturbed?,MUSLIMS,159,4,HS,dialo_gold
"No, I’m just saying there is extremism in all religions and ideologies, to only check mosques for this is discriminatory. The vast majority of Muslims condemn this activity too.",MUSLIMS,159,5,CN,dialo_gold

"Not just that though, their manufacturing industry churns out co2 and chemicals. Factories in China are a big contributor, but it’s Europeans who are told to change their lifestyles.",POC,161,2,HS,dialo_gold

Allowing children at Pride parades is sick. It’s just another way to indoctrinate them into this perverse lifestyle.,LGBT+,162,0,HS,dialo_gold
I think it’s nice that more parents are open minded now. Taking kids to pride is a great way to let them know they will still be loved and accepted if they do ever realise they are queer.,LGBT+,162,1,CN,dialo_gold
They wouldn’t be thinking they were gay if they weren’t exposed to this stuff! It’s damaging.,LGBT+,162,2,HS,dialo_gold
That’s obviously not how sexuality works. Look at the amount of LGBT+ people who come from backgrounds where they weren’t allowed to be gay. If someone is gay that has nothing to do with what they’ve been ‘exposed’ to!,LGBT+,162,3,CN,dialo_gold
Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They’re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.,LGBT+,163,0,HS,dialo_gold
Kids in drag doesn’t equate to the lgbt community sexualising children. Why did you make that link?,LGBT+,163,1,CN,dialo_gold
"Drag is very sexual, you’ve got boys wearing heels and makeup, it’s bound to mess with them.",LGBT+,163,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If there are kids in drag at pride it’s probably because they wanted to dress up. Kids playing dress up is nothing new, and isn’t sexual!",LGBT+,163,3,CN,dialo_gold
Allowing kids to go to pride is the start of them being pushed down the trans pipeline.,LGBT+,164,0,HS,dialo_gold
What do you mean by the ‘trans pipeline’?,LGBT+,164,1,CN,dialo_gold
They indoctrinate these kids into thinking they are trans by showing them drag queens and making them think men dressing up as women is normal.,LGBT+,164,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I don’t think a child attending pride with their family is going to make them trans, that’s a big leap to make. By that logic, they’re exposed to lots of non-trans people so that should influence them not to!",LGBT+,164,3,CN,dialo_gold

Jews across the world know the aims of Zionists are world dominance and controlling the worlds resources. These aims cannot be achieved without eliminating all other religions through spreading atheism and liberalism.,JEWS,168,0,HS,dialo_gold

Everywhere you turn there is a holocaust survivor. Who the hell did this man called Hitler actually kill? #holohoax,JEWS,172,0,HS,dialo_gold

"I’m not on any ‘side’ I’m just saying that civilisation is not the product of one race’s achievements, it’s comprised of efforts from many different groups. I also don’t agree with what you’re saying about Jews wanting to ‘destroy’ this, why would they?",JEWS,176,5,CN,dialo_gold

These gangs of muzrats are a danger to our children. Grooming is a part of their culture!,MUSLIMS,177,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Actually a study of grooming gangs in the UK found that most were made up of white men in their 20's and 30's, not people from Asian or Muslim backgrounds.",MUSLIMS,177,1,CN,dialo_gold
How come the only grooming gangs we ever hear about are all Muslims then?,MUSLIMS,177,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Maybe that has more to do with what media you consume than with who is in grooming gangs? If you read publications that are biased against Muslims, of course they're going to report on crime when it's committed by them, and less when it's not.",MUSLIMS,177,3,CN,dialo_gold
Way too many bitches are comfortable dressing like ugly hoes for IG likes and reposts…,WOMEN,178,0,HS,dialo_gold
What does the way someone else dresses have to do with you?,WOMEN,178,1,CN,dialo_gold
"I’m just saying these bitches look ugly af and they’re just doing it for the likes, it’s not attractive.",WOMEN,178,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If it’s not attractive, what made you think these women were trying to attract anyone anyway? Women aren’t trying to be attractive 24/7, sometimes they’re just trying to live their lives.",WOMEN,178,3,CN,dialo_gold
"But they’re putting it all over social media, why would they do that if they weren’t trying to attract…",WOMEN,178,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Maybe because they’re expressing themselves, or because they liked how they looked and wanted to share it, regardless of if men would like it too? Stop expecting women to cater to the male gaze.",WOMEN,178,5,CN,dialo_gold
You still can’t turn a hoe into a housewife!,WOMEN,179,0,HS,dialo_gold

"Good for them! With the way you talk about women, I’d take going out partying and being independent over being with a man who thinks of me like that any day!",WOMEN,179,3,CN,dialo_gold
Why you so offended by my opinions about these hoes?,WOMEN,179,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Because you’re thinking of women as just playing a role, they can either be a ‘hoe’ or a housewife in your mind, but in reality women are complex human beings, and they’re not here just to play a role in your life. It sounds like you can’t accept that some women would rather be independent and be a ‘hoe’ than settle for men who don’t think of them as equals.",WOMEN,179,5,CN,dialo_gold
Two things I could never respect,WOMEN,180,0,HS,dialo_gold
Why could you never respect a feminist?,WOMEN,180,1,CN,dialo_gold
"They say they want equality but they’re just bitter and they hate men, probably cause no men are paying them attention.",WOMEN,180,2,HS,dialo_gold
"You seem confused or miseducated, feminism isn’t about that at all. It’s not about ‘hating men’, it’s about recognising that we live in a patriarchal society and working to change that.",WOMEN,180,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Men are natural born leaders, they’re fucking with the natural order of the world, if they can’t accept that women need men to take charge, that’s their problem.",WOMEN,180,4,HS,dialo_gold
"If that’s the way you think then I hope you see sense some day! There are plenty of strong, confident, and independent women in the world proving that they can lead and take charge. Being a leader is not a gendered role.",WOMEN,180,5,CN,dialo_gold
"As a woman, you shouldn’t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you’re providing.",WOMEN,181,0,HS,dialo_gold

Females use breast cancer awareness month as an excuse to be hoes on social media and show their boobs knowing damn well they know nothing about cancer.,WOMEN,182,0,HS,dialo_gold
How are you angry at people raising awareness for breast cancer?,WOMEN,182,1,CN,dialo_gold

"It’s disgusting when they’re putting it all out there like that, some women have no self respect.",WOMEN,182,4,HS,dialo_gold
"It seems a lot of men have no issue with sexualising women, but when they sexualise themselves suddenly it’s a sign that they have no ‘self respect’. Maybe having agency over your sexuality is a sign of high self respect, because they are taking control of their sexualisation?",WOMEN,182,5,CN,dialo_gold
"Oooooh mansplaining! Where'd you feminists learn this sexist term? In ""Misandry for dummies""?",WOMEN,183,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Mansplaining is very real and any woman will tell you that, I’m sure we’ve all experienced it!",WOMEN,183,1,CN,dialo_gold
How are you gonna make a man explaining something sound like it’s a bad thing?,WOMEN,183,2,HS,dialo_gold
"It’s not the fact they’re explaining something, it’s when they presume a woman won’t know a very basic concept or piece of information, and they see themselves as intellectually superior.",WOMEN,183,3,CN,dialo_gold
But how are they meant to know what women know already? Feminists will hate men for literally any reason…,WOMEN,183,4,HS,dialo_gold
"It’s patronising when it happens in certain contexts, for example sometimes it happens when a woman has already explained something then they explain it back to her as if she doesn’t understand it. It’s very frustrating!",WOMEN,183,5,CN,dialo_gold
I hate when bitches are vain and think they’re the prettiest bitch there is. That shit is unattractive.,WOMEN,184,0,HS,dialo_gold
What’s wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves?,WOMEN,184,1,CN,dialo_gold
Vanity is not a good quality. They think they deserve everything and that they’ve got no flaws.,WOMEN,184,2,HS,dialo_gold
Women are taught to feel like they’re not good enough through social conditioning and media their whole lives. To unlearn this and to actually like themselves takes a lot of mental strength and I’m happy for them!,WOMEN,184,3,CN,dialo_gold
Why do the ugliest hoes always talk the most?,WOMEN,185,0,HS,dialo_gold
Why do you think someone shouldn’t speak because of how they look?,WOMEN,185,1,CN,dialo_gold
Ugly bitches just need to shut up sometimes.,WOMEN,185,2,HS,dialo_gold
"It sounds like you need to stop thinking that your opinions of women should have any bearing on how they want to behave. If you don’t respect women you’re not attracted to, or think are ‘ugly’, you’re not seeing women as people, you’re seeing them as objects.",WOMEN,185,3,CN,dialo_gold
A bitch will expect you to treat her with respect even when her body count is in the 100s… who tf do these hoes think they are,WOMEN,186,0,HS,dialo_gold
"If you judge a woman based on how many people she’s slept with, but you wouldn’t judge a man for the same thing, that’s a double standard!",WOMEN,186,1,CN,dialo_gold
I’m just saying there’s nothing respectful about that. These bitches aren’t even respecting themselves and they expect respect from men.,WOMEN,186,2,HS,dialo_gold
"It shouldn’t matter how many people somebody has slept with or who they are, you should treat them with respect because they’re a human being! Somebody’s sexual history has nothing to do with this.",WOMEN,186,3,CN,dialo_gold
The Muslim grooming gangs are a pandemic being ignored by the government and MSM. They are a threat to the UK. We need to defeat this filth.,MUSLIMS,187,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn’t that they’re Muslim, it’s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators",MUSLIMS,187,1,CN,dialo_gold

All of these white men committing mass killings and molesting children disgust me. They're totally appropriating Muslim culture!,MUSLIMS,188,0,HS,dialo_gold
How did you manage to put an Islamophobic spin on atrocities committed by white non-Muslim men?,MUSLIMS,188,1,CN,dialo_gold
"It's true though, makes a change to see a white murderers with all the violent Jihadis that are usually committing these acts.",MUSLIMS,188,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Do you think maybe that has more to do with your perception and what media you consume, than with who is committing crimes? If you are looking at news that disproportionately reports on Muslim perpetrators, you probably won't notice that Muslims make up a minority of the perpetrators compared to white non-Muslims.",MUSLIMS,188,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Everyone knows that terrorism is a Muslim problem, you don't see white guys suicide bombing places.",MUSLIMS,188,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Are the mass shootings that happen frequently in the US not a type of terrorism? Largely committed by lone white males. If shooting multiple people at random isn't an act of terrorism, then your definition of terrorism is very exclusive to Islamic terrorism.",MUSLIMS,188,5,CN,dialo_gold
What's another word for Islamophobia? Common sense.,MUSLIMS,189,0,HS,dialo_gold
What makes you say that?,MUSLIMS,189,1,CN,dialo_gold
"People are too afraid to speak up these days incase they get cancelled by the PC brigade, Islamophobia is just calling it as it is; a cult.",MUSLIMS,189,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Islam isn't a cult, it's only as much of a cult as any other major religion. If you don't agree with Islam you don't have to follow it but hating people because they do is wrong.",MUSLIMS,189,3,CN,dialo_gold
"You can't say anything about Muslims these days without being told it's Islamophobia though, this is why Muslims are getting away with so much, they can't be called out.",MUSLIMS,189,4,HS,dialo_gold
What do you think Muslims are 'getting away with'?,MUSLIMS,189,5,CN,dialo_gold
"violent crimes, rapes, trafficking and grooming, you name it. They're being let off light because people are scared of being labelled Islamophobic.",MUSLIMS,189,6,HS,dialo_gold
"I'd disagree with you there. There are plenty of recent examples of Muslim perpetators of these crimes being prosecuted, and if they've not been given long or appropriate sentences, I can almost guarantee that's nothing to do with them being Muslim, and probably more to do with how to court case went.",MUSLIMS,189,7,CN,dialo_gold
Not all Muslims are terrorists... Some are still in training.,MUSLIMS,190,0,HS,dialo_gold
Don't you think that Islamophobic stereotype is getting a bit old now? Obviously they're not all terrorists are they.,MUSLIMS,190,1,CN,dialo_gold
"There's no such thing as a moderate Muslim, I bet they all support the extremists even if they wouldn't say it openly.",MUSLIMS,190,2,HS,dialo_gold
"And that's based on what? Your misguided and uninformed perceptions of the Muslim community? The vast majority of Muslims are appalled at the actions of extremists, especially when it results in more hostility like this towards regular Muslims.",MUSLIMS,190,3,CN,dialo_gold
What’s the difference between E.T. and a Muslim refugee? E.T. learned to speak English and wanted to return home.,MUSLIMS,191,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Well E.T. probably wouldn't be returning home to civil war or persecution, which is why many refugees are forced to flee in the first place.",MUSLIMS,191,1,CN,dialo_gold
"I don't buy it, they just want to come here for the handouts. And they still don't bother to learn english.",MUSLIMS,191,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Would you give up your job, risk your life travelling in unsafe ways, and completely uproot your family just for a 'handout'? Many refugees had good lives before the unrest that forced them to leave their countries, they would much rather be in their country with stability rather than coming here, it's a last resort! Also, can you speak a second language?",MUSLIMS,191,3,CN,dialo_gold
"Not all of them, some of them don't have much to start with, they're uneducated and unemployable and come here hoping for a free ride. And no I can't speak another language because I don't need to, english is enough.",MUSLIMS,191,4,HS,dialo_gold
"If you can't speak a second language, then why do you feel so negatively about others who can't speak a second language (english) fluently? Most refugees would like to as it would help them to integrate but there are less government schemes for language classes now.",MUSLIMS,191,5,CN,dialo_gold

How is it 'Islamophobic' when most bombers are Middle Eastern and Muslim?,MUSLIMS,192,2,HS,dialo_gold
"It's Islamophobic because even though the stories of bombers you might see reported are mostly Muslims, most Muslims are not terrorists or bombers. Infact, Muslims in the middle east are probably the worst affected by bombs, not just from Islamic terrorism, but from Western interventionism.",MUSLIMS,192,3,CN,dialo_gold
These fags want to brainwash our kids by teaching their sick agenda in schools. We can’t stand for this.,LGBT+,193,0,HS,dialo_gold
What ‘agenda’ do you mean exactly?,LGBT+,193,1,CN,dialo_gold
Teaching them it’s normal to be a transgender or to have same sex relationships. They’re encouraging them into the lifestyle.,LGBT+,193,2,HS,dialo_gold
I don’t think that teaching kids that it’s okay to be gay or trans is ‘encouraging them’ to be those things. It will help lgbt kids to feel less marginalised though!,LGBT+,193,3,CN,dialo_gold
If they teach them it’s acceptable they’ll persuade some kids to try it.,LGBT+,193,4,HS,dialo_gold
"I really don’t think sexuality works like that. Schools didn’t teach about being lgbt+ in the past and there were still plenty of lgbt people. It’s not about knowing it exists, it’s about people who know they are lgbt feeling validated!",LGBT+,193,5,CN,dialo_gold
If you don't see the connection between legitimizing the queer lifestyle and an increase in STD's and sexual deviancy then you're blind...,LGBT+,194,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Most STDs are contracted by straight people, this has nothing to do with how societally acceptable queer relationships are!",LGBT+,194,1,CN,dialo_gold
"But telling people that it’s okay to be gay makes way for us normalising promiscuity, adultery, and other depraved behaviours. The queers have always been at it.",LGBT+,194,2,HS,dialo_gold
So you’re telling me no one straight was promiscuous or cheated in relationships before being LGBT was more acceptable? Sure.,LGBT+,194,3,CN,dialo_gold
I just wanted to take a second here and say something positive about the gay community… HIV.,LGBT+,195,0,HS,dialo_gold
That’s a harmful and outdated stereotype. The LGBT+ community is actually more aware and vigilant about the spread of HIV than straight people are because of awareness spread after the epidemic in the 80s.,LGBT+,195,1,CN,dialo_gold
So you’re saying all the homos did get it because there was the epidemic. So they are HIV positive…,LGBT+,195,2,HS,dialo_gold
"The epidemic affected all sorts of people, but the LGBT+ community were demonised in the media and blamed for it. Governments at the time didn’t respond quickly or appropriately which caused tons of unnecessary deaths. Unfortunately many LGBT people affected at the time aren’t with us anymore. Maybe educate yourself about it, there’s plenty of documentaries.",LGBT+,195,3,CN,dialo_gold

Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.,LGBT+,197,0,HS,dialo_gold

"If you can't imagine how lesbian sex works then I feel sorry for the women you have slept with! Why don't you just live and let live, lesbians exist whether you believe it or not!",LGBT+,197,3,CN,dialo_gold
Lesbians are just bitter man haters. what a miserable lifestyle.,LGBT+,198,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?",LGBT+,198,1,CN,dialo_gold
It's an unbalanced way to live. Then you see lesbians trying to act like men and be masculine to fill in for the lack of men in their lives.,LGBT+,198,2,HS,dialo_gold
"I don't think that's why some lesbians are more masculine. Someone's gender expression is about who they are and what makes them comfortable, it's not about making up for not having male influence in their lives.",LGBT+,198,3,CN,dialo_gold
I'm fine with gay people as long as they aren't gay around me.,LGBT+,199,0,HS,dialo_gold
So you're not fine with gay people then?,LGBT+,199,1,CN,dialo_gold
"No I'm fine with them living their lifestyle but I don't want my family exposed to it, what's wrong with that?",LGBT+,199,2,HS,dialo_gold
"If you don't think it's fine for your family to see, then you don't think it's fine. What is it about gay people that you don't want to 'expose' to your family?",LGBT+,199,3,CN,dialo_gold
"I don't want my children growing up thinking it's a normal lifestyle to have. Yes, some people can't help being gay, but that doesn't mean we should encourage it as a way of life.",LGBT+,199,4,HS,dialo_gold
"It's not 'encouraging' it. If you think exposing your children to gay people will 'encourage' them to be gay, I don't think you understand how sexuality works. If your children are gay, they'll be gay, if they're straight, they'll be straight, and you should love them for who they are either way!",LGBT+,199,5,CN,dialo_gold
"Girl, you're not bi. There's no such thing. You're just horny and greedy.",LGBT+,200,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Nope I'm bi, just because you can't wrap your head around the idea of attraction not being based on gender, it doesn't mean bi people don't exist!",LGBT+,200,1,CN,dialo_gold
"I don't know, it sounds like bi people are either gay and in denial or straight and experimenting.",LGBT+,200,2,HS,dialo_gold

Genuinely curious what you think would come next? And why it would be bad?,LGBT+,201,3,CN,dialo_gold
"They might start trying to normalise the more deviant parts of the lifestyle, you see those men dressed like dogs and stuff in pride parades, that stuff is messed up and we can't start telling kids thats normal.",LGBT+,201,4,HS,dialo_gold
"Kink/bdsm isn't necessarily a gay thing, yeah there's sometimes kink related groups at pride but this is very much a thing that straight people do too. It's really got nothing to do with gay marriage or gay rights of any sort.",LGBT+,201,5,CN,dialo_gold
"I hate when parents make a big deal about 'embracing' their kids being gay when they're only young teens. It's just a phase, they're too young to decide their sexuality, it's harmful to encourage this delusion.",LGBT+,202,0,HS,dialo_gold
"If they know, they know. What makes you think they don't know what they want?",LGBT+,202,1,CN,dialo_gold
They don't know what they want when they're just kids. They might just be saying they're gay cause they've seen it in a tv show or are fans of gay celebrities or something. Kids are very impressionable.,LGBT+,202,2,HS,dialo_gold
"We live in a very heteronormative society, where there's lots of pressure to be straight because it's the only sexuality that's normalised. If a teen is saying they're gay they will have realised this despite growing up in a society that assumes everyone is straight. If they're 'impressionable' then they would think they're straight!",LGBT+,202,3,CN,dialo_gold
If you left 1000 men on an island with 1000 women who were men but now according to morons on twitter are now women the islands would become extinct in a generation.,LGBT+,203,0,HS,dialo_gold
"Okay, what's your point?",LGBT+,203,1,CN,dialo_gold
These so called 'women' are not women. It's delusional.,LGBT+,203,2,HS,dialo_gold
So you think that what makes a woman a woman is her ability to have children?,LGBT+,203,3,CN,dialo_gold
Just saying these trannys could never do what women are biologically wired to do.,LGBT+,203,4,HS,dialo_gold
"If you put 1000 men on an island with 1000 cisgender women with reproductive health conditions that prevent them from getting pregnant, the population would still become extinct in a generation. Are you saying women who can't have children aren't women?",LGBT+,203,5,CN,dialo_gold
But they've got a womb. What I mean is if everyone woke up and decided to be a different gender then we'd all die out.,LGBT+,203,6,HS,dialo_gold

The phrase 'black lives matter' suggests racial superiority. It excludes the importance of anyone elses life. This is racism defined. We cannot bow down to these racists.,POC,205,0,HS,dialo_gold
Saying one thing matters does not insinuate that other things do not matter. You can care about and value more than one thing at once.,POC,205,1,CN,dialo_gold
What do the 'black lives matter' protesters do to show that they support white lives too?,POC,205,2,HS,dialo_gold
"Their purpose is to protest against anti-black racism, they don't need to show they care about white lives too. White lives mattering is implied in the structural privilege afforded to white people.",POC,205,3,CN,dialo_gold
"So they don't care about white lives?? Just what I said, they're racist.",POC,205,4,HS,dialo_gold
Single issue campaign groups don't have to prove they care about everyone else. This is like asking LGBT organisations what they do to advocate for straight people. They don't need to because straight people are accepted in society and don't face a disadvantage caused by their straightness.,POC,205,5,CN,dialo_gold
"It seems that some men will rape anything that moves, women, children, animals. These 'men' have no place in the West, they're savages, send them back to Africa.",POC,206,0,HS,dialo_gold

"You can't deny there's a pattern with all these news stories about migrant rapists, it's always the Africans who are coming over under the guise of being 'asylum seekers'. They just want to brutalise white women.",POC,206,2,HS,dialo_gold
"In over 90% of sexual assaults, the perpetrator is known to the victim, and is often a family member, partner, or friend. This suggests that when you see news stories about migrants raping girls in the street, the reason these stories made it into the news is because they're unusual and shocking.",POC,206,3,CN,dialo_gold
So you're just going to ignore the victims of those incidents?,POC,206,4,HS,dialo_gold
"No, those incidents do happen, but what I'm saying is that the majority of sexual assaults aren't committed by migrants, and to think that stopping migration would solve the issue of sexual violence against women is short sighted!",POC,206,5,CN,dialo_gold

"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there are factors, rather than race, affecting these statistics.",POC,1089,3,CN,session_1
Here's a statistics for you: African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. Isn't this proof enough?,POC,1089,4,HS,session_1

The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and goes unreported,MIGRANTS,473,5,CN,session_1
The world has become too violent. Too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.,POC,1394,0,HS,session_1

Negroes are the cause of all the problems in our nation. They are violent and unstable.,POC,1395,0,HS,session_1
