I think you have a different agenda.","6":"I\u2019m a patriot, I care about the future of our once great country.","7":"Can I suggest that greatness can be found in caring, compassion and concern for others and that these are the values we need to make us \u2018great\u2019 again.","8":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","9":"What\u2019s racist about it?","10":"It segregates people based on their colour.","11":"Isn\u2019t it more about making visible what\u2019s been largely invisible?","12":"It should be called what it really is\u2026Bad mouth whites\u2019 month","13":"I think the title is perfect\u2026signifying a celebration of individual and collective achievements.","14":"It\u2019s fake and harmful racial hatred driven by people who profit from it.","15":"I don\u2019t see expressions of hatred, but I\u2019d agree there is a profit for us all in understanding a largely hidden part of our shared histories.","16":"There\u2019s a rumour that Terry Gilliam\u2019s new production has been cancelled because the theatre is concerned about his anti-trans statements. More cancel culture madness!","17":"Its only a rumour, and he has grown into a curmudgeon in his old age. \ud83d\ude0a","18":"Its dangerous censorship and an assault on free speech.","19":"If the cancellation is true, then surely it\u2019s a theatre sticking by its principles and reminding us that rights also bring responsibilities.","20":"What about freedom of expression in the arts?","21":"But the rumoured cancellation is not related to the play he was planning.","22":"We need to protect our right to cause offence.","23":"But, he hasn\u2019t lost that right, just had a reminder that what we say affects how people view and treat us.","24":"More migrants crossing the channel today. We don\u2019t have enough accommodation. Our own homeless are forgotten. Send them back.","25":"Are you forgetting that last year every rough sleeper was offered a bed during lockdown?","26":"During lockdown.","27":"If there\u2019s a will there\u2019s a way.","28":"We don\u2019t have enough accommodation.","29":"Maybe, but to present migration as the sole cause of both homelessness and the shortage of affordable homes is nonsense.","30":"Local Councils can\u2019t afford to house the homeless, but Surrey is to get its first rainbow public crossing painted in time for Pride.","31":"Nice to see somewhere celebrating diversity and inclusivity.","32":"Its political correctness gone mad!","33":"Hardly, just a few layers of paint to mark Pride?","34":"They need to get their priorities right.

That, and the fact I keep seeing charities asking for donations of old phones for asylum seekers?","46":"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bullets\u2026I\u2019d happily volunteer!","47":"Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s a pity that a country that suffered so much under totalitarianism now adopts the same tactics?","48":"A proud country preventing an invasion.","49":"By beating back people caught in a crisis not of their own making?","50":"An army of potential terrorists and child molesters.","51":"We must be watching different news channels.

Foreigners shouldn\u2019t have access to legal aid.","61":"You don\u2019t believe that people, regardless of any allegation, deserve a fair trial?","62":"It\u2019s a bloody disgrace that we can\u2019t get rid of foreign child molesters and rapists.","63":"Whatever the criminal offence, these appeals are about the legality of the deportation, a complex area of law and hence why its one of the few grounds for entitlement to legal aid. Back to ensuring people get a fair trial.","64":"The legal system isn\u2019t fit for purpose!","65":"I\u2019d probably agree with you there, but I can\u2019t support the idea that we are NOT all EQUAL in the eyes of the law.","66":"These Muslim MP\u2019s should stop pretending they are British. They\u2019re not, they are just invaders!","67":"Given most were born here, you seem to be saying that you can\u2019t be Muslim and British\u2026which doesn\u2019t make sense","68":"They need to stop using the Racism card\u2026its just meaningless anti-white bullshit used to guilt-trip whites! We are sick of it!","69":"As a \u2018white person\u2019 I don\u2019t feel guilty, but I\u2019m happy to call out racism and Islamophobia when I encounter it.","70":"Islam isn\u2019t a race\u2026it\u2019s a death cult and incompatible with British society.","71":"I\u2019d suggest that racism and Islamophobia are contrary to British values of equality and religious freedom.","72":"This is a Christian country.","73":"Again, I\u2019d disagree since my experience is of a multi-faith society. Besides, I\u2019ve never voted based on the stated religion of a candidate.","74":"I\u2019ve just seen a video posted by a Patriot, of Muslim men of fighting age sleeping in a church because the asylum hotels are full. Free food, clothes and blankets\u2026they don\u2019t do that for our homeless!","75":"Well, they do. Using churches as homeless shelters has become common in recent years, so I\u2019d guess the church in question already had the experience to help these desperate people.","76":"Its giving succour to the enemy!","77":"Come on, its charity, what good Christians believe in.","78":"They\u2019re muzzies, they should be in a mosque!","79":"I doubt they had any choice about where they were put, and maybe there are no Mosques in the area. I\u2019m sure that Mosques up and down the country are doing their part.","80":"We should be sending they back not feeding and clothing them.","81":"Have you not read the story of the Good Samaritan? Isn\u2019t this what Jesus would want from his flock?","82":"Another County Cricket Club Chairman has resigned over \u2018historic\u2019 racist remarks from 4 years ago. This is becoming a witch hunt!","83":"I don\u2019t think racism was any more acceptable 4 years ago, than it is today.","84":"Who remembers what they said 4 years ago? End of cricket, the white man can\u2019t play anymore!","85":"I think I\u2019d remember an unacceptable and deeply offensive insult, regardless of how long ago, and of course white people can play cricket, they just need to learn not be racists.","86":"This is about silencing the majority, so they don\u2019t complain about being replaced.","87":"Nah\u2026just about ensuring players can thrive and aren\u2019t insulted and abused just because of who they are.","88":"We pick them up in the Channel, ferry them to Dover, house them in hotels, provide free food and an allowance. We welcome them, so no wonder they come.","89":"They come because they are desperate. Would you risk the sea in an open boat for a free pizza and a flea-pit hotel?","90":"We don\u2019t need them, and we can\u2019t even look after our own. We need to turn them back, not let them in.","91":"What about the so-called \u2018proud tradition\u2019 of welcoming those fleeing for their lives and our commitment to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which we had a hand in drafting?","92":"These are \u2018Economic migrants\u2019 or worse. If they were asylum seekers, they would claim sanctuary in the nearest safe country.","93":"Most do. Although, as you will now, The Convention does not require refugees to claim asylum in the first safe country they reach or make it illegal to seek asylum if a claimant has passed through another safe country.","94":"The indigenous people of Britain are being replaced!","95":"That\u2019s a different issued and while I disagree, I haven\u2019t got time to debate the notions of \u2018Britishness\u2019 today. Let\u2019s just hope that there are no more tragedies due to the channel crossing. You take care and have a nice day.","96":"How come these \u2018desperate\u2019 migrants all have mobiles, designer gear, trainers and can afford to pay thousands to people smugglers?","97":"Some will have sold homes, businesses, possessions. Others will be supported by family networks, loans from dear friends. \u2018Desperate\u2019 doesn\u2019t always mean \u2018poor\u2019. Many will be professionals, civil servants, lawyers, teachers.","98":"Rapists, terrorists, and child molesters!","99":"Families, women, and children, as well as young men fleeing war, famine, persecution, and oppression...","100":"Young men of fighting age, an invading army.","101":"Fleeing war, forced conscription, religious and political persecution, fear. Ask yourself, how bad would things have to be, to leave your home, family and country and face the ordeal these people have subjected themselves to?","102":"We are full, we don\u2019t need anymore migrants or asylum seekers.","103":"Population density varies and this, along with other factors like a failure to build homes causes local shortages but to say we are \u2018full\u2019 is not true or accurate. At the last count there were over 1 million empty properties in the UK.","104":"So why are people homeless and sleeping on the streets?","105":"Poverty, Eviction, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental health issues, unemployment, disability, PSD, failed asylum applications\u2026it\u2019s a long list.","106":"You agree that immigration is a contributor then?","107":"Yes of course, but only a small factor amongst many. Ask yourself, if we had no immigration, would that solve the housing shortage on its own?","108":"It might be a start.","109":"I\u2019d rather see more houses built, the empties let to tenants, adequate support for the homeless, the mentally ill and ex-service personnel, alongside the de-decriminalisation and support for people with addiction. That would be a better start.","110":"All these asylum seekers coming here and taking jobs away from native brits, no wonder this country is in a mess.","111":"Asylum seekers aren\u2019t actually allowed to work in the UK until they get refugee status, and often take jobs that native Brits don\u2019t want. Also, many people who migrate here start businesses, creating more jobs!","112":"They\u2019ll do it for less than minimum wage though, so we don\u2019t get offered the jobs because they\u2019ll do it for cheaper.","113":"That\u2019s the fault of exploitative employers who don\u2019t want to pay their workers properly, not the refugees for trying to make a living.","114":"Women getting into the labour market has caused the downfall of Western civilisation, they should be at home raising children. Abandoning traditional roles is the ruin of society.","115":"I\u2019d disagree, women should be able to choose what they do, but also even if some women did want to stay at home, many don\u2019t have a choice anymore! It\u2019s impossible to support a family on 1 wage now.","116":"Oh really? It didn\u2019t used to be impossible, it used to be the norm, what\u2019s changed?","117":"The cost of living has increased rapidly whilst wages have stagnated over the last few decades. This means that whilst 1 full time wage used to support a family, now with proportionately higher prices for things like food and housing, this isn\u2019t possible.","118":"The trans agenda don\u2019t want mens and womens toilets, everything has to be \u2018all in 1\u2019 now. Is this the future we want? Risking womens safety just so men in dresses feel comfortable?","119":"In some bars and cafes that I usually go to there are gender neutral toilets, and I've never had a problem with them. As long as people respect others and respect the space, 'all in 1' toilets work fine.","120":"But many wont and many will feel aggrieved by them. You choose to go to that bar\/cafe but public toilets will obviously become a problem.","121":"Yeah, it's bound to be unfamiliar to some people, but I'm just saying it can work without there being issues\/conflict. It's a question of what the norm is. A lot of student unions and universities today have gender neutral toilets, so that generation will be generally okay with it.","122":"Immigrants add to the cost of the NHS, get loads of money in benefits, and create a housing shortage. Time to close the borders.","123":"They also pay taxes, contributing to the cost of these services, and are less likely than native Brits to claim benefits, as many are not entitled to it!","124":"They still cost us a lot as a country, and if they're not on benefits it means there are less jobs for British people too","125":"Immigrants are also more likely to be business owners, meaning they create jobs.","126":"They probably only hire their own though","127":"Are you annoyed that immigrants are getting benefits or that they're taking jobs? Make up your mind","128":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","129":"If you consider supporting the LGBT+ community to be 'woke nonsense' then that sounds like your problem...","130":"We just don't need to see it everywhere, even the trains are no longer free of it. This is the start of them spreading their agenda.","131":"The LGBT+ community doesn't have an 'agenda' but public shows of support like this show people that homophobia and transphobia are unacceptable, and this might help some people feel safer in public spaces!","132":"Soon it will be 'sexist' to even talk to birds, everyone gets offended so easily these days you can't say anything.","133":"If you talk to women like they're people not 'birds' you shouldn't have a problem!","134":"I'll call them what I want","135":"Well, treating people with respect, like not using dehumanising or derogatory terms towards them, is usually a good idea if you want to be treated with respect back!","136":"All these muslims coming over here want to enforce sharia law and take over. We cannot submit!!!","137":"Muslims don't want to 'take over', even if they abide by sharia themselves, they're just trying to live alongside everybody else","138":"There's so many of them though, they're trying to replace us","139":"Only around 5% of the UK population are Muslim, non-Muslims are definitely not being replaced!","140":"All muslims are terrorists!","141":"That's not true, and it's a big generalisation, terrorists come from many backgrounds and religions, terrorism is not an exclusively Muslim issue","142":"So you're saying there are no Muslim terrorists?? Wake up","143":"No, there obviously are some terrorists who are Muslim, but the vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and are appalled by the actions of those who commit violent acts of extremism","144":"Jews want to take over the world and decimate Western civilisation!","145":"That's not true, where did you hear that?","146":"Have you heard of the great replacement? You should look it up. Jews are using their power to ruin the West and replace white people.","147":"The great replacement is a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Yes, there are some Jewish people in high powered positions but this doesn't mean these people are using their power to 'replace white people'.","148":"Gay people need to live separately from us so we don't catch AIDS from them.","149":"The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's was weaponised to spread homophobia and demonise gay people. Anybody can get HIV, straight or gay, and the vast majority of gay people do not have this illness. Those who do can manage their condition with daily medication, which makes it impossible to transmit.","150":"It's a gay disease, straight people don't get AIDS","151":"Yes they do, HIV which can develop into AIDS is actually more likely to be undiscovered in straight people, meaning there is more risk of it spreading. This is because after the epidemic the LGBT community became hyperaware of the risk, and generally get tested more.","152":"If black people aren't all criminals, why are they disproportionately arrested and taking up space in our prisons?","153":"Because of institutionalised racism in the Police, meaning they are more likely to get stopped and searched, randomly targeted, or assumed to be doing something 'suspicious'. Also because of the type of crimes the Police focus energy on e.g. street crimes that happen in poorer areas, which black people are more likely to live in, are given more Police attention than white collar crime.","154":"You can't blame everything on 'institutional racism'","155":"No, you can't, but it explains why more black people committing the same crimes that white people commit get caught. This is especially true for drug offenses, where white people are just as likely if not more likely to be in possession of drugs, but are way less likely to be searched.","156":"More boats at Dover today, the migrant invasion continues\u2026","157":"It\u2019s not a planned \u2018invasion\u2019, they\u2019re refugees fleeing to safety.","158":"If they\u2019re really \u2018refugees\u2019 why didn\u2019t they stop in the first safe country they got to?","159":"Some people come to the UK because they have family here, or speak English already, also not all countries that we consider \u2018safe\u2019 are safe for refugees, given the way they\u2019re treated by the Police in some places.","160":"SHARE if you think homeless veterans should be housed before any refugees!","161":"Both veterans and refugees should be housed! There is enough housing for all however a lack of social and affordable housing means lots of places lie empty. Everyone deserves to have a roof over their head.","162":"Veterans go to the bottom of the list like everybody else once they've left the barracks and army housing, we have to petition our own government to protect them.","163":"Yes I agree! In a country with this much wealth there should be protection for all vulnerable people, veteran or refugee.","164":"Why don\u2019t all these Muslim refugees go to other wonderful Muslim countries? Am I missing something?","165":"Actually, Muslim countries like Turkey, Pakistan, and Jordan take more refugees than any other countries. The percentage of refugees that come to the UK is tiny in comparison to the full amount of displaced people from conflicts in Syria, Afghanistan, etc.","166":"Why do we have so many coming here across the channel then? We\u2019re full, there\u2019s no room for them here.","167":"The number of displaced people is very high right now, and just as other countries are doing, we need to take our fair share. I would argue we definitely have a responsibility, especially since the UK has played a part in some of the conflicts that displaced them.","168":"How is it our fault if there\u2019s a war in some third world country?","169":"UK manufacturers profit from selling military equipment and weapons to these countries. The least we can do is help people who are fleeing violence there.","170":"LGBT history month now being taught in schools\u2026 I\u2019m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.","171":"We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!","172":"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when it\u2019s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.","173":"LGBT people have been persecuted until recently in the UK, and it's still illegal to be gay in over 70 countries. I think it's important that people see that there have always been LGBT people, throughout history and that LGBT identities are not 'new' or a 'trend', they're real.","174":"Jews are so greedy, they're always thinking about money","175":"That's a sweeping generalisation and an incorrect stereotype. You can't tar all Jewish people with the same brush! There's also a lot of 'greedy' people who aren't Jewish","176":"I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy","177":"From the way you're talking, it sounds like you haven't met many Jewish people at all. Maybe you need to interact with more people who are different from you, to understand their perspectives.","178":"Feminism gives women the muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.","179":"Nope, feminism is believing that a woman can go to work, have a husband, do both or neither, and all of those options are fine as long as it's what she wants to do.","180":"It\u2019s ok for who? For the long term of our civilisation? Groups that have more children, like Muslims, will grow and those who don't, like white women, will decline. Women need to be prioritising having a family.","181":"Women don't owe you children, if they don't want to have them and want to prioritise other things instead they have a right to. Children are a big commitment.","182":"But what about Western civilisation? If the white population doesn't reproduce we will become a minority.","183":"You're really going to make this about race? It doesn't make a difference to me what ethnicity or religion the children of the future are, we are all human!","184":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","185":"Why do you feel like LGBT people are dangerous?","186":"It's a slippery slope, first we accept gays and transgenders, next it will be pedophiles.","187":"There is no link between the LGBT+ community and paedophiles. These things have no connection.","188":"Are you saying there's no gay or trans paedophiles? Because that's a lie.","189":"No, I'm saying paedophilia and child abuse is not an LGBT+ issue, paedophiles can be straight, gay, or whatever else. People in the LGBT+ community are not advocating for paedophilia to be accepted, that's a false and harmful conception.","190":"Can't believe we are housing and feeding all these asylum seekers when they are coming over here ILLEGALLY","191":"They have to come here to be able to claim asylum at all, you have to be on UK soil to make a claim. It's not illegal to go to a country to claim asylum.","192":"Why do they come over hidden in lorries or in dinghies across the channel then? why not just get a flight?","193":"That's much easier said than done, especially when you're coming from a country in a state of unrest, or you don't have all of your documentation because you had to flee. Sometimes these routes are the only way.","194":"All muslims are rapists","195":"That's a sweeping generalisation, and it's not true at all. Sexual assault happens in all communities, and is committed by people from all backgrounds and religions.","196":"What about what happened in Rotherham and Rochdale? Grooming gangs are a big problem.","197":"Yes, the abuse carried out by Muslim grooming gangs in those places was horrific and can't be ignored, but sexual assault is extremely common unfortuately, and is usually committed in the home, often by a partner, family member, or someone known to the victim. This means that the vast majority of sexual assaults are not committed by Muslims.","198":"Do you have any evidence about that?","199":"Yes, here's an article (link to article about sexual assault statistics)","200":"Muslims want to invade us and enforce sharia law!","201":"No, the vast majority of Muslims just want to be able to live their lives, they don't care if others follow sharia.","202":"How do you explain the Taliban then?","203":"Every religion has extremists, but the vast majority of Muslims condemn the actions of terrorist groups like the Taliban. They do not reflect Muslims as a whole.","204":"As much as the media tries, you can't convince me to take transgenders seriously. A man can put on a dress and make up but at the end of the day they're still a man. That's basic biology.","205":"It's not 'biology'. You're confusing sex and gender. Gender has nothing to do with our biology or body, it's about our identity and how we feel. Sex is our anatomy, hormones etc, but even this isn't as binary as many people beleive.","206":"What do you mean sex isn't binary? There's men and there's women, nothing inbetween.","207":"No, there are many people who don't fit into the sex binary, for example intersex people. Also people have different hormone levels, and reproductive organs. This shows things aren't as clear cut as there just being 2 sexes!","208":"I tolerated fag pride, I tolerated seeing fags on tv, but I draw the line at schools teaching children about their perverted lifestyles. This is indoctrination.","209":"Teaching about LGBT relationships in schools isn't trying to indoctrinate children, it's just teaching kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.","210":"I don't know if homosexual relationships are ever healthy or happy...","211":"There are plenty of happy and healthy gay relationships, and it's important for children to see these normalised so they don't feel shame, or feel like they have to hide if they realise they are gay.","212":"and what about all the straight kids? Having this rammed down their throats isn't good for them","213":"It's important for them to be educated about LGBT relationships too so they don't become hateful and hostile. We should raise children to accept everybody for who they are.","214":"If we accept transgenders it's a slippery slope. First you can identify as whatever gender you want, then it will be whatever age they want. Suddenly paedophilia is something we're being told to accept...","215":"There's no link between transgender people and paedophilia. Paedophiles can be straight, gay, trans, or cisgender, it's not a trans issue.","216":"It's perversion all the same. You must be able to see how allowing these freaks to have their way is harmful.","217":"No, it's not harmful or perverted. Transgender people just want to be able to live their lives in a way they feel comfortable. It's not about 'perversion' or paedophilia.","218":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","219":"Why does it disgust you?","220":"We need to keep the white race alive, polluting it by breeding with blacks means there will be less white children in the future.","221":"Why do you care what colour children are? People are free to have children with whoever they want and it's quite authoritarian to say they shouldn't.","222":"If you need any more proof that whites and blacks are not equal, look at the technological advancement achieved by each. Whites took us to space, Africans are still living in third world shitholes. We are not the same.","223":"Actually, did you know some of the most essential work done at NASA to launch space exploration missions was done by a group of black female mathematicians?","224":"No I didn't, sounds fake, is it true?","225":"Yes, look up 'hidden figures', a film was recently made based on the true story of the mathematicians who were instrumental to some of the early NASA missions.","226":"We are letting Muslim terrorists come to our country as 'refugees'. This has got to stop.","227":"The people coming to our country as refugees are not terrorists, in a lot of cases they're fleeing terrorism","228":"So you're saying none of them are terrorists? We know that's a lie, Muslim migrants commit crimes all the time.","229":"Sure there might be a few people who have violent extremist views, but these people are not representative of the Muslim community in any way.","230":"Blacks and civilisation are incompatible. You can have a thriving society or you can have diversity, you can\u2019t have both.","231":"I have to disagree. Some of our brightest thinkers, visionaries, inventors, scientists etc are black people. It's ignorant to dismiss the black excellence that is so influential in our society.","232":"Oh yeah, like who?","233":"Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, Madam C. J. Walker, Maya Angelou... need I go on?","234":"I\u2019ve never met a happy gay person. It\u2019s a miserable, perverted lifestyle. Those people need help.","235":"I know plenty of happy people in the LGBT community, what can make people miserable is the homophobia they have to face!","236":"People who take that route in life have mental issues, I doubt homophobia is the reason they're miserable since our society is so 'woke' now.","237":"Your views about gay people are proof themselves that homophobia is still prevalent today. You don't have to understand other peoples identities, but respecting them costs nothing.","238":"Ask yourself after millions of immigrants have entered the UK, many illegally","239":"Equating all these things to immigration seems illogical. Lots of changes have happened in the last 30 years socially, culturally, economically. Surely these things have more to do with the governments that have presided in this time and the economy? Not just immigration?","240":"So you feel safe with all these rapists and criminals out on our streets?","241":"You can\u2019t assume all crime in the UK is because of immigrants. Sure, some immigrants commit crimes, but so do some British people, maybe crime rates are much more to do with poverty and people lacking opportunities in life, rather than nationality or race?","242":"Pro-trans zealots view themselves as a virtuous and inclusive subset of \"progressive modernisers\". In reality, they are responsible for the growing social erasure of women. This cultural assault on women's rights is uncivilised and not to be tolerated.","243":"As a woman myself, I can tell you that trans people having rights doesn't affect my rights one bit. I'd say a bigger threat to women's rights are things like low conviction rates for sexual assault, domestic violence, etc.","244":"When their rights trump or override women\u2019s hard won rights then it is a problem. When it affects women's safe spaces then it\u2019s a problem. There\u2019s evidence to show that abuse of these rights are happening.","245":"Okay, what rights are they infringing on, and what evidence? Trans people don\u2019t want to cause problems for women, they just want to get on with their lives like anyone else.","246":"Everywhere you look on tv now, white people are being erased. Every advert has mixed race families, openly promoting miscegenation, no white men anywhere. This is all part of their plan to decimate the white race.","247":"There are so many white people on tv, if you think there isn't you're obviously not paying attention!","248":"There\u2019s so many more black and Asian people on tv now, it\u2019s ridiculous, this is what they\u2019re trying to make us think is \u2018normal\u2019.","249":"Just because there is more representation of ethnic minorities doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no white people, it\u2019s just more proportional now. Other people being represented doesn\u2019t mean white people are being \u2018erased\u2019 or \u2018oppressed\u2019, it just means the industry is more representative of what society actually looks like.","250":"Hundreds of Muslim men, all of fighting age, arriving in boats every day. This is what invasion looks like, we must be ready to fight back.","251":"What does 'of fighting age' mean? They're not here to fight, they're here because they want a peaceful life and many are fleeing war, persecution, or hardship.","252":"With the amount of them coming over they would have a lot of manpower if they came together to take over the country.","253":"That's ridiculous though, people seeking asylum or migrating here aren't all conspiring together to 'take over', sounds like you've been reading one too many conspiracy theories...","254":"The more diverse a community the less people volunteer, vote, give to charity, and trust each other. This is why blacks are incompatible with our civilisation.","255":"Where is this from and is it generalisable at all?","256":"I read it on an academic blog, the article makes some good points about the advantages of homogenous racial communities.","257":"I'd encourage you to be critical of using blogs as sources for information, it could be biased or unreliable. Maybe the reason the article came to this conclusion is because more diverse communities are likely to be poorer because of economic inequalities faced by minorities?","258":"Why would that make a difference?","259":"Well maybe economic hardship is the reason why people in these communities volunteer, vote, and give less, because they don't have the time or resources to.","260":"Just read an article that explained how the Jewish elite use their positions of power to control us!","261":"Where did you read this article? Are you sure it's from a source you can trust?","262":"It's from a website I get a lot of my news from, I would say it's pretty trustworthy.","263":"Please read with a critical eye, you can't trust everything on the internet! This sounds like a source with an agenda, of course people in positions of power can exploit their status but the fact that the article suggests it's because they're Jewish makes me think the writer has an agenda. Maybe see if this story is being reported by any other sources too.","264":"Just seen a story about a park in Manchester where Muslims are banning people from walking their dogs because it offends them!!! Trying to enforce sharia law, it's time we take our country back!!","265":"This is actually fake news! There's a website which shows the posters put up in the park to 'ban' dog walking were put there by people trying to stir up hate against the Muslim community. Don't believe everything you read!","266":"Are you sure? Sounds like something Muslims would do.","267":"Yep, here's the source showing how it was planned. A good way to check if something is real in the future is to cross reference it with other news sites, to see if other sites with different perspectives have reported on the same stories.","268":"Just seen an article exposing how the trans agenda is targeting children and trying to get them to become trannies! This is madness!","269":"Where did you read this? Are you sure it's from a reliable source? This sounds like inflammatory fake news.","270":"The article talked about how they want children to come to Pride, probably so they can indoctrinate them!","271":"It sounds like you're twisting a news story about Pride being family friendly into something that it's not. Be careful how you relay news that you have read. It can be taken out of context quite easily!","272":"Has anyone read all the stuff about the Jewish paedophile ring that controls our country? Can't believe some people think jews are 'persecuted'...","273":"Where did you read this? This sounds like it could be harmful misinformation spread to encourage hate towards Jewish people","274":"There's a blog that posts a lot about it, you should check it out, it's insane what's going on...","275":"Be careful when getting your news from 'blogs', they can be very unreliable, and are somethings just one persons opinions or theories, some of which are not backed up by evidence!","276":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","277":"Migrants actually don't get given a lot by the government, and asylum support benefits are much much lower than universal credit given to British citizens. They have to be put in hotels temporarily whilst they are processed.","278":"I don't know, looks like they're given everything on a plate...","279":"It's actually very tough surviving as a new migrant in the UK, especially if you are seeking asylum, living on \u00a330-40 a week for all expenses, when the base rate for those on universal credit is around \u00a3110.","280":"Wow that's actually not a lot, but what about the other stuff, free healthcare and stuff when they've never paid in in their lives?","281":"A lot of migrants really want to contribute to our society, so they will pay into public funds as they start earning here, or might become job creators by starting businesses.","282":"Just seen that a migrant family (Muslim of course) have been given a house worth 1 MILLION by the government because they have so many kids. FFS we can't keep paying for these people to live in luxury!!","283":"Knowing the way social housing works, that doesn't sound true, do you have a link to the article? I wonder if it's reliable...","284":"Yes here, makes me so angry that they just come over here expecting to be given everything and not work for it.","285":"This is fake news! This site is known to be a very biased and unreliable source. If you do a reverse image search on the picture of the family used, they are a stock photo! Don't believe everything you read.","286":"Just seen a video on facebook about 'drag queen story time' where men dressed as women indoctrinate kids into thinking this is 'normal'. What is the world coming to?","287":"Drag queen story time is not trying to indoctrinate kids with anything, it's just a fun event and the kids like the drag queens because they're colourful and sparkly.","288":"But showing kids this stuff? Is that safe? What are they going to grow up thinking?","289":"They'll probably grow up with a more open mind towards gender expression in all it's forms, and I don't think that's a bad thing!","290":"4 million people waiting for NHS treatments but we can still afford to spend 2 BILLION on health tourism for people who have paid nothing into the NHS...","291":"Health tourism actually only makes up 0.3% of the NHS budget, stop scapegoating migrants for the state of the NHS, when the real problem is that it has been critically underfunded for years.","292":"What about all the migrants that come here and stay? Using our NHS for years whilst probably sponging even more off our government in benefits.","293":"Actually, migrants with leave to remain in the UK have to pay a health surcharge of around \u00a3300 towards the NHS, so they don't pay in nothing, they contribute.","294":"All these asylum seekers coming here and expecting benefits, not wanting to work. Why are we letting in such lazy people?","295":"Actually, a lot of asylum seekers really want to work, but it's illegal for them to do so whilst their claim is being processed. They are only allowed to live on asylum support in this time.","296":"Sounds like a cushy life, not being allowed to work and having to just lay about all day getting benefits.","297":"Asylum support is a very small amount of money to live on and many really want to work. Some take cash in hand work but this can often be underpaid and exploitative because it's illegal, and if it's found they have been working their claim can be rejected.","298":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","299":"It's definitely a disgrace that in such a rich country we leave homeless people on the streets, especially when there's actually enough housing for everyone it's just not distributed properly. Migrants don't have an easy time either though, and it's not their fault that the government ignores homelessness as an issue.","300":"But shouldn't we be putting our homeless veterans in the hotels and houses that migrants get? That makes a lot more sense to me","301":"No, because there actually is enough housing for everyone, it's just distributed unevenly. The government has decimated it's supply of social housing over the last few decades, and many cities are filled with overpriced unsold flats. If we could repurpose some of these builds, or if they could be let out at a more affordable rate, we wouldn't have this problem.","302":"We have a shortage of housing and yet we're still giving migrants free flats, houses, or putting them up in fancy hotels. Why does our government bend over backwards to accommodate people who have never contributed anything to this country?","303":"We don't actually have a shortage of housing, there are estimated to be around 600,000 empty homes. Also, the housing that migrants often get allocated is very low quality, sometimes to the point that it can be dangerous to people's health.","304":"If there are so many empty homes how come British people have to wait so long to get a house?","305":"The government has decimated it's supply of social housing over the last few decades with policies such as the 'right to buy' scheme. It should invest in it so that British people and migrants can all access affordable housing!","306":"Migrants coming here for health tourism are bankrupting our NHS, how come we just keep letting them come over? They should be refused from hospitals if they can't prove they are citizens here.","307":"The point of the NHS is that it's for everyone, free at the point of use. To start checking where someone is from and then possibly refuse them service because of it goes against everything the NHS was built on.","308":"What about the huge cost of it though? We need to stamp out health tourism","309":"Actually, heath tourism makes up about 0.3% of the total NHS budget, so whilst some people might exploit it, it's not a big problem. A bigger problem is how underfunded the NHS is and how it's staff's wages haven't risen for years!","310":"We need to put a stop to these migrants coming here over the channel in dinghies, they just come here so they can claim asylum support and live an easy life, sponging off the British government whilst we all pay for them.","311":"Most asylum seekers really want to work but they're not allowed to unless their claim is accepted and they gain refugee status.","312":"Are you sure? If they're getting benefits for free why would they?","313":"Because asylum support is less than \u00a340 a week, for everything, which a lot of people would struggle to live on. They also want to integrate into society and become part of their communities, and working can be a good way to do this, but they're not allowed!","314":"These migrants that come over and work for cash in hand, undercutting whatever Brits will work for, are harming our industries. It's so hard to get work now because there'll always be some Eastern European who'll do it for cheaper!","315":"Surely the problem here is not the migrants trying to make a living but the exploitative employers who are hiring people for less than minimum wage and underpaying them?","316":"I guess so, but it means they always get picked for jobs because they always go with who can do it cheapest","317":"This kind of employment causes lots of problems for migrants too though, because there's no accountability they sometimes don't get paid at all, or will end up working for next to nothing or a meal instead of real pay. Maybe migrant and British workers need to come together to take a stand against exploitative employers?","318":"immigrants are pushing our school system to it's limits! More and more pupils from non-white backgrounds whilst the white population stays stagnant, and spending per pupil has gone down. They need to stop taking up resources for British people!","319":"I hardly think the fact immigrants have children is the reason why the education system is under pressure, maybe the government needs to fund it better? It seems like a stretch to say that pupil spending going down is due to migration.","320":"Well they're having more kids per family than white British families are, that means they're sending more kids into our schools.","321":"I think you're trying to make an issue out of something that's not a problem. People have children, the children go to school, it doesn't matter if they're white or not, or British or not.","322":"Makes me laugh when women moan about not being paid as much as men, maybe that\u2019s because you should be at home cleaning and child rearing?","323":"Women have proven to be just as proficient as men in paid employment and should be paid equally to reflect this. Your attitudes are stale and outdated.","324":"It\u2019s not in their nature to excel in the skills men are better at.","325":"Maybe the skills you\u2019re talking about don\u2019t come more naturally to men, maybe it\u2019s because men are socialised to value things like strength and logic, whilst women are taught to care more about things like their appearance.","326":"Allowing women to vote is one of the worst things to happen to our society. They can't use logic like men can to make decisions about things like politics.","327":"Women fought hard for their right to vote and deserve to have a say about who's running the country.","328":"Their brains can't fully comprehend the pros and cons of different parties in an election","329":"I'd strongly disagree with that, if you hold the belief that women can't think for themselves like men do, I suggest you get more women in your life because you obviously don't see them as people and need to understand that they're your equals!","330":"Shouted across the road to complement a bird the other day and she told be to f*** off. You can't say anything anymore without it being seen as 'sexist'! PC gone mad.","331":"If you want to complement someone, you can approach them and politely talk to them, shouting at a woman across the road is cat calling and might have made her feel unsafe in public!","332":"It's a complement though, she's not 'unsafe' around me.","333":"You know that, but she doesn't. Public spaces can be daunting for women when they get cat called. It's a show of male dominance, letting women know they are being watched. Especially if she was on her own, I can see how she might be annoyed or intimidated.","334":"I don't know how girls nowadays expect to be treated with respect when they go out wearing next to nothing, looking like sluts.","335":"Women deserve respect whatever they're wearing because they are human beings, it shouldn't matter what clothes someone is wearing.","336":"But they go out in tiny skirts with their boobs out and wonder why guys don't see them as more than a sex object? They're sexualising themselves.","337":"Even if someone is sexualising themselves, it's not your problem or your business. Why do you care what someone else you don't even know wears? There are probably some women who don't agree with your fashion choices but they don't tell you because it's none of their business.","338":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","339":"It's because it's dehumanising and is sometimes used in a derogatory or objectifying way. Maybe refer to women as women and you won't have a problem?","340":"I didn't say it to be derogatory, she just took it the wrong way, and I should be able to say what I want.","341":"Sure, you can say what you want, but there's a basic level of respect that you need to have for another person if you want them to treat you with respect back e.g. you can say 'bird' if you want but the woman you said it to can be angry back at you if she wants because she doesn't like being called that!","342":"Why are there so many female politicians these days? Women are not natural born leaders like men are.","343":"How can you say that? There are so many female politicians doing a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better.","344":"Oh yeah? Like who? There are female politicians but not many female leaders as they never get that far, because they're not cut out for it.","345":"Jacinda Arden, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, for one. She managed to lead a country through a pandemic more successfully than any other countries ruled by men, and has dealt well with events like extreme weather events, terrorist attacks, all done diplomatically and calmly.","346":"The jews are the reason we have the problems we have today. Diversity, immigration, feminism, it's all part of their plan to destroy European people and their culture.","347":"This isn't true, what gave you this idea?","348":"Have you read about the Kalergi Plan? If not, I'd suggest you look it up. It explains how the jews in power are the ones pushing these societal changes to subordinate white people.","349":"The Kalergi Plan is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory, it's not based in any truth. Please look up some critiques of it, there's a lot of literature on the internet about it but if you only read one side, you can end up believing things that are wildly untrue!","350":"Jews always pretend to be persecuted victims when in reality they're the ones controlling us.","351":"Jewish people have historically been persecuted and anti-Semitism today still stems from these historic events, but Jewish people aren't 'controlling us', what gives you that idea?","352":"There are a disproportionate amount of Jews in positions of power like government, media, banks etc. There's an imbalance of power.","353":"Yes, some fields have disproportionate amounts of certain demographics, but this doesn't mean Jewish people are all in on some plot to 'control' us. There's also a disproportionate number of white men in positions of power but there's no conspiracies about them getting together as a group to exert 'control'.","354":"The holocaust never happened. It's all a lie to make people feel sorry for Jews.","355":"There's lots of evidence that the holocaust happened, survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of lives ended. How can you say it never happened when there's so much evidence to show that it did?","356":"That's all fabricated, I've been reading about it and it can all be explained.","357":"What about the 6 million people that died? The Jewish population wasn't decimated for no reason, there was a genocide. To deny this is ignorant and insulting.","358":"Jews are the reason we have so many third world immigrants in our country, they want us whites replaced.","359":"This isn't true, what makes you say this?","360":"They are consciously trying to replace the white race, you should read about the Great Replacement, it explains exactly what's happening.","361":"The great replacement is an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory that's not based in facts or evidence. If you're going to do so much research into it, you should also read the criticisms of it, to get a balanced view.","362":"homosexuals are mentally ill. No one in their right mind would think this perverted behaviour is okay.","363":"Being gay isn't a mental illness, it's a perfectly normal lifestyle.","364":"There's nothing normal about two men being together.","365":"I suggest you educate yourself about the LGBT community. If you actually talked to some real gay people you'd see that there's really no difference between you and them, everyone is just trying to live their lives in a way that makes them happy.","366":"How much danger are we putting children in by letting gay couples adopt? We don't know how they're raising them or what they might do to them...","367":"There are so many gay couples that give kids great lives through adoption, why do you think they shouldn't adopt?","368":"They might try and indoctrinate the kids into being gay too.","369":"Just because the parents are gay doesn't mean they would raise their kids as 'gay'. If anything gay parents know what it's like to be scared of coming out, and so would probably want their kids to feel comfortable being whatever they are.","370":"The kids will grow up in a twisted family structure too though, they'll think it's normal to not have a mum, or in lesbian couples, a father.","371":"They're being adopted? I'm sure these children care more that their adoptive parents are caring and loving rather than what gender they are. Isn't it better that a same sex couple adopts rather than a child growing up without a family?","372":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","373":"LGBT people have no agenda, they're just trying to get on with their lives in peace! What do you mean about the traditional family?","374":"Teaching people it's alright to be in same sex relationships means there will be less traditional nuclear families in the future, which will be bad for our society.","375":"I don't think it's necessary for people to be in nuclear families for 'society'. Same sex relationships and families are valid and real. Why do you care what other people's relationships or families look like?","376":"How will they have children?","377":"They can adopt, use surrogacy, or they might not want children and that's okay too!","378":"Fags want their agenda taught in schools now, this is harmful to our children and has got to stop!","379":"What exactly have you seen will be taught in schools?","380":"They want learning about LGBT to be part of sex and relationship education. How many children are going to grow up thinking these freaks are 'normal'?","381":"LGBT relationships are normal and completely valid. If we're teaching children about straight relationships, why wouldn't we teach them about other orientations too?","382":"But teaching kids about this might encourage them to be gay, they're too young when they're in primary school and very easily influenced.","383":"Have you heard of the term 'compulsory heterosexuality'? There is a lot of conditioning in our society that assumes all people are straight and forces them to behave in a way in line with this. I wouldn't worry about LGBT relationships being acknowledged in schools 'turning' kids gay when so much of our media and socialisation tells people they are straight.","384":"Poofs spread AIDS","385":"The HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80's disproportionately affected the LGBT community but today HIV is easily dealt with with medication which makes it untransmitable and undetectable. It's also not very common, in gay or straight people.","386":"How are we meant to know which ones have it though?","387":"That's not your problem. As I said, people who have HIV now have medication which makes the disease manageable, untransmitable, and undetectable. Also, you can only catch HIV through sex or if it were to get in your bloodstream, not just from being around someone. The biggest issue with HIV today is the stigma around it!","388":"LGBT history month now being taught in schools\u2026 I\u2019m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.","389":"We still can teach British, European and World history, but part of that is looking at the history of groups which have been erased from our history previously. Looking at the some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK can inform the future for everyone!","390":"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when it\u2019s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.","391":"LGBT people have been persecuted until recently in the UK, and it's still illegal to be gay in over 70 countries. I think it's important that people see that there have always been LGBT people, throughout history and that LGBT identities are not 'new' or a 'trend', they're real.","392":"Pride disgusts me, homosexuals parading their deviant lifestyles in public like they have anything to be proud of.","393":"They do have a lot to be proud of! The LGBT community has fought hard to win basic rights for themselves, they should be proud of their struggle, and of their identities, especially when many have been told to be ashamed of them for so long.","394":"There's a reason they weren't accepted in the past, I can't believe we 'celebrate' this behaviour now.","395":"Yes, the reason was ignorance and fear of the otherness that some people saw in LGBT people. I'm glad we're at a place as a society now where the majority of people accept that everyone is different, and who somebody chooses to love is none of anyone's business, and is definitely not their problem!","396":"Tolerating fag pride means we let the feminisation of our society happen. This will have consequences.","397":"What do you mean by 'feminisation' and what are the consequences?","398":"Men aren't real men anymore, telling men it's okay to be gay or to dress in womens clothing is making men soft and eroding our traditional roles and the nuclear family.","399":"There's nothing unmanly about being gay, and for men who like to express femininity, there's nothing wrong with that either. If anything it shows they are secure enough in their masculinity to experiment. For others, such as non binary people and trans women, I'm glad we now live in a society where there is more acceptance of people expressing their gender however they feel is right.","400":"It disgusts me when I see women who think they're lesbians. They obviously have a mental illness or haven't found the right man to show them how much happier they'd be in a normal relationship.","401":"Or maybe they're just lesbians so they're not interested in men? You can't force someone to be something they're not, and it doesn't affect you if they choose to be in same sex relationships.","402":"It's not natural, lesbianism makes women take on masculine roles that are better suited to men.","403":"It sounds like you don't know any lesbians in real life. Gender roles are socially conditioned into us, whether someone feels more feminine or masculine, again, is none of your business and doesn't affect you in any way!","404":"It's vile that we are confusing children with bisexual characters on tv\u2026 whatever next? trans SpongeBob?","405":"There's nothing vile or confusing about bisexuality. I'm sure children can wrap their heads around it. It simply means someone is attracted to more than one gender. What's so hard to get about that?","406":"There are only two genders.","407":"Bisexual people might be attracted to men, women, non-binary people, etc. The point is that it's about the person and who they are, not their gender.","408":"Now the innocence of children is being eroded by comics with a bi-sexual superman. How can we protect our children from this nonsense?","409":"Nothing about superman being bisexual is eroding the innocence of children. If you can teach children about straight relationships, you can teach them that bisexuals exist. If you think otherwise, you need to be educated about bisexuality. If you have any questions ask them!","410":"It's teaching them that it's normal to have sexual relationships with multiple people, men or women, there's no morality in it.","411":"Being bisexual doesn't mean that you have multiple partners at once (although some people bi, straight, or gay do choose to), it just means you are attracted to more than one gender. For me bisexuality means being attracted to someone because of who they are as a person, not because of gender. There's nothing harmful about teaching children about that!","412":"First there's bisexual characters on tv, next we're normalising child marriage. It's a slippery slope...","413":"There's absolutely no link between bisexuality and child marriage. What are you implying?","414":"Normalising deviance and making people accept it opens us up as a society to having to 'accept' even more perverted things.","415":"There's nothing 'deviant' about bisexuals. It really doesn't affect anyone else if someone chooses to be with a man, a woman, or a non-binary person.","416":"Superman is now bisexual?? He has become a bit of a slag - with no morals and a predator he\u2019s happy to get it away with anyone he comes across.","417":"Bisexuals aren't 'slags', being attracted to people of all genders doesn't make you a predator or mean that you have 'no morals' it just means gender isn't the deciding factor in who you're attracted to.","418":"Sounds like they can't make up their minds and are confused. Probably some of these people are gay and in denial or straight and greedy.","419":"Those are outdated stereotypes about bisexuals. They don't have to make up their minds because you can be attracted to different sorts of people. Are you attracted to people with blonde hair or brown hair, and if you can't pick one, does that make you 'confused'? Think of it that way. There's no need to 'pick a side'.","420":"Can't believe they are making tv characters that have been around for years 'bisexual' now. This is PC gone mad.","421":"Why does it bother you?","422":"Why do we have to bring sexuality into things like tv shows? It's not necessary, just all part of the woke agenda.","423":"It's good to have representation. a few decades ago there were no bisexual characters on tv. Seeing them would have made young bisexual people feel validated and less ashamed about coming out.","424":"Making tv characters bisexual is an attack on white masculinity. We are being erased.","425":"There are still plenty of white men on tv, some just happen to be bisexual. How is it an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine, and are sometimes more secure in their masculinity than many straight men as their masculinity isn't dependent on heterosexuality!","426":"There's nothing masculine about being bent","427":"If your masculinity is dependent on proving how straight you are, it sounds quite fragile. What is masculinity anyway?","428":"Superman is now bisexual, apparently. Why is he still called superMAN?","429":"Bisexual men are men?","430":"Doesn't sound very manly, sounds gay.","431":"Gay men are men too. Do you only think of straight men as men?","432":"It's just not normal is it, not how men are supposed to act.","433":"Who decides how men are 'supposed' to act? Have a think about your views on masculinity. What makes a man a man? If you think being straight is the only thing that makes a man a man you need to think again.","434":"Bisexuals are greedy.","435":"No, that's an outdated stereotype. There's nothing greedy about being attracted to people because of who they are as people, not because of their gender!","436":"Why don't they just stick with men or women? It's greedy to have both.","437":"It doesn't affect anyone else who bisexual people love. Also, you can't choose who you're attracted to!","438":"Bisexuals are confused, they can't make up their minds. They are mentally ill.","439":"Why do they need to 'make up their minds'? Can't they just be attracted to whoever they are attracted to?","440":"It's confusing, sounds like they haven't figured out their sexuality.","441":"It sounds like the only person confused here is you, and you don't need to be, because it's none of your business who other people are attracted to.","442":"Why are we being told to accept bisexuality as 'normal' now. Nothing normal about that.","443":"There are plenty of bisexuals in the world, it's actually very common to be bisexual. What is not normal about that?","444":"It's saying that cheating is acceptable. Surely if someone is bisexual they will always want both men and women. How could you trust them in a relationship?","445":"Bisexual people are not more likely to cheat than straight or gay people. Just because you are attracted to more than one gender doesn't mean you need to be dating people of all genders at once! In the same way that you might be attracted to people with blue eyes or brown eyes, but you don't need to be dating one of each at once!","446":"First we tell kids it's okay to be 'bisexual', next they are confused and we are telling them they have to change genders. It's a dangerous path.","447":"There's no link between being bisexual and wanting to transition genders. These two things aren't related.","448":"It's a gateway for the trans agenda.","449":"No, it's a legitimate sexuality. It has nothing to do with the persons own gender. Also, there is no 'agenda', trans people just want to exist!","450":"Bisexual men are just fags in denial","451":"No bisexual men are bisexual men. You can be attracted to more than one gender you know.","452":"No straight man would entertain the idea.","453":"Yeah and they're not straight, they are bisexual. It's not that hard to understand, and it's also none of your concern who other people choose to love!","454":"Just seen an article about Muslims telling women in Manchester they have to wear burqas, they are enforcing sharia law!","455":"Where did you read that? Are you sure that's true?","456":"I saw an article about it online, sounds true enough to me.","457":"I would check if there are any other websites that have reported it. You can't always trust online news sites.","458":"According to this research, 3 in 5 Muslims support extremism and terrorism. There is no such thing as a moderate Muslim.","459":"What research? That sounds unlikely, and definitely exaggerated.","460":"Here's a link to it.","461":"This website doesn't look very reliable, it just looks like someone's personal blog. I think they have just made those figures up. The vast majority of Muslims don't support terrorism!","462":"Muslims are calling for dogs to be banned as pets because they are seen as \u2018dirty\u2019 in the Quran! We cannot comply with their agenda.","463":"Where are Muslims calling for this? This doesn't sound true.","464":"I saw an article about how they were putting posters up in a park telling people not to bring their dogs there.","465":"This story has been debunked, it was actually a campaign targeting Muslims to stir up Islamophobic hate, Muslim's don't care if you have a dog as a pet!","466":"Muslims are taking over our country! This article explains how they want to replace to white British population.","467":"This article sounds like a conspiracy theory. British Muslims just want to live alongside everybody else, there's no 'agenda' to take over.","468":"I don't know, this guy makes some good points.","469":"I wouldn't trust everything you read online, especially on individual blogs which are made to look like news sites or 'citizen journalism'.","470":"Muslims want to ban non-halal meat!! They are taking control of our country.","471":"Where did you see that? I don't think they do.","472":"Here's an article about it.","473":"This article is talking about one particular man, not all Muslims. You can't generalise this, most Muslims only eat halal but don't care what others do!","474":"The jewish elite are using their status and power to control us! It's all a plot for Jews to take over the west.","475":"What makes you think that?","476":"There's lots of literature about it, look up the great replacement or the kalergi plan. All these theories point to Jews as the culprits.","477":"Those are baseless conspiracies. Yes, there's lots of literature on them but it's not reliable, it's just people theorising.","478":"But they make sense, there are many powerful Jews in high status positions in government, media, industry...","479":"Yes, but there are also many non-Jewish people in high powered positions. Yes, people do abuse positions of power, however this can happen whatever their religion or beliefs are, and definitely isn't because they're Jewish.","480":"Jews want us to submit to their agenda. They are intent on decimating the white race and corrupting Europe and the West.","481":"What agenda exactly?","482":"They are the reason we have mass migration, feminism, the lgbt agenda, it's all part of destroying white Europeans and their culture.","483":"Firstly, I don't think any of those things are corrosive to European culture (which isn't exclusively white). Secondly, to think there is some kind of plot to introduce those things to society is ludicrous. Things like feminism and lgbt rights are a reaction to the oppression of women and the lgbt community, and have nothing to do with Jewish people!","484":"Jews are so greedy, no wonder they're the ones in charge of all the banks.","485":"That's an anti-Semitic and outdated stereotype. There are high status bankers of all different religions and beliefs.","486":"I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy.","487":"Well it sounds like you haven't met many Jewish people at all then. Maybe if you knew more people from different cultures you would be more informed and wouldn't hold such stale stereotypes of them!","488":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","489":"Where have you drawn that link from? Also it seems a bit reductive to see immigration as 'mongrelising' society.","490":"The jews in power allow mass migration as part of their plan to take control over white countries. They know we're weaker with higher immigration from third world countries.","491":"I think you're making a massive leap, and I don't think there's any base to that claim. Also, immigration actually has positive effects on countries too. For example, filling labour shortages, people contributing to the economy, etc.","492":"Jews are the reason feminism is plaguing our country, destroying our traditional roles and families. They want to see our society decimated.","493":"What makes you link Jewish people and feminism? And why is feminism a bad thing in your view?","494":"It destroys our structures of gender roles, the nuclear family, everything our society has been built on, and what has kept it strong for so long. There's a lot of theories about why and how Jews did this. Look up the Great Replacement.","495":"I think feminism grew organically from women being dissatisfied, oppressed, and fed up. You might feel like those structures and roles kept society 'strong' for a long time but I'm pretty sure women these days are much happier than in the past. They have agency, choices, and aren't dependent on or ruled by men.","496":"When you look at the shocking job our government is doing, it makes a lot more sense when you realise it's filled with Jews.","497":"What is that supposed to mean?","498":"You can't trust them, they're greedy, and they just think about themselves.","499":"I think that's a sweeping and unfair generalisation. There are plenty of non-Jewish key players in the government who those words could apply to, so maybe it's not about religion or beliefs but about the corruption that money and power can bring?","500":"Jews love to play the victim. They still rinse the holocaust for pity even today, when it happened almost a century ago.","501":"Well the holocaust was horrific on a monumental scale, and it's effects are still felt today. I wouldn't say that's 'playing the victim', I'd say there's a legacy of anti-semitism left from it that we still have to address.","502":"That's rubbish, there isn't 'anti-semitism' today, this isn't Nazi Germany. They just want attention when they complain about being targeted and 'oppressed'.","503":"You are literally being anti-Semitic right now. If you need evidence that it exists today, read back your own tweets.","504":"Did the holocaust really happen? You can't trust Jews to give you an honest account of anything.","505":"Yes, there's plenty of evidence. Literal camps you can go and visit, 6 million people dead, leaving behind families and loved ones. How can you deny something that there's so much evidence of?","506":"It could all be set up. I don't know if I believe Auschwitz ever really happened.","507":"If you think the holocaust is all 'set up' you need to stop reading so many conspiracy theories and get a grip on reality. Not everything is a plot or a scheme, some things are real!","508":"Jews are the reason the lgbt agenda is gaining so much power in the West. They want to destroy our traditions and way of life.","509":"What do Jewish people have to do with the lgbt community? I don't see the link?","510":"It's part of their plan to decimate the white race and European culture. Look it up, there's lots of info about it, try googling the 'the great replacement'.","511":"The great replacement is a baseless conspiracy theory, I'm sure LGBT people gaining rights is more to do with fighting the oppression they have faced than with a 'scheme' by Jewish people!","512":"Look at the amount of migrants arriving in Dover this week, no wonder we spend so much money on benefits and hand outs, they're bankrupting us.","513":"Actually migrants and refugees arriving here aren't automatically eligible for benefits, if they're a refugee they can't claim benefits until they get leave to remain in the UK, which can take years. If they're not a refugee, they don't really have any access to provision at all.","514":"But what about the amount of them we are putting up in hotels, and all the asylum support we give them?","515":"Asylum support is less than \u00a340 a week, which is under a third of what a British person would get on a benefit like jobseekers allowance. It's hardly breaking the bank!","516":"Why are non-white countries allowed to exist but white countries aren\u2019t? We\u2019re constantly made to take in more and more black Africans.","517":"What do you mean by that? There are no countries that say \u2018no white people\u2019.","518":"Asian and African countries don\u2019t have to take the sort of mass migration that we do from their countries. This means there\u2019s less and less white people in the UK but their countries stay true to their ethnic heritage.","519":"I\u2019d object to the idea that the UK is a \u2018white country\u2019, people\u2019s nationality isn\u2019t defined by their skin colour. There are plenty of people who aren\u2019t white but are as British as anybody else here.","520":"Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians, why aren\u2019t we allowed to keep Britain for the British? We are erasing our white population, stop white genocide now.","521":"There is no white genocide happening in the UK, what makes you think that?","522":"Migration from black and brown countries is polluting our national ethnic heritage. We have to do something about it before white people are erased all together.","523":"If you see non-white people as \u2018polluting\u2019 the white race then you need to rethink how you see race. Skin colour has nothing to do with someone\u2019s national identity, and there\u2019s definitely not a genocide going on, just normal demographic change.","524":"So you admit there is demographic change happening? White people will be a minority by 2066.","525":"Yes, there\u2019s demographic change happening, but what I\u2019m saying is it\u2019s not a planned thing, it\u2019s not genocide, and it\u2019s not a bad, or good thing, it\u2019s just change. The UK population will be more diverse in the future, and that\u2019s fine!","526":"More crime, more stabbings, more rapes, and what's changed? We've got big black and Asian populations in our cities.","527":"I don't know if you can draw a direct correlation between those things, lots of things have changed in the last few decades that could affect crime rates.","528":"Oh yeah, like what? More ethnic 'minorities' is the biggest difference from 30-40 years ago to now. They're hardly the minority anymore.","529":"The wealth gap has widened massively in recent decades, this has meant more people in poverty who might have to turn to crime for some kind of income.","530":"There are some towns that are 'no go' areas for whites now because the Asian population is so big, this is meant to be the UK, not Pakistan!","531":"I don't think that's true, some newspapers have referred to these areas as 'no go' areas but there's nothing to suggest anything would happen if you as a white person went there.","532":"You don't know what they might do to you if they're not used to whites being on their turf.","533":"The only thing standing in your way of going to this areas is misplaced fear. Asian communities aren't violent or unwelcoming, they're just communities.","534":"All these blacks from Africa on our football teams but I don't see any English or European players on African teams. 'Enrichment' via diversity seems to be a one way street.","535":"Isn't that because these African players are great footballers, so have been scouted by UK teams because they want players of a high calibre?","536":"Maybe but why are they coming over here when there isn't the same happening the other way? Just seems like another way that we are told to be complacent about the growing black African population.","537":"You're complaining that our football teams scout international talent, just because they're black? I don't see the logic, how are you making this out like it's a bad thing, some players from African countries are great assets to UK teams.","538":"If white genocide isn't real then why do pictures of school classes look so different from the 70's vs now. Back then everyone was white except maybe 1 or 2, now there are 2-3 white children in a class of 30 blacks and arabs. We are being invaded.","539":"The demographic makeup of schools varies greatly depending on what area the school is in. Schools in cities and urban areas have more diverse classes, but lots of schools in towns and more rural areas are still overwhelmingly white. You can't generalise this to everywhere.","540":"But you can't deny there's been a big change in some places, whites are being wiped out, we need to fight back.","541":"Yes there's been changes in some areas but why is that a bad thing? It's not good or bad, demographic change is a neutral phenomenon. White people are hardly a minority in the UK, only in certain areas where other communities have grown, and that's not representative of most of the country.","542":"Went to Londanistan yesterday, not a white face in sight! Just asians and arabs everywhere, if we don't do something soon our culture is going to be erased. Forced multiculturalism has got to stop!","543":"Yeah London is very diverse, why do you feel like this is a bad thing?","544":"It's the capital of the UK, it should be a place where BRITISH culture thrives, not all these other cultures that we've let in and now are allowing to take over.","545":"I think it depends what you think of a British culture. I'm proud to say we live in a diverse country, and that immigration over 100s of years has shaped that culture. These cultures contribute to British culture, they don't detract from it!","546":"Diversity is ruining this country, erasing white culture, erasing white people. Diversity is a code word for white genocide.","547":"Just because the UK is diverse doesn't mean that white people are 'being erased'. What do you mean by that?","548":"Even the media encourages race mixing now, there's always families in adverts with white women, black men, and mixed children. Our genes are being erased.","549":"If you see people being in interracial relationships as a problem then you need to rethink how you're viewing the world. Someone's skin colour shouldn't matter to you this much. And I think you're exaggerating about the tv adverts, there's lots of white people on tv.","550":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","551":"Jeez, a bit extreme don't you think? Just because somebody's culture is different from yours it's no reason to call for violence. And don't think of other continents as the 'third world', just because you don't know much about these countries doesn't make them 'uncivilised' or 'undeveloped'. Educate yourself.","552":"Look how far the West has come while blacks in Africa are still living in mud huts. These people are savage and uncivilised.","553":"The development in the West was built on the backs of the millions of black slaves the West brutalised and abused. The West also pillaged these countries, taking their treasures and ownership of their natural resources, and you wonder why some countries are less economically developed. Also, the idea that Africa is just tribes living in huts is very ignorant, some African countries are extremely developed.","554":"Yet another stabbing in London, and the perpetrator is black, how surprising. Tell me again how diversity and multiculturalism are 'enriching'?","555":"What a tragic incident, but there's no reason to think the person's ethnicity had any bearing on why they committed this attack.","556":"It's always a black or Asian perpetrator though, they're obviously the problem.","557":"No it's not, knife crime has risen in the last few years amongst many different demographics. Teens from ethnic minorities are more likely to be vulnerable to joining gangs though, as they are more likely to live in deprived areas where gangs operate and recruit. This is more to do with poverty and lack of opportunity than it is to do with race.","558":"Everywhere you look now the media is encouraging race mixing and miscegenation. It's in our films and tv shows, in adverts. They want to mongrelise the white race and pollute our European heritage.","559":"Firstly, I don't think this is as widespread as you're proposing. Secondly, why would you have a problem if other people choose to be in interracial relationships? Who somebody else loves has no effect on your life.","560":"It's one of the many ways white people are being erased. First they replace us with mass migration, now they encourage mixing between the immigrant populations and white British people so there will be no white children. It's all part of their plan.","561":"It sounds like you think there's some sort of plot to replace white people, this really isn't the case. You've been reading too many conspiracy theories. I'd stop worrying things like this that aren't even problems if I were you, maybe you need to get a hobby.","562":"China isn't being turned non-Chinese, Japan isn't being turned non-Japanese, only WHITE countries are being made to become less white through forced migration and race mixing. This is WHITE GENOCIDE.","563":"No it's not, nothing about immigration happening is 'genocide'. You're conflating nationality with race. What exactly is a 'white country'?","564":"The UK and many European countries are being turned non-white when they are traditionally white populations, we are being encouraged to breed with non-whites to destroy there being a future for white people.","565":"The UK and many European countries enacted colonialism and literally kidnapped black people to bring them here as slaves. The UK not being 100% white isn't exactly a new phenomenon, colonisers literally pillaged and invaded other countries and brought people here against their will, of course we will have a diverse population today.","566":"Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white. The worst is white people who are anti-white. RACE TRAITORS!","567":"No anti-racist is a code word for... anti-racist. People concerned about racism aren't anti-white they are just calling attention to systematic injustices faced by ethnic minorities!","568":"There is no racism though, non-whites are so privileged now, if anything white people are the marginalised ones, we never get to play the race card.","569":"No, there's still huge inequality and discrimination. Black people are less likely to be considered for jobs with the same CV but 'African sounding names', more likely to be stopped and searched by the Police, more likely to be in poverty. There's lots of inequalities we need to address which have deep historic and cultural roots.","570":"The great replacement is real and it's happening right before our eyes. We need to act before it's too late.","571":"No, the great replacement is a conspiracy theory. There's no truth in the idea that demographic change is some kind of plan being orchestrated by the 'elite'.","572":"It's happening though, more 'diversity' means there are less whites and more arabs and blacks in our countries.","573":"Yes some demographic change is happening but this is because of various global social and economic forces and isn't part of some kind of secret plot. It's also not a good or bad thing, it's just something that happens.","574":"One downside to the race mixing that is encouraged in our society nowadays is the effect that black and arab genes will have on children's IQs. A mongrelised population is one that is stupid and easy to control.","575":"What are you talking about? There's no evidence to say that black people, or people from the Middle East have lower IQs. Also, IQ is a very outdated measure of intelligence and isn't widely supported as a measure of this now.","576":"If blacks don't have lower IQs then why is Africa such a shithole?","577":"You need to educate yourself about African countries if you think they are 'shitholes', and if by that you mean they're not as economically developed, that's probably because all of their natural resources were pillaged and taken into ownership by European colonisers...","578":"We\u2019ve got so many Muslims in our country that some places are now no go areas for white people, when are people going to realise this is an invasion?","579":"\u2018No go areas\u2019 is just a title that was given to these areas by some tabloid papers, they\u2019re not actually unsafe for non-Muslims, they just have a large Muslim population that\u2019s all!","580":"We can\u2019t be complacent when they\u2019re taking over whole areas and towns, they\u2019re trying to take over.","581":"No, it just makes sense to live close to others in your community, part of the reason that Muslim populations are concentrated in certain areas is probably a reaction to the Islamophobia faced in areas where they are the minority.","582":"So you\u2019re not denying they\u2019re taking over towns?","583":"No I\u2019m saying there will naturally be some places that have concentrated Muslim populations, but this doesn\u2019t mean they are \u2018taking over\u2019, and there are only a few of these towns, they\u2019re not representative of most places in the country.","584":"Muslims want to impose sharia law on our country, we need to show them it\u2019s not welcome!","585":"No they don\u2019t, they may follow sharia themselves but the vast majority of Muslims don\u2019t care about imposing their beliefs on others!","586":"But what about all the halal meat in supermarkets now? That\u2019s creeping sharia\u2026","587":"I hardly think halal meat being more widely available equates to sharia law being enforced, it just means that supermarkets are stocking food that is in demand in certain communities.","588":"Why isn\u2019t the burqa banned in this country? It\u2019s just a symbol of the oppressive force of Islam.","589":"Because in this country people are free to wear and believe in whatever they want. Many Muslim women choose to wear the burqa as a personal choice, they\u2019re not forced to.","590":"The Taliban are forcing women to wear the burqa and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s not oppressive?","591":"But here we are not under the control of the Taliban. Yes, in that context it is forced, and some might feel pressure to wear it, but we also need to respect the choice of the women here who want to wear it of their own accord.","592":"Halal slaughter is a barbaric and cruel practice and should be banned! Why does the meat industry pander to the whims of Islamists?","593":"If you\u2019re against halal slaughter I assume you\u2019re against all animal cruelty and slaughter?","594":"No halal is extremely cruel, if we just slaughtered animals in the ways we usually do, with stunning, it would be much kinder, but halal meat is everywhere now because of the influence of Islam.","595":"If you\u2019re against halal meat but not against the cruelty in non-halal slaughter (animals being abused by workers, being kept in squalid conditions etc) then I think it sounds like your problem is with Islam, not with the meat industry.","596":"Muslims want to make it mandatory for women to wear the burqa! They don\u2019t respect our way of life.","597":"No, Muslims don\u2019t care what other people are doing, they just want to be able to follow their religion in peace, where did you hear that?","598":"There are loads of articles about it, they want to enforce sharia everywhere.","599":"I question how reliable those articles are, make sure you fact check things like this before repeating it!","600":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","601":"No, Muslims want to be able to eat halal, but they don\u2019t care if everyone eats it. What makes you think that?","602":"It\u2019s everywhere now, in all the supermarkets, they\u2019re forcing their beliefs into our food now.","603":"Just because halal meat is widely available doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s being forced on anyone, there\u2019s just demand for it!","604":"More and more mosques being built whilst churches are being burnt down all over Europe. This is the start of Islamification.","605":"There\u2019s no link between mosques being built and churches being vandalised, why are you trying to make one?","606":"Yes there is, it\u2019s probably Muslims who are doing the damage, they want to replace us.","607":"I don\u2019t think \u2018probably\u2019 is very good logic, you can\u2019t just assume these things, churches get vandalised by all sorts of people, not necessarily Muslims.","608":"So you think it\u2019s a coincidence that so many churches have been burnt down in the last few years?","609":"Yes, and whilst there\u2019s been some articles about how many churches have been vandalised, I think it\u2019s important to point out a lot of the churches counted have not been burnt down, some incidents were as small as graffiti.","610":"Everywhere you look now there\u2019s shops with Asian names, halal butchers, Indian clothes shops, this isn\u2019t Afghanistan!! Time to take our country back from these musrats","611":"So you\u2019re angry that Muslims and the Asian population are starting businesses and contributing to the economy?","612":"Well they\u2019re not businesses I\u2019ll be using, I don\u2019t support the replacement of our people and culture.","613":"This isn\u2019t replacement, there\u2019s just demand for these shops in the areas they\u2019re in. And you do benefit from them, these business owners pay taxes and contribute to our economy.","614":"These Muslims come over here with their 3 wives and 10 kids then sponge off our government and get huge council houses. How is this fair??","615":"This isn\u2019t true, sure some people have big families and some people require state support but you can\u2019t generalise this to all Muslims.","616":"When they come here from Muslims countries they seem to skip to the front of the queue and get these massive houses, I\u2019ve been waiting for a house from the council for years and I\u2019m still waiting!","617":"Yes, there\u2019s a shortage of social housing in this country which is a big problem and something we need to sort out, but this isn\u2019t the fault of Muslims and even though it might seem that way, they don\u2019t get any special privileges!","618":"We\u2019ve got homeless veterans who\u2019ve fought for our country sleeping on the streets whilst these Afghans get put up in hotels then given a house, how is this fair?","619":"Yes, our homelessness problem is terrible and no one deserves to be sleeping on the streets, but asylum seekers are not the reason this problem exists. The government could house homeless veterans too, but chooses not to!","620":"Well that\u2019s disgusting, they deserve a roof over their head way more than some Afghan or African who\u2019s just washed up here in a dinghy.","621":"They both deserve a roof over their head, we have over 600,000 empty homes in this country which are not being used to house people, maybe it\u2019s time we invested in social housing again?","622":"Asylum seekers are sat on their arses getting benefits whilst I go out working for minimum wage everyday. How is this fair?","623":"It\u2019s illegal for asylum seekers to work. Most of them want to, but they could risk their application for asylum being rejected if they break the law by doing so!","624":"Well why do they get benefits when they\u2019re waiting for a decision?","625":"Asylum support isn\u2019t very much at all, just under \u00a340 per week, it\u2019s barely enough for basic essentials so they\u2019re hardly living in luxury.","626":"Okay but why do we owe them anything? \u00a340 might not be a lot but there\u2019s thousands of them coming here.","627":"They\u2019re seeking asylum, which means they\u2019re likely very vulnerable. If they need to seek refuge here, the least we can do is treat them with dignity and respect because they\u2019re human beings.","628":"We need to send a clear message","629":"No we\u2019re not. There are over 600,000 empty houses in this country, and vast amounts of land that haven\u2019t been built on. We\u2019re not full.","630":"But our economy and infrastructure can\u2019t support all these migrants, they\u2019re rinsing our benefit system and making it harder for us to get jobs.","631":"Are they on benefits or are they stealing jobs? Make up your mind, it can\u2019t be both!","632":"Just read about a family of Afghans who came over here and got given a \u00a31 million council house because they\u2019ve got such a big family. Fuming.","633":"That sounds like fake news, where did you see that?","634":"There\u2019s an article on this website about it...","635":"Have you seen it reported anywhere else? I wouldn\u2019t trust it coming from a site like that, sounds like a story that\u2019s been made up to fuel hate towards migrants.","636":"Migrants just want to come here to exploit our nhs, when it\u2019s already struggling as it is. We cannot keep supporting health tourism!","637":"Actually health tourism is responsible for a minuscule amount of the NHS budget, maybe the problem is actually the underfunding of the healthcare system?","638":"The NHS is on its knees, it\u2019s not fit for purpose anymore, and we don\u2019t need all these foreigners coming over here for free healthcare!","639":"The NHS needs to be better funded, it\u2019s fit for purpose but needs more resources. Health tourism is a tiny problem that gets exaggerated in the media!","640":"The hoards of migrants that are coming here are a threat to girls in our country, migrant rape is an EPIDEMIC","641":"Sexual assault is a big problem that we need to do more to address, but I don't think this is an issue that's solely caused by migrants?","642":"Have you not see then headlines across Europe about girls being gangraped in cities in Germany, Sweden, Italy, it's happening everywhere!","643":"Yes these incidents are horrific, but they are in the news because they are exceptionally bad cases. Sexual assault is most likely to be committed in the home by someone known to the victim. This means it's not very likely to be someone they don't know, like a street attack by a migrant.","644":"These migrants are SCUM, they're too uncivilised for our society and they don't even try and integrate into our culture.","645":"I'm sure lots of migrants want to be better integrated but it's difficult when they don't know anyone who can help them to get to grips with living in a new country. It can be very isolating moving here!","646":"If they're not going to integrate though why come here at all? They should stay in the shitholes they came from.","647":"They want to integrate but having attitudes towards migrants like yours makes for a hostile environment. Maybe if we were nicer to migrants and didn't talk about them in this way integration would be easier?","648":"Migrants are a menace to our society, look at the link between mass migration and crime rates going up. There's more stabbings, more assaults, and you can guess who's doing it...","649":"What exactly is the link between higher migration and crime rates? I haven't seen anything to suggest the two things are linked.","650":"We've started accepting swathes of migrants in the last few decades and there's loads more crime than there used to be 30\/40 years ago.","651":"Okay but lots of things have changed in the last few decades, I don't think you can link crime to migration specifically. The economy has changed, inequalities have got worse, the population has also grown outside of migration, and the ways we report and record crime have evolved. These are all factors.","652":"Yet another war memorial vandalised, and I think we can guess who's behind it. These migrant scum have no respect for our history and culture.","653":"That's a big assumption, how do you know it's migrants? It could have been anyone.","654":"It always is, whenever this happens. They're too uncivilised to respect our war heroes.","655":"I think your assumption is unfair. Vandalism is done by all sorts of people, usually teenagers or sometimes rowdy drunk people after a night out, you can't assume it's migrants with no evidence.","656":"You never used to hear about stabbings happening as much as they do now. It's all these migrants bringing a culture of violence to our country.","657":"There are a lot of stabbings, yes, but they're not all committed by migrants? Where is the evidence to suggest that?","658":"A lot of the incidents are in the capital, where there's a big migrant population. You're telling me you don't think there's a link there?","659":"There's more migrants yes but there's also more wealth inequality there, deprived inner city communities where gangs operate and young people don't have many opportunities. Maybe that has more to do with it than migrants?","660":"Maybe but some of the people in those gangs will be migrants.","661":"Yes sure some will, and some won't, but the point is that the stabbings aren't happening because there are migrants in some gangs, the stabbings are happenings because of gangs which people are forced to join because of wealth inequality, poverty, lack of opportunities etc.","662":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","663":"I'm sorry to hear you don't feel safe in your local area anymore but what does migrants moving to the area have to do with that?","664":"They're going to bring more crime with them, and they're just changing things. You walk down the street now and people are speaking every language except english.","665":"I understand your concern but I think if you got to know them you'd see migrants aren't a threat. Maybe they have a different culture or language but please don't let that make you feel unsafe, it's just unfamiliar!","666":"Mass migration is turning our inner cities into ghettos! These people add nothing to our communities.","667":"What do you mean by that? Migrants are more likely to be business owners and create jobs than the native population, that\u2019s good for our communities!","668":"The neighbourhoods they live in always get run down, vandalised, have no investment and are dangerous.","669":"Maybe that has more to do with those areas being poorer areas that don't receive as much investment from the council, and have less youth services? Migrants are more likely to live in poverty, so are more likely to live in neighbourhoods like this.","670":"Another machete attack. Both suspects were of immigrant descent. Is this what liberals call cultural enrichment?","671":"We all know violent crime and knife crime is increasing across communities. This is a terrible criminal act but we also know those criminals do not represent a whole community.","672":"So you just want to ignore that it's another attack by immigrants? These people are a danger to our country.","673":"I'm not ignoring it, just saying that not all violent incidents are committed by migrants, and these people are not representative of migrants as a whole. The majority of people who migrate here don't commit crimes like this.","674":"Another child gang raped by savage migrants. Multiculturalism has failed.","675":"Sexual assault is always shocking and children need to be protected from abuse but why is the nationality of the perpetrators relevant unless you're only sharing this news to push a narrative?","676":"And what narrative would that be? I'm taking a stand against what these scumbags are doing to our children and girls.","677":"If you're passionate about stopping child abuse and sexual abuse that's great, but that means tackling all abuse, not just when it's committed by people of a specific nationality.","678":"But they're the reason we have a rape epidemic in Europe.","679":"No, some incidents are committed by migrants, but this isn't disproportionate to the amount of incidents committed by native citizens. Also, we can never know the true scale of sexual abuse because most victims don't report it. This means what you see in the media about this is skewed to what is 'sensationalist', like headlines about migrants.","680":"Calling criminals entering our country 'undocumented migrants' is a little bit like calling drugs 'undocumented drugs'. Just avoids using the words illegal and smugglers.","681":"They are people nonetheless, and many are coming here to seek asylum because they are fleeing war or persecution. This isn't illegal.","682":"They are illegal! They have to seek refuge in the first safe country they set foot in, so why are they all the way over on this side of Europe when they've come from the middle east?","683":"No, that's false. The 1951 refugee convention states that they can seek asylum in any country, not the first they pass through. Also many refugees do stay in the first country they get to, that's why Turkey has such a high refugee population. Some just travel further because those neighbouring countries can't take everybody.","684":"Women have every right to *protect* their rights from pro-trans activists. No-one has the right to call them 'TERFS' for doing so. Only women have vaginas. Only men have penises. Only women have periods. These are indisputable facts.","685":"You're completely ignoring the distinction between sex and gender. People of the female sex have a female reproductive system, but gender is about how you feel, how you identify, gender has nothing to do with your reproductive organs.","686":"All you have done is to redefine the words sex and gender to suit your preferred narrative. Feelings are a separate issue.","687":"And how do you define the words sex and gender? They are two distinct concepts, not synonyms of each other.","688":"You are entitled to your opinion of course, but your comments are not factual, merely your opinion. Trans activism is warping your idea of gender...","689":"Literally google the definition of gender as opposed to sex, I'm begging you educate yourself.","690":"Terms like 'non-binary' are modern, attention-seeking, & anti-scientific. They want to erase the reality that women are women and men are men, to undermine the rights of REAL women.","691":"Non-binary might be a relatively new word in the public lexicon but people who don't fit into either male or female binary gender have always existed. It's not anti-scientific, it regards gender not sex.","692":"A man can dress up as a woman but he'll always be a man. What is the point of 'non-binary' anyway? What does it even mean? People think they can call anything a new 'gender' nowadays.","693":"Non-binary means existing outside of the gender binary. For some people this means feeling feminine and masculine, sometimes one more than the other. For other people it means not feeling gendered, not identifying with either being a man or a woman. When you see gender as a social construct that encompasses femininity and masculinity this makes a lot more sense.","694":"That sounds like some woke bullshit, you can't just decide that you want to be a different gender everyday. Gender isn't a social construct, it's very real, we have men and women and that's it.","695":"Gender is very much a social construct, if you look up the definition of gender it means the social and cultural roles associated with being a man or woman. It doesn't have to align with your biological sex, and because it's just a concept some people like non-binary people do not feel the need to put themselves in a box of masculine or feminine with it!","696":"The trans agenda want to ignore the biological reality of being a woman. You can't just call yourself a woman and expect everyone to believe you are one when you are clearly a man! It's PC gone mad.","697":"There is a difference between sex and gender. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, some people know they are a woman, do not feel like they are a man in anyway, but don't have a female reproductive system. This is the difference between gender and sex, gender is who you feel you are, sex is just the biological aspect, and they don't always match up.","698":"That's bollocks. So biological facts are only valid depending on how you 'feel'? How do you know if you 'feel' like a woman?","699":"Well do you feel like you are a woman, biology aside? Do you feel like being a woman is part of your identity and that it shapes how you interact with society and think about yourself?","700":"Yes because I am a woman, biologically female.","701":"Okay so imagine still feeling like that, identity-wise, but in a different body. That's it. That's all you've got to understand.","702":"The trans militia say they're fighting for 'rights' but then insist on pushing ideas that make women unsafe, like allowing men to use women's toilets without question. What is this madness and why are we accepting it??","703":"Nobody is asking for that. The point people are making is that trans women should be able to feel safe using womens toilets because they are in fact women. If they were to use mens toilets they would be put in an unsafe situation.","704":"But how many of these 'trans women' are just men dressed as women who are pretending to be trans to gain access to spaces like womens toilets and assault women?","705":"None because if they're trans women, they are trans women, not men. If men wanted to gain access to womens spaces to assault women they would just do that, they wouldn't pretend to be a trans woman to do so, since anyone can walk into any toilet.","706":"Trans women being allowed to use women's shelters just sounds like a way to justify letting the men who abuse women into their spaces to abuse them again.","707":"That's not what it means at all. The trans women who would use womens shelter services are women who will have faced abuse of some kind, just like the other women there.","708":"How do we know none of them will be abusive once they're in there though?","709":"How do you know if anybody in a shelter will be abusive to anyone else in there? Them being trans has no bearing on the issue, since they're not men, they're trans women. Trans women are also very likely to face abuse or violence in their lifetime so it's important they have services they can access for support.","710":"They want us to believe that tricking kids into thinking they're transgender is normal. That giving kids hormones that permanently mess with their development is normal. We can't let this happen right before our eyes.","711":"No one is forcing kids to transition, if a child feels like they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is not a decision ever taken lightly, and it's a long and stressful process involving consultation from many medical and psychological professionals.","712":"Why are so many more kids transitioning then than they used to? It used to be a small minority and now it's too many kids. Some are being coerced.","713":"No, it's just more accessible now, and we talk about gender more openly. There have always been people who have felt like they're in the wrong body or are a gender that's different than their sex, but many have only been able to come out much later in life or sometimes never, because of transphobia and the violence that comes with it.","714":"The trans agenda are anti-science, they don\u2019t listen to logic and facts. Ignoring the biological reality of sex is pure delusion.","715":"There is no \u2018agenda\u2019, and they are not \u2018anti-science\u2019, they just understand the difference between sex and gender.","716":"Their agenda is being pushed on us through the media and cancelling anyone who criticises them. And they can\u2019t seem to grasp that there\u2019s just 2 sexes.","717":"Mainstream media is actually filled with stories which normalise seeing trans peoples existence as something to debate. It\u2019s not up for debate, they exist.","718":"They might exist but they are delusional and seem to make up new genders every day. There are men and women and that\u2019s it.","719":"Gender is a social construct so it can be a broad spectrum, and sex isn\u2019t as binary as many people believe either, for example there are intersex people and people with different hormone levels or reproductive organs.","720":"How are our people meant to get jobs when migrants are coming here and depressing wages by taking on jobs for less than minimum wage?","721":"This does happen but are the migrants to blame? Maybe we need to turn our focus to the employers who are exploiting people to make more profit for themselves.","722":"True, but often the employers are migrants too in the sort of industries these jobs are in.","723":"That\u2019s a big assumption to make, there are plenty of non-migrant employers who do this too.","724":"Another mosque smashed up. I\u2019m beginning to wonder whether the fact we have had diversity and multiculturalism forced on us without our consent has anything to do with this?","725":"So you\u2019re blaming this hate crime on the fact that Muslims... exist?","726":"Making us accept multiculturalism without our consent has made people angry, they are taking out their frustration.","727":"I don\u2019t know what you mean by \u2018without our consent\u2019 because multiculturalism is a broad and vague concept, not one policy the government could ask people about. But still, no one deserves to be targeted like this, everyone should feel safe in their own community and place of worship.","728":"Just seen another story about a woman being asked to cover up. Soon we are all going to be forced to wear a hijab, other clothes will be considered offensive and inappropriate.","729":"There\u2019s nothing to suggest she was asked to cover up by a Muslim. Stop co-opting news stories unrelated to Islam to fuel your fearmongering.","730":"I think that assuming it was a Muslim isn\u2019t such a wild thing to assume. They\u2019d have us all in burqas if they could.","731":"No they wouldn\u2019t. Muslims just want to be able to wear what they want, in line with what they believe or feel comfortable in, they don\u2019t care what anyone else is wearing!","732":"Most people don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on in mosques across this country. It\u2019s diabolical that they are not regulated, they\u2019re just free to do as they please.","733":"What regulation would you suggest? And for what reason?","734":"They\u2019re not allowed to take sniffer dogs in there, who knows what could be being plotted in some of the more extreme ones.","735":"It\u2019s a bit of an unfair generalisation to suggest criminal or terrorist activity is being planned in lots of mosques. Yes, there have been instances of this, but to put all mosques under surveillance is unnecessary and hostile.","736":"So you\u2019d rather they are allowed to plot the next big terror attack undisturbed?","737":"No, I\u2019m just saying there is extremism in all religions and ideologies, to only check mosques for this is discriminatory. The vast majority of Muslims condemn this activity too.","738":"Just seen that Muslims are banning people from walking dogs in Muslim areas, this is ridiculous! They hate our culture, even our pets.","739":"That sounds fake, where did you see this? I\u2019m sure they really don\u2019t care.","740":"There\u2019s an article about it on this site. Dogs are haram in Islam, they want to take away our pets!","741":"There is another website that explains that this was a hoax, no Muslims ever said this, it was intended to stir up hate against Muslims! It seems like it has worked unfortunately.","742":"They want white Europeans to feel guilty for climate change whilst ignoring the fact that Asians and Africans are responsible for over 90% of the pollution in our oceans.","743":"Do you mean to plastic pollution that Western countries export to them? We literally send our rubbish to those countries to lie in scrap heaps.","744":"Not just that though, their manufacturing industry churns out co2 and chemicals. Factories in China are a big contributor, but it\u2019s Europeans who are told to change their lifestyles.","745":"That\u2019s because most of those factories are manufacturing goods to be sold here in Europe. We live in a global economy, and we are all responsible for cutting emissions but Europeans consume a lot more than the average citizen in African and Asian nations.","746":"Allowing children at Pride parades is sick. It\u2019s just another way to indoctrinate them into this perverse lifestyle.","747":"I think it\u2019s nice that more parents are open minded now. Taking kids to pride is a great way to let them know they will still be loved and accepted if they do ever realise they are queer.","748":"They wouldn\u2019t be thinking they were gay if they weren\u2019t exposed to this stuff! It\u2019s damaging.","749":"That\u2019s obviously not how sexuality works. Look at the amount of LGBT+ people who come from backgrounds where they weren\u2019t allowed to be gay. If someone is gay that has nothing to do with what they\u2019ve been \u2018exposed\u2019 to!","750":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","751":"Kids in drag doesn\u2019t equate to the lgbt community sexualising children. Why did you make that link?","752":"Drag is very sexual, you\u2019ve got boys wearing heels and makeup, it\u2019s bound to mess with them.","753":"If there are kids in drag at pride it\u2019s probably because they wanted to dress up. Kids playing dress up is nothing new, and isn\u2019t sexual!","754":"Allowing kids to go to pride is the start of them being pushed down the trans pipeline.","755":"What do you mean by the \u2018trans pipeline\u2019?","756":"They indoctrinate these kids into thinking they are trans by showing them drag queens and making them think men dressing up as women is normal.","757":"I don\u2019t think a child attending pride with their family is going to make them trans, that\u2019s a big leap to make. By that logic, they\u2019re exposed to lots of non-trans people so that should influence them not to!","758":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","759":"There\u2019s still lots of Islamophobia. You only have to look at the news to see the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen, targeting Muslims.","760":"Okay but there\u2019s also lots of attacks by Muslims. Lots of them don\u2019t reach the papers, I wonder why...","761":"On the contrary I see a lot of news about attacks by Muslims, because the media disproportionately reports these attacks, and makes a point of announcing the suspects religion. I never see them do this when the attacker is a Christian or an atheist. I wonder why...","762":"Muslims should be made to assimilate or be deported! They don\u2019t recognise man made laws, they will only follow their prophets teachings.","763":"No they shouldn\u2019t. Part of sharia law is to respect the law of the land you\u2019re in, so Muslims do follow the law. Also, many Muslims are British citizens, where would they be deported to?","764":"They should be deported back to whatever Islamic country they\u2019re really from.","765":"They\u2019re British so they\u2019re \u2018really\u2019 from the UK. Where do you deport a British citizen to?","766":"Population of India","767":"This is such a silly argument to make. Obviously somebody who is Indian wouldn\u2019t be an ethnic minority in India. That has no bearing on how many people from India are in the UK.","768":"But there\u2019s so many of them, if even a small percentage come here there could be more brown faces than white and we would become a minority.","769":"Okay but white people are still very much the majority in the UK so that\u2019s not happening, so what point are you trying to make?","770":"Jews across the world know the aims of Zionists are world dominance and controlling the worlds resources. These aims cannot be achieved without eliminating all other religions through spreading atheism and liberalism.","771":"This isn\u2019t true and being Jewish is not the same as being a Zionist! What makes you think there is any plot for \u2018world dominance\u2019?","772":"That\u2019s the aim of Zionism, Jewish dominance.","773":"Zionists believe in there being a Jewish homeland, not in \u2018Jewish dominance\u2019. Not all Jewish people are Zionists though, so don\u2019t conflate the two.","774":"Why wouldn\u2019t all Jews be Zionists? Surely any religion wants to grow, spread, dominate.","775":"By that logic are Christians, Muslims, Hindus etc all looking to dominate the world too? No. Jewish people just want to be able to live without facing anti-semitism.","776":"Mosques being vandalised, churches being burned down, Muslims and Christians are blaming each other. I wonder what group would want to turn the goyim against each other\u2026","777":"If you\u2019re insinuating Jewish people are behind these attacks, that\u2019s a big assumption to make without any evidence.","778":"They always are. They\u2019ve been trying to stir up unrest between Muslims and Christians for centuries.","779":"Mosques and churches could be vandalised by anyone, it could be teenagers messing around or in more serious incidents, it could be a hate crime. To ascribe all of this to Jewish people seems unfair and unevidenced.","780":"It\u2019s typical Jew behaviour. They always cause trouble then manage to avoid the blame.","781":"You need to open your mind up to other explanations. Thinking everything is part of a conspiracy or some kind of contrived plot isn\u2019t a healthy or rational way to think. A lot of these incidents are random and isolated, it\u2019s not all some big Jewish conspiracy.","782":"Problems caused by Jews","783":"Besides how ridiculous this statement is, it\u2019s also just implausible. How could Jews do ALL this at once? That\u2019s a lot of plotting to do, they\u2019d be run ragged! Next time you want to start a conspiracy theory, make it more believable\u2026","784":"You can discredit it by calling it a conspiracy theory but we all know it\u2019s the truth. They\u2019re in charge of everything, they\u2019ve got the power and control to make this happen.","785":"Just because there are some powerful Jewish people doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re all conspiring together with other powerful Jewish people to cause these world issues. There are plenty of powerful people who aren\u2019t Jewish, it has nothing to do with faith!","786":"Zionists, neo-con, money changers, deepstate, they have many names but they are the same NWO globalist cabal.","787":"Do you really believe there is a \u2018globalist cabal\u2019 controlling us? And if so, what do you think they\u2019re doing?","788":"How could you not believe it, the evidence is everywhere. They want to use their power to make us goyim into an enslaved population whilst they hoard their wealth.","789":"It sounds like you\u2019ve spent a bit too long on the internet reading conspiracy theories. Have you considered other explanations for the things you think they\u2019re doing?","790":"Like what?","791":"Power and corruption do go hand in hand, but from the language you\u2019re using, why are you assuming this is a Jewish plot? Yes the wealthy do unethical things to enable them to hoard wealth but this can apply to wealthy people of any faith, not just Jews.","792":"Everywhere you turn there is a holocaust survivor. Who the hell did this man called Hitler actually kill? #holohoax","793":"Where did you get that idea? The reason it\u2019s sometimes publicised when a holocaust survivor speaks about their experience is because there aren\u2019t many of them, especially now when most survivors have passed away.","794":"When they talk about it in the press it just makes the whole thing even less believable, seems like they\u2019re just saying it happened for the attention and money.","795":"Do you not believe the holocaust happened?","796":"There\u2019s a lot that doesn\u2019t add up about it, and we can\u2019t trust the accounts of a few old Jews who happened to be alive at the time.","797":"There is an overwhelming amount of evidence that the holocaust happened. There are concentration camps. There are millions of families who lost almost every member. The Jewish population in Europe declined drastically. Have you looked at any of this evidence?","798":"How do we know that evidence isn\u2019t planted? Of course they want us to think it happened, they have to keep up the narrative. There are too many inconsistencies.","799":"How do you know the evidence of \u2018inconsistencies\u2019 that you believe wasn\u2019t planted, or that that information wasn\u2019t spread to support a narrative instead of the truth? It sounds like a much more likely explanation than Jews building fake concentration camps and millions just disappearing.","800":"Hitler was a Jew, I think the holocaust or it\u2019s results came from a civil war amongst Jews. Thus the term \u2018Nazi\u2019 coming from AshkeNAZI.","801":"No he wasn\u2019t. Where did you see that?","802":"It\u2019s not widely known but there\u2019s info out there about it if you look for it. He had some Jewish heritage so the whole holocaust thing seems implausible.","803":"That\u2019s objectively not true. There was speculation that one of Hitler\u2019s relatives could have had a Jewish father but this was never proven. Why do you trust whatever you\u2019ve read that said Hitler was Jewish over the 1000\u2019s of pieces of evidence that he wasn\u2019t, and instead orchestrated the holocaust?","804":"You can\u2019t take \u2018evidence\u2019 at face value. Whatever they feed us about the holocaust, we need to take with a pinch of salt.","805":"Yes, you can\u2019t take things at face value. For example, if you read that Hitler was Jewish, I wouldn\u2019t take that at face value. If you\u2019re going to question how reliable evidence is, that\u2019s good critical thinking, but you have to question the \u2018evidence\u2019 you believe too!","806":"Our nation is at the mercy of a Zionist led criminal system. It controls the government and the courts and at it\u2019s helm are the criminal bankers in control of our economy. It feeds their greed!","807":"Yes, there\u2019s corruption in government, banking etc but what has this got to do with Zionists?","808":"They\u2019ve got Jews in charge of every major institution, if you don\u2019t think corruption has anything to do with Jewish power then you\u2019re deluded.","809":"There are powerful people who do corrupt or criminal things. There are powerful people who are Jewish. My point is that powerful people who are corrupt do not do these things BECAUSE they are Jewish. It\u2019s also that corruption is not exclusive to Jewish people in power.","810":"If they\u2019re not doing it to support the Zionist agenda what do you think the reason is?","811":"Money and power obviously? Isn\u2019t that the point of all corruption? They don\u2019t need another agenda on top of those things, there\u2019s enough reason to be corrupt right there.","812":"Anyone who\u2019s done their research knows the Jews did 9\/11.","813":"Sounds like a conspiracy theory to me, where\u2019s the evidence?","814":"There\u2019s plenty of explanations for it, just google it. They all involve Jews, and it makes sense given what they\u2019ve gone on to do to the West over the last two decades.","815":"If there\u2019s plenty of explanations and they ALL involve Jews then which explanation is the truth and which are conspiracy theories? Couldn\u2019t they all just be speculation?","816":"They could but it seems likely given what the globalist cabal has been doing in the last few years.","817":"And what exactly is it that they have been doing?","818":"Forcing mass migration on us, staging financial crises and pandemics. They want control over us and it\u2019s working.","819":"It's too simplistic to just blame all the worlds issues on some conceptual \u2018globalist cabal\u2019. Maybe financial crises and pandemics, and people being displaced and having to migrate are issues caused by many factors, not just part of a \u2018plot\u2019!","820":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","821":"Why is it insulting?","822":"We built civilisation as we know it, and they want to destroy our culture and everything we\u2019ve achieved.","823":"I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct. Lots of Jewish people also contributed to building our society, along with people from other religious groups and people who aren\u2019t white. What you\u2019re saying is a bit oversimplified and inaccurate.","824":"It sounds like you\u2019re on their side, why do you hate what whites have achieved?","825":"I\u2019m not on any \u2018side\u2019 I\u2019m just saying that civilisation is not the product of one race\u2019s achievements, it\u2019s comprised of efforts from many different groups. I also don\u2019t agree with what you\u2019re saying about Jews wanting to \u2018destroy\u2019 this, why would they?","826":"They hate what the West used to be, now they want to impurify our race by encouraging mass migration to taint our culture and ruin our countries.","827":"Migration is not necessarily a bad thing, and whatever you think about it, believing that Jewish people are somehow encouraging it or are responsible for it seems like a wild leap to make. Migration happens for lots of reasons, Jewish people are not one of them.","828":"These gangs of muzrats are a danger to our children. Grooming is a part of their culture!","829":"Actually a study of grooming gangs in the UK found that most were made up of white men in their 20's and 30's, not people from Asian or Muslim backgrounds.","830":"How come the only grooming gangs we ever hear about are all Muslims then?","831":"Maybe that has more to do with what media you consume than with who is in grooming gangs? If you read publications that are biased against Muslims, of course they're going to report on crime when it's committed by them, and less when it's not.","832":"Way too many bitches are comfortable dressing like ugly hoes for IG likes and reposts\u2026","833":"What does the way someone else dresses have to do with you?","834":"I\u2019m just saying these bitches look ugly af and they\u2019re just doing it for the likes, it\u2019s not attractive.","835":"If it\u2019s not attractive, what made you think these women were trying to attract anyone anyway? Women aren\u2019t trying to be attractive 24\/7, sometimes they\u2019re just trying to live their lives.","836":"But they\u2019re putting it all over social media, why would they do that if they weren\u2019t trying to attract\u2026","837":"Maybe because they\u2019re expressing themselves, or because they liked how they looked and wanted to share it, regardless of if men would like it too? Stop expecting women to cater to the male gaze.","838":"You still can\u2019t turn a hoe into a housewife!","839":"If you think of women as only hoes or housewives instead of as people, then no wonder no one wants to be your wife!","840":"Bitches these days aren\u2019t housewife material, they just wanna be out partying, being a hoe.","841":"Good for them! With the way you talk about women, I\u2019d take going out partying and being independent over being with a man who thinks of me like that any day!","842":"Why you so offended by my opinions about these hoes?","843":"Because you\u2019re thinking of women as just playing a role, they can either be a \u2018hoe\u2019 or a housewife in your mind, but in reality women are complex human beings, and they\u2019re not here just to play a role in your life. It sounds like you can\u2019t accept that some women would rather be independent and be a \u2018hoe\u2019 than settle for men who don\u2019t think of them as equals.","844":"Two things I could never respect","845":"Why could you never respect a feminist?","846":"They say they want equality but they\u2019re just bitter and they hate men, probably cause no men are paying them attention.","847":"You seem confused or miseducated, feminism isn\u2019t about that at all. It\u2019s not about \u2018hating men\u2019, it\u2019s about recognising that we live in a patriarchal society and working to change that.","848":"Men are natural born leaders, they\u2019re fucking with the natural order of the world, if they can\u2019t accept that women need men to take charge, that\u2019s their problem.","849":"If that\u2019s the way you think then I hope you see sense some day! There are plenty of strong, confident, and independent women in the world proving that they can lead and take charge. Being a leader is not a gendered role.","850":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","851":"Sure, an arrangement like that works for some people, but not for everyone. Maybe we put too much pressure on men and women to fit into these strict gender roles?","852":"When you start switching it up and women are earning more than their man, that\u2019s embarrassing for the man. He isn\u2019t gonna want to stay in a relationship like that.","853":"If you think that women earning good money is emasculating for men, maybe your idea of masculinity is quite fragile? Masculinity has nothing to do with if you\u2019re the breadwinner in a relationship.","854":"Providing is a mans role and you\u2019re trying to tell me it has nothing to do with masculinity?","855":"Yes, if you\u2019re secure in your masculinity then you don\u2019t need to prove it by being the one who earns more or performing different \u2018masculine\u2019 roles.","856":"Females use breast cancer awareness month as an excuse to be hoes on social media and show their boobs knowing damn well they know nothing about cancer.","857":"How are you angry at people raising awareness for breast cancer?","858":"They\u2019re just using it as an excuse to show that they\u2019re a whore on social media, it\u2019s all for attention.","859":"Whatever reason they\u2019re doing it for, why does it concern you what someone else choses to post on their own social media?","860":"It\u2019s disgusting when they\u2019re putting it all out there like that, some women have no self respect.","861":"It seems a lot of men have no issue with sexualising women, but when they sexualise themselves suddenly it\u2019s a sign that they have no \u2018self respect\u2019. Maybe having agency over your sexuality is a sign of high self respect, because they are taking control of their sexualisation?","862":"Oooooh mansplaining! Where'd you feminists learn this sexist term? In \"Misandry for dummies\"?","863":"Mansplaining is very real and any woman will tell you that, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ve all experienced it!","864":"How are you gonna make a man explaining something sound like it\u2019s a bad thing?","865":"It\u2019s not the fact they\u2019re explaining something, it\u2019s when they presume a woman won\u2019t know a very basic concept or piece of information, and they see themselves as intellectually superior.","866":"But how are they meant to know what women know already? Feminists will hate men for literally any reason\u2026","867":"It\u2019s patronising when it happens in certain contexts, for example sometimes it happens when a woman has already explained something then they explain it back to her as if she doesn\u2019t understand it. It\u2019s very frustrating!","868":"I hate when bitches are vain and think they\u2019re the prettiest bitch there is. That shit is unattractive.","869":"What\u2019s wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves?","870":"Vanity is not a good quality. They think they deserve everything and that they\u2019ve got no flaws.","871":"Women are taught to feel like they\u2019re not good enough through social conditioning and media their whole lives. To unlearn this and to actually like themselves takes a lot of mental strength and I\u2019m happy for them!","872":"Why do the ugliest hoes always talk the most?","873":"Why do you think someone shouldn\u2019t speak because of how they look?","874":"Ugly bitches just need to shut up sometimes.","875":"It sounds like you need to stop thinking that your opinions of women should have any bearing on how they want to behave. If you don\u2019t respect women you\u2019re not attracted to, or think are \u2018ugly\u2019, you\u2019re not seeing women as people, you\u2019re seeing them as objects.","876":"A bitch will expect you to treat her with respect even when her body count is in the 100s\u2026 who tf do these hoes think they are","877":"If you judge a woman based on how many people she\u2019s slept with, but you wouldn\u2019t judge a man for the same thing, that\u2019s a double standard!","878":"I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s nothing respectful about that. These bitches aren\u2019t even respecting themselves and they expect respect from men.","879":"It shouldn\u2019t matter how many people somebody has slept with or who they are, you should treat them with respect because they\u2019re a human being! Somebody\u2019s sexual history has nothing to do with this.","880":"The Muslim grooming gangs are a pandemic being ignored by the government and MSM. They are a threat to the UK. We need to defeat this filth.","881":"Yes, grooming gangs are an issue we need to tackle, but the issue isn\u2019t that they\u2019re Muslim, it\u2019s grooming gangs in general. By focusing on Muslim gangs only we are ignoring many other perpetrators","882":"That\u2019s not true, Muslim rape gangs have been getting away with it for so long because of lies like this.","883":"No, there\u2019s research to suggest that the majority of grooming gangs are made up of white non-Muslim men. By only focusing on Muslim grooming gangs, we are ignoring victims of these gangs.","884":"All of these white men committing mass killings and molesting children disgust me. They're totally appropriating Muslim culture!","885":"How did you manage to put an Islamophobic spin on atrocities committed by white non-Muslim men?","886":"It's true though, makes a change to see a white murderers with all the violent Jihadis that are usually committing these acts.","887":"Do you think maybe that has more to do with your perception and what media you consume, than with who is committing crimes? If you are looking at news that disproportionately reports on Muslim perpetrators, you probably won't notice that Muslims make up a minority of the perpetrators compared to white non-Muslims.","888":"Everyone knows that terrorism is a Muslim problem, you don't see white guys suicide bombing places.","889":"Are the mass shootings that happen frequently in the US not a type of terrorism? Largely committed by lone white males. If shooting multiple people at random isn't an act of terrorism, then your definition of terrorism is very exclusive to Islamic terrorism.","890":"What's another word for Islamophobia? Common sense.","891":"What makes you say that?","892":"People are too afraid to speak up these days incase they get cancelled by the PC brigade, Islamophobia is just calling it as it is; a cult.","893":"Islam isn't a cult, it's only as much of a cult as any other major religion. If you don't agree with Islam you don't have to follow it but hating people because they do is wrong.","894":"You can't say anything about Muslims these days without being told it's Islamophobia though, this is why Muslims are getting away with so much, they can't be called out.","895":"What do you think Muslims are 'getting away with'?","896":"violent crimes, rapes, trafficking and grooming, you name it. They're being let off light because people are scared of being labelled Islamophobic.","897":"I'd disagree with you there. There are plenty of recent examples of Muslim perpetators of these crimes being prosecuted, and if they've not been given long or appropriate sentences, I can almost guarantee that's nothing to do with them being Muslim, and probably more to do with how to court case went.","898":"Not all Muslims are terrorists... Some are still in training.","899":"Don't you think that Islamophobic stereotype is getting a bit old now? Obviously they're not all terrorists are they.","900":"There's no such thing as a moderate Muslim, I bet they all support the extremists even if they wouldn't say it openly.","901":"And that's based on what? Your misguided and uninformed perceptions of the Muslim community? The vast majority of Muslims are appalled at the actions of extremists, especially when it results in more hostility like this towards regular Muslims.","902":"What\u2019s the difference between E.T. and a Muslim refugee? E.T. learned to speak English and wanted to return home.","903":"Well E.T. probably wouldn't be returning home to civil war or persecution, which is why many refugees are forced to flee in the first place.","904":"I don't buy it, they just want to come here for the handouts. And they still don't bother to learn english.","905":"Would you give up your job, risk your life travelling in unsafe ways, and completely uproot your family just for a 'handout'? Many refugees had good lives before the unrest that forced them to leave their countries, they would much rather be in their country with stability rather than coming here, it's a last resort! Also, can you speak a second language?","906":"Not all of them, some of them don't have much to start with, they're uneducated and unemployable and come here hoping for a free ride. And no I can't speak another language because I don't need to, english is enough.","907":"If you can't speak a second language, then why do you feel so negatively about others who can't speak a second language (english) fluently? Most refugees would like to as it would help them to integrate but there are less government schemes for language classes now.","908":"\"U da bomb\", \"No, u iz the bomb\" -  A compliment in America, an argument in the Middle East.","909":"Have you not got any fresher jokes than pulling at outdated Islamophobic stereotypes about Muslims having bombs? Grow up.","910":"How is it 'Islamophobic' when most bombers are Middle Eastern and Muslim?","911":"It's Islamophobic because even though the stories of bombers you might see reported are mostly Muslims, most Muslims are not terrorists or bombers. Infact, Muslims in the middle east are probably the worst affected by bombs, not just from Islamic terrorism, but from Western interventionism.","912":"These fags want to brainwash our kids by teaching their sick agenda in schools. We can\u2019t stand for this.","913":"What \u2018agenda\u2019 do you mean exactly?","914":"Teaching them it\u2019s normal to be a transgender or to have same sex relationships. They\u2019re encouraging them into the lifestyle.","915":"I don\u2019t think that teaching kids that it\u2019s okay to be gay or trans is \u2018encouraging them\u2019 to be those things. It will help lgbt kids to feel less marginalised though!","916":"If they teach them it\u2019s acceptable they\u2019ll persuade some kids to try it.","917":"I really don\u2019t think sexuality works like that. Schools didn\u2019t teach about being lgbt+ in the past and there were still plenty of lgbt people. It\u2019s not about knowing it exists, it\u2019s about people who know they are lgbt feeling validated!","918":"If you don't see the connection between legitimizing the queer lifestyle and an increase in STD's and sexual deviancy then you're blind...","919":"Most STDs are contracted by straight people, this has nothing to do with how societally acceptable queer relationships are!","920":"But telling people that it\u2019s okay to be gay makes way for us normalising promiscuity, adultery, and other depraved behaviours. The queers have always been at it.","921":"So you\u2019re telling me no one straight was promiscuous or cheated in relationships before being LGBT was more acceptable? Sure.","922":"I just wanted to take a second here and say something positive about the gay community\u2026 HIV.","923":"That\u2019s a harmful and outdated stereotype. The LGBT+ community is actually more aware and vigilant about the spread of HIV than straight people are because of awareness spread after the epidemic in the 80s.","924":"So you\u2019re saying all the homos did get it because there was the epidemic. So they are HIV positive\u2026","925":"The epidemic affected all sorts of people, but the LGBT+ community were demonised in the media and blamed for it. Governments at the time didn\u2019t respond quickly or appropriately which caused tons of unnecessary deaths. Unfortunately many LGBT people affected at the time aren\u2019t with us anymore. Maybe educate yourself about it, there\u2019s plenty of documentaries.","926":"Lesbians are just the women that are too ugly for men, so they end up looking for other options. It's desperate.","927":"Nope, lesbians are... lesbians! I can promise you, lesbians really couldn't care less about if men think they're 'ugly'.","928":"they're in denial cause no man wants them, it's sad really.","929":"I'm begging you, please go talk to an actual lesbian. When you know men aren't for you, you know. Many queer women date men but then realise they're gay and start thriving! Nothing beats being true to yourself.","930":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","931":"Nope, lesbians are happy living their lives outside of the male gaze!","932":"No way they are happy pretending to like women, they can't even have good sex because no one has a dick.","933":"If you can't imagine how lesbian sex works then I feel sorry for the women you have slept with! Why don't you just live and let live, lesbians exist whether you believe it or not!","934":"Lesbians are just bitter man haters. what a miserable lifestyle.","935":"Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be in a relationship with them. What's wrong with that?","936":"It's an unbalanced way to live. Then you see lesbians trying to act like men and be masculine to fill in for the lack of men in their lives.","937":"I don't think that's why some lesbians are more masculine. Someone's gender expression is about who they are and what makes them comfortable, it's not about making up for not having male influence in their lives.","938":"I'm fine with gay people as long as they aren't gay around me.","939":"So you're not fine with gay people then?","940":"No I'm fine with them living their lifestyle but I don't want my family exposed to it, what's wrong with that?","941":"If you don't think it's fine for your family to see, then you don't think it's fine. What is it about gay people that you don't want to 'expose' to your family?","942":"I don't want my children growing up thinking it's a normal lifestyle to have. Yes, some people can't help being gay, but that doesn't mean we should encourage it as a way of life.","943":"It's not 'encouraging' it. If you think exposing your children to gay people will 'encourage' them to be gay, I don't think you understand how sexuality works. If your children are gay, they'll be gay, if they're straight, they'll be straight, and you should love them for who they are either way!","944":"Girl, you're not bi. There's no such thing. You're just horny and greedy.","945":"Nope I'm bi, just because you can't wrap your head around the idea of attraction not being based on gender, it doesn't mean bi people don't exist!","946":"I don't know, it sounds like bi people are either gay and in denial or straight and experimenting.","947":"Bi people are attracted to people because of who they are as individuals, not just because of their gender, it's not a difficult concept to understand!","948":"I don't care if some gays somewhere get married. What I care about is when this begins to affect my children.","949":"Gays getting married won't ever affect your children, unless they're invited to the wedding, in which case it'll have the effect of giving them a fun event to go to.","950":"What if it's the start of a slippery slope though, first marriage, then things like gay history month, then who knows what...","951":"Genuinely curious what you think would come next? And why it would be bad?","952":"They might start trying to normalise the more deviant parts of the lifestyle, you see those men dressed like dogs and stuff in pride parades, that stuff is messed up and we can't start telling kids thats normal.","953":"Kink\/bdsm isn't necessarily a gay thing, yeah there's sometimes kink related groups at pride but this is very much a thing that straight people do too. It's really got nothing to do with gay marriage or gay rights of any sort.","954":"I hate when parents make a big deal about 'embracing' their kids being gay when they're only young teens. It's just a phase, they're too young to decide their sexuality, it's harmful to encourage this delusion.","955":"If they know, they know. What makes you think they don't know what they want?","956":"They don't know what they want when they're just kids. They might just be saying they're gay cause they've seen it in a tv show or are fans of gay celebrities or something. Kids are very impressionable.","957":"We live in a very heteronormative society, where there's lots of pressure to be straight because it's the only sexuality that's normalised. If a teen is saying they're gay they will have realised this despite growing up in a society that assumes everyone is straight. If they're 'impressionable' then they would think they're straight!","958":"If you left 1000 men on an island with 1000 women who were men but now according to morons on twitter are now women the islands would become extinct in a generation.","959":"Okay, what's your point?","960":"These so called 'women' are not women. It's delusional.","961":"So you think that what makes a woman a woman is her ability to have children?","962":"Just saying these trannys could never do what women are biologically wired to do.","963":"If you put 1000 men on an island with 1000 cisgender women with reproductive health conditions that prevent them from getting pregnant, the population would still become extinct in a generation. Are you saying women who can't have children aren't women?","964":"But they've got a womb. What I mean is if everyone woke up and decided to be a different gender then we'd all die out.","965":"Okay well the majority of people aren't transgender, so I don't think this is an issue? Sounds like you're using an unrealistic hypothetical situation to reach wild conclusions about the real world.","966":"These men pretending to be women & their supporters are at the moment, the biggest threat to our normal society.","967":"I dunno, I'd probably say the biggest 'threat' to our society could be climate change, terrorism and extremism, inequality, but okay...","968":"They're infiltrating womens spaces and putting our girls at risk.","969":"If you're genuinely concerned about womens rights maybe start by addressing the misogyny and violence women face from men, before blaming trans women.","970":"The phrase 'black lives matter' suggests racial superiority. It excludes the importance of anyone elses life. This is racism defined. We cannot bow down to these racists.","971":"Saying one thing matters does not insinuate that other things do not matter. You can care about and value more than one thing at once.","972":"What do the 'black lives matter' protesters do to show that they support white lives too?","973":"Their purpose is to protest against anti-black racism, they don't need to show they care about white lives too. White lives mattering is implied in the structural privilege afforded to white people.","974":"So they don't care about white lives?? Just what I said, they're racist.","975":"Single issue campaign groups don't have to prove they care about everyone else. This is like asking LGBT organisations what they do to advocate for straight people. They don't need to because straight people are accepted in society and don't face a disadvantage caused by their straightness.","976":"It seems that some men will rape anything that moves, women, children, animals. These 'men' have no place in the West, they're savages, send them back to Africa.","977":"Are you suggesting men from 'the West' don't commit sexual assault? Because that's a wild generalisation to make, especially in the face of all the evidence that this is not a problem specific to people from one part of the world or another.","978":"You can't deny there's a pattern with all these news stories about migrant rapists, it's always the Africans who are coming over under the guise of being 'asylum seekers'. They just want to brutalise white women.","979":"In over 90% of sexual assaults, the perpetrator is known to the victim, and is often a family member, partner, or friend. This suggests that when you see news stories about migrants raping girls in the street, the reason these stories made it into the news is because they're unusual and shocking.","980":"So you're just going to ignore the victims of those incidents?","981":"No, those incidents do happen, but what I'm saying is that the majority of sexual assaults aren't committed by migrants, and to think that stopping migration would solve the issue of sexual violence against women is short sighted!","982":"Sharia law has nothing to do with law and everything to do with domination. You cannot have two sets of laws in a country.","983":"Part of sharia law is respecting the law of the country you're in, so actually yes, you can have two sets of laws in a country.","984":"That's all alright until they make all of us submit to sharia too","985":"Muslims might choose to follow sharia in their own lives, just like how you might follow the teachings of your own religion or beliefs, but it doesn't mean you have to.","986":"Eventually they'll want us all to do it though, when they become the majority","987":"If you look at religions that have grown in the UK in the last century, this has never happened with the Jewish community, hindus, sikhs, etc. There's nothing to suggets it would be any different with Islam.","988":"The liberal left is in crisis due to the overcrowding of prisons. Your country should not welcome illegal migrants but regular ones.\n","989":"It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights. we are in the 21st century, it is a duty.","990":"I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people\n","991":"Migrants need help. They flee to find better living conditions and I think our country is suited to their needs.\n","992":"I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people.","993":"I don't think it is a problem to give a solution to the needy in houses that are currently empty.\n","994":"The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state\n","995":"Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right?\n","996":"I think it's unfair that they have our same rights .. if they want them, they must pay the taxes charged by the state. That's how it works\n\n\n","997":"Our country is the cause of many evils that still afflict poor countries. We have the duty to help them and take on our responsibilities.","998":"The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back.","999":"The problem here is not whether they should or shouldn't come, but it's about how they're getting treated while in detention. It wouldn't be bad to put them in detention humanely.","1000":"I agree, but how would you do so? Perhaps at the expense of our vetrian or old people like me? If we give them everything we'll be left with nothing.","1001":"There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions.","1002":"Are you saying that we should put illegal immigrants in houses? You have to be kidding!","1003":"What's wrong about putting people in need in houses which are not being used.","1004":"The British people should use those houses, not immigrants.","1005":"There are enough empty homes in the UK for both migrants and veterans. Migrants deserve to be treated humanly, try having some empathy. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions.","1006":"We as tax-payer should be the only ones benefitting from these house, not illegal immigrants.","1007":"We have a responsibility over them, since we caused a lot of disruption in their countries through our foreign policy. We displaced people, at least we sholud show compassion now. Would you not agree?","1008":"Why are we still convinced that Muslims are being abused? They are the ones who abuse us. We have to get ahead and not be afraid of being judged for our opinion. The truth must be told!","1009":"I'll give you a link that tells the opposite: [LINK]","1010":"The real question is: why when they commit crimes it is never known by anyone? Social media don't talk about it at all and everyone ignores the facts..\n","1011":"In my view, Muslims are blamed as much as \"white people\". I always see news that paint them all with the same brush and I don't think it's correct.","1012":"Many years ago I had Muslim friends. One night they went around the city to commit serious crimes like child abuse etc .. This situation, although it has been going on for days, has never been named by social media. If the opposite happened, the whole world would have been aware of these crimes. Instead, I would like to see articles that talk about attacks made by Muslims .. since I've never had the chance!","1013":"I understand your point of view and I am very sorry for your bad experience. But it is not logical to think that due to mistakes of certain people we should blame all for having chosen to believe in that religion.\n","1014":"Nowadays people fear of being judged islamophobes or racists that they would give anything to muslims: where's this anti muslim abuse everyone's talking about?","1015":"Give a look at this if you want: [LINK]","1016":"How come when it's them to commit crimes you never see it on the media?","1017":"Muslims are being used quite a lot as scapegoats by the media for social issues.","1018":"Let me tell you a story: one day I found out that my muslim friends committed serious crimes that no media talked about. If these attack's had been committed by white fellas on muslim ones, it would have been a windfall for mainstream media at all levels, from local to national. We all know it, come on!","1019":"I'm sorry to hear about your story, violence is never acceptable. But is it fair to blame all Muslims, the vast majority of whom live peacefully with us? ","1020":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt .. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","1021":"We should let people live for what they are and above all we must accept their differences. Not in all cases there is the need to force an integration. Some people are more integrated than the current English\r\n","1022":"I see your point of view.\nBut I think the only \"acceptable\" relationships and the only normal ones are heterosexuals.\nThis is just my opinion.","1023":"I am glad that we agree on this point but don't you think the same goes for migrants? Every one can have his  beliefs and culture, the important thing is that there is respect.","1024":"Our experiences have taught us that multi-ethnicity has not given great results .. especially in a civil society like ours.\nLet's end with this lie about integration. It will never work!","1025":"We haven't tried enough. There are so many ways to integrate to test that haven't been used! I also want to add that integration doesn't mean to become the same as us; they must maintain their culture\n","1026":"As Theodore Roosevelt stated, in order to immigrate and live in another country successfully one must fully integrate. Then there will be no opposition against it.","1027":"We used to ask people to assimilate our culture but know we accept people's differences. Transgender people just want to exist without having to be harmed for being 'different', it's unnecessary for them to try to 'integrate' more than they already have to ","1028":"I agree, although personally I am only in favour of heterosexual relationships, I don't mind other's preferences as long as they're within respectable limits of other's preferences. However that isn't related with migrants tryng to create their enclaves backing their own foreing cultures.","1029":"I'm glad you agree, however I tought your post was related to the article about transgender people. Don't you thing that could be also applied to migrants? As long as people respect each other they don't have to assimilate but they could even maintain their differences","1030":"I disagree, multiculturalism has failed miserably. Both here and in Europe. When people live in closed communities and don't integrate there will always will be problems.","1031":"Division can cause problems, I agree, but maybe integration isn't all about assimilation. I think more needs to be done in order to make integration happen. The government used to fund free English lessons but now language is a big obstacle to integration.","1032":"Muslims demand locals to not walk their dogs in public because it's againt the Sharia and they feel it as disrespectful.","1033":"This was a prank planned by non-muslims on 4chan. Muslim do not mind if you take your dogs out for a walk. This blog post shows the thread it came from;","1034":"Thank you for the infos, I left the information on the bottom of the original tweet once it was sent to me by someone. Still, they heaps worse. You probably haven't seen the vids where they are killing dogs with acid.","1035":"Animal cruelty isn't right but it also isn't an issue concerning only Muslims. People of all faiths do it. I think it's important to rembember how in twitter a person encounters only beliefs or opinions that coincide with their own. Fake news which put Muslims under a bad light get belived and the selective media feed this.","1036":"Ah yeah, I've heard your point of view expressed but you still have not taken a look through the thread yet. Apples and oranges are not the same and cultures have never been 'equal'.","1037":"All I see on the thread is people supporting their own point of view. You can find outdated teaching in all major religions but it doesn't mean most people follow those parts, a similare example from Christianity: Ephesians 5:22, \"Wives, submit to you husbands as to the Lord\"","1038":"Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture..  They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public!\n","1039":"You have to be careful about what you read! This is clearly a fake news, widespread to make a scandal.\n","1040":"\nIt's not the only bad information I read about them.\nThey have a bad reputation and there will be a reason. I even saw a video where they kill dogs with acid!","1041":"The act of killing dogs with acid is serious, but we cannot blame an entire religion for something that some people did.\nIt is up to us to filter the information that social media gives us","1042":"Your opinion does not convince me.\nCultures have never been fair and this is a fact..","1043":"Again, we can't point the finger at a religion \/ culture for some old commandment. Even Christianity has rules that may seem crazy, but rightly people do not hate Christians for this.. a small example: Ephesians 5:22, \"Wives, submit to you husbands as the Lord\"\n","1044":"Following the structure of our population we have to stop and reverse all migration. We have got all the doctors and rocket scientists we need. We will never need any workforce from outside the country.","1045":"As a matter of fact, most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers. The medical students of the United Kingdom that do go on to be doctors are increasingly emigrating for better woking condition, given the contacts that Junior doctors have to deal with. Perhaps what we do need are some fundings to the NHS so that it cant treat its staff properly? ","1046":"Look darling. No one is pressuring these people to become doctors. They are smart so they should have worked out what the terms and conditions are. These people are not moving out to poor countries abroad, I suppose. The NHS must be taken down and rivisited. How come this people are so racist? Their only focus is the colour of the skin of the doctor.  In my opnion, immigrant doctors should work where they have studied.","1047":"It's not about skin colour. It's about undermining that UK relies on migrant labour. We literally would not manage if migration was stopped. Despite what some biased media say, the contribution of migrants outweighs all the problems that we might face in accepting them.","1048":"\nI firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries.","1049":"\nYou may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants.\nIf there were no more foreigners the health system would fail. Furthermore, the young graduate doctors are all running away from our country, 'cause the working conditions and the treatment received are very bad. The NHS should be better supported so that it offers greater opportunities for our young people.","1050":"The NHS is now lost, it should be reorganized from scratch. In addition, young people should have the good sense not to study medicine if these are the consequences! \nHonestly, it is not convenient for colored people to work in European countries. The people here are racist and superficial; it is better if they work where they have studied!","1051":"\nThe speech did not include anyone's skin color.\nThe point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to England. We must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite.","1052":"I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s.","1053":"There has always been migrant skilled labour migration into the UK, we have even contributed inviting asian and caribbean worker after WW2 to fill skills gaps Migration isn't new, how it is being shown in the media has changed in order to cause a panic among people about high levels of migration.","1054":"We have a lot of issues in the UK.  How good an organisation can only be as much as how good the leader controlling it is, that's appliable to all kinds of organisation such as hospitals, schools or police. Wouldn't it be fantastic having a  truthful, strong PM who ignored the PC?","1055":"An article dated 3 years ago quoting Christopher Chope. Very reliable!","1056":"I'm aware of the fact they're old but still, I'm sure they're still going on and how many other financial scandals still have to be announced to the tax payers?","1057":"This kind of articles use migrants and benefit claimants as scapegoats in order to hide from the public's attention much bigger scandals. Millionares and coorporations avoid paying taxes cost much more to the public purse.","1058":"For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair)","1059":"Migration has always been part of the history of humanity and even the British, when they needed it, invited people to migrate. Right now, social media and news programs make it seem like a scandal, putting all foreigners in a bad light.","1060":"In my opinion in England we should worry about something else. Important facilities like schools and hospitals are poorly organized. It takes a prime minister to take care of these necessary needs and improve the country.\n","1061":"Here is an article from 3 years ago, which quote Christopher Chope. Completely trustworthy!\n","1062":"I know it's not recent, but I think it's still progressing. And what scares me the most is that we are not yet aware of all the other financial scandals!","1063":"The problem is that most of the British population is not aware of the fact that the media use the \"scandal\" of immigrants to hide bigger problems for the country; such as taxes not paid by millionaires and large corporations which then fall on us citizens.","1064":"Negroes are the cause of all the problems in our nation. They are violent and unstable.","1065":"Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's attention from the real problems and the real criminals to prejudices. We should be careful as a nation not to fall into these mindtricks.","1066":"These are not mindtricks! Black people are the real source of crime in our society.","1067":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","1068":"Fuck that shit! Black people came here illegally, and now they want to take our money with the excuse of being poor.","1069":"Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.","1070":"Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned.","1071":"It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception.","1072":"You cannot integrate shit, because Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land.","1073":"If you would be so kind as to comply with the law, you would know that everybody has the right to practice their religion freely, without being subject to arrest and prosecution.","1074":"It is not about the right to practice your religion: the problem is that Jewish are taking over our country!","1075":"What percentage of people in the US are Jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that.","1076":"Gays are perverts.","1077":"Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.","1078":"You better watch out, because they are the real psychopaths.","1079":"According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual.","1080":"I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers.","1081":"The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism.","1082":"This is not about racism, it's the harsh truth: they were born to be savages.","1083":"Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more \"savage\" than others?","1084":"Because we are better off when we are all white and united under the same culture. We are not strong when we are divided by black savages who want to fight us.","1085":"We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism. and a limited notion of 'unity'?","1086":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society.","1087":"The statistics on this matter are very vague. Could you vouch for the veracity of the statement?","1088":"Yes! All those I know agree that LGBT+ people are a burden to society, a bunch of gutless whiners.","1089":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","1090":"Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak.","1091":"Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections.","1092":"But they are just a burden to society!","1093":"Just because they are not male, it does not mean that they should be discriminated against for who they are.","1094":"Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything.","1095":"The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.","1096":"They don't have any social advantage because they are just a bunch of brain-dead criminals and thieves, a threat to the security of our country.","1097":"Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.","1098":"All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","1099":"Do you really think that all black people are worth less than other people? There is no evidence for this.","1100":"Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous apes.","1101":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","1102":"There are migrants in England, we are not meant to have them.","1103":"What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here.","1104":"They might have the right to be here, but not to take our houses. British people should have right to social housing, not immigrants.","1105":"Many councils have \u2018local connection\u2019 rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants.","1106":"Ok then, what about all those immigrants that turned out to be a bunch of criminals and terrorists?","1107":"The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth.","1108":"Distorting what?? The truth is that they are rapists and drug dealers. They are ruining our cities and killing our youth. They are obviously invaders invading our beautiful land.","1109":"If you really wanted to preserve our beautiful land you could build a wall and bar OUR people from it. Sometimes I feel like UK citizens are the main cause of our problems.","1110":"Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.","1111":"The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans. It has nothing to do with political correctness.","1112":"Come on, the N-word is part of our culture!","1113":"If it's a cultural issue then they should teach about the N-word only in history classes. Otherwise, it's just another excuse to justify racism.","1114":"Islam is a violent religion.","1115":"We must not forget that Islam is a religion of peace. So why do you say so?","1116":"Because it spreads like a virus!","1117":"The idea that Islam is a virus is just an excuse for people to promote hate against that religion.","1118":"You are wrong: Islam is a disease and it must be eradicated.","1119":"Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief.","1120":"Islam is sickening our world and Mosques are the disease carriers.","1121":"In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque'","1122":"Gay men are a burden to society.","1123":"Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.","1124":"Ok, but their ideas are harmful to our society.","1125":"No. Sexual abuse, physical abuse and even the lack of security are harmful to the overall health of a society.","1126":"migrants rape our women","1127":"Statistics show that there is a difference between the reported rape of a person by a migrant and the actual rape cases among native born people. The latter are always under-reported.","1128":"Ok, but migration is still a problem because they are replacing the people born in our country. We should block them.","1129":"It is important to point out that only a small part of the world's population has migrated. We should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to the immigrants that are already in the country, rather than blocking out those who are trying to live a better life.","1130":"Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","1131":"Comparing the scale of the horrible destruction and genocide inflicted by Nazism, with a group of people solely because of their religious beliefs is unacceptable and illogical.","1132":"But Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges.","1133":"I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.","1134":"No, they really believe they can be above the rules and want society to be adapted to their religious needs. ","1135":"Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then?","1136":"Afro-Caribbean's are just a bunch of stupid and dangerous dancing n*ggers, they should be banned.","1137":"There are still incidents of hate speech being hurled at people from different ethnic backgrounds, and it is because of the fear of different ways of life.","1138":"No, it is not about fear. They REALLY are just a bunch of criminal monkeys.","1139":"I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior.","1140":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture.","1141":"That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.","1142":"but Islam is a religion of conquest.","1143":"The definition of 'religion of conquest' is a political and social construct, used to justify the forcible removal of people's rights. If you want to talk about religion, I would just say that Islam is a religion of peace.","1144":"Islam is NOT a religion of peace!","1145":"As a matter of fact, Islam is about love, not hate.","1146":"Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, admit it!","1147":"Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs.","1148":"Faggots are perverts and sinners, we need to track them down and save them.","1149":"You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for.","1150":"But same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured!","1151":"There are different sexual orientations. Being gay does not automatically make you mentally ill, and being straight does not automatically make you sane.","1152":"Trust me: if we isolate them, then we can cure them.","1153":"Look, it is the fact of being socially isolated that brings many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives?","1154":"We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore!","1155":"Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.","1156":"That is a lie, if we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","1157":"Do you have any evidence for the fact that the migrants are a burden to the economy?","1158":"Yes! For example, we are paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers?","1159":"This kind of articles use migrants and benefit claimants as scapegoats in order to hide from the public's attention much bigger scandals. Millionares and coorporations avoiding paying taxes cost much more to the public purse.","1160":"Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle!","1161":"Does the LGBT+ lifestyle change your life? Only if you care. But that doesn't mean that homosexuality is a lifestyle.","1162":"We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is also a mental disorder.","1163":"Sorry but is it a lifestyle or a mental disorder? I'm a bit confused now. Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.","1164":"We should eliminate gays.","1165":"Do you really want to kill someone?","1166":"Yes, it would be an act of mercy towards them: gays are hopelessly sick.","1167":"Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago.","1168":"But gay men are a danger to children! ","1169":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","1170":"You did not answer to my point: children should be isolated from the negative influence of gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people.","1171":"What you are saying is so sad. You are considering gays as inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately this attitude is not limited to parenting.","1172":"Who the fuck are you? We are scared to death of Muslims because they want to make us their slaves.","1173":"Muslims in Britain have contributed a lot to our economy. They are true innovators in modern Britain.","1174":"Innovators? Thank you for making me laugh... Islam is a cancer on the European culture.","1175":"The Qur'an is not a cancer on the European culture, it is a very useful book and an inspiration to many.","1176":"If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done.","1177":"People of every gender can own and run their own businesses. We should respect that.","1178":"Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires.","1179":"What should be guaranteed are equality and respect for women's rights, not a pandering to the desires of men.","1180":"Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities.","1181":"They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy.","1182":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male.","1183":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men. how many more times do we have to repeat it? ","1184":"I am tired of women blaming men for what they aren't able to change.","1185":"I don't understand why you feel that way about women. Don't you feel we should be giving them support? Doesn't it just seem a bit selfish to you not to help them in their fight for equality?","1186":"Fight for equality??? Feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights!","1187":"If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellow humans, regardless of gender.","1188":"Feminism is a threat to human dignity.","1189":"Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights is necessary for a functioning society.","1190":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","1191":"How can it be that people who have a different skin tone are a threat just for this reason?","1192":"Because I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women.","1193":"You can't generalise about a whole race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work.","1194":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","1195":"Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit.","1196":"That is not true. It is well known that Jewish power structures control Congress, control the media, control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done.","1197":"Just like everyone else, I am sure Jews are trying to influence the world in a positive way but there is no proof they are the only ones with power in this world.","1198":"The proof is that they have controlled the world for ages.","1199":"if Jews really ran or controlled the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control...","1200":"I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people.","1201":"Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.","1202":"On the contrary: making laws against homosexuals would be very moral. ","1203":"A person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.","1204":"It is government duty to protect the weak: gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","1205":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","1206":"But gays ARE a danger to children: they are a bunch of filthy pedophiles.","1207":"Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement or our view of reality.","1208":"Black uneducated people should shut up and work.","1209":"Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin.","1210":"You can have your say if you contribute to society, but Blacks do not want to work","1211":"There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?","1212":"Refugees should not be welcomed.","1213":"Refugees are often persecuted for being different, but this is not the case here, because we are an inclusive country.","1214":"How can we be inclusive if they do not want to integrate? We cannot coexist with immigrants. They are a problem that we must address.","1215":"We should not ignore the very real fact that racism and xenophobia exist in our country. In this day and age, it is better to address them first. ","1216":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want. ","1217":"Black people are in fact often persecuted. The idea that after BLM protests they have any inherent right to privileges that others do not is just blatantly false.","1218":"Come on, it is well known that black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. ","1219":"Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The \u2018super predator\u2019 myth is simply wrong.","1220":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","1221":"We should work with them, not against them. They are our brothers.","1222":"They are NOT our brothers: They do not share our values and they are not interested in our future.","1223":"This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country.","1224":"So much contribution that we need special laws to control them. They are just a trouble.","1225":"We don't need laws and policies to control Muslims. Instead we need to solve problems by sharing knowledge, by decreasing social inequalities, by ending poverty and a whole host of other things.","1226":"The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma.","1227":"The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.","1228":"Proud of what?  Of controlling and subjugating the world?","1229":"if Jews really subjugated or controlled the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control...","1230":"Believe me, the world would be a better place without Jews.","1231":"Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.","1232":"Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected.","1233":"Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in.","1234":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","1235":"Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?","1236":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for the economy?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core British values.","1237":"Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. Your comment is sounding very dramatic. For what reasons does it put us in danger?","1238":"If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","1239":"Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.","1240":"No way: immigrants are criminals and they are STEALING wealth from the country.","1241":"Mostly they are workers, the majority of them are from developing countries. They contribute to the economy, they build houses, they raise families.","1242":"Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality.","1243":"What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think this is the case?","1244":"Because they are dangerous psychopaths.","1245":"According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual.","1246":"You pretend not to understand: gays are just sick! We should ban them!","1247":"Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.","1248":"What about sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis, then? They can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity! And then they'll pass it to our children!","1249":"All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized.","1250":"I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys.","1251":"It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights.","1252":"Until women are submissive to men they should have no rights. That's the only thing they are good at.  ","1253":"This is not true. Women are human, and they have always been involved in society and played important roles.","1254":"Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time.","1255":"Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.","1256":"Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","1257":"Black people are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about the beauty of respect.","1258":"Black people are nothing but apes: how can you respect apes?","1259":"I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason using racism.","1260":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","1261":"How many Muslims do you know? They are an important minority in a country that is used to a lot of different cultures and religions.","1262":"Actually I know many Muslims and they are the only minority committing crimes in my neighbourhood.","1263":"Have you looked at the crime statistics in your area? Are you sure that Islam is specifically associated with crime in your area?","1264":"What about illness then? Muslim are ilnesses carriers! These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","1265":"According to the WHO (World Health Organisation) there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 WHO member states as of 2011. A study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. So the problem has nothing to do with DNA.","1266":"Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings.","1267":"This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem.","1268":"It makes you a problem at the very moment you start poisoning our children's mind with your icky perversion.","1269":"This is not true. If a claim is based on facts, then it must be true. If you just talk of stereotypes, then you won't go very far.","1270":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","1271":"Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief.","1272":"The Koran promotes a false religion, filled with hatred and violence.","1273":"Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.","1274":"NO! Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate.","1275":"The Quran says to \"love your enemies\", and not to hate them. Did you skip that bit?","1276":"I do not need to read the Quran to know that Islam is the worst religion of all.","1277":"Once and for all: Islam is not a religion of intolerance, and there is no evidence that it encourages violence.","1278":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","1279":"Why do you think that we should prevent migrants from joining our society? Do you know what is written in our constitution?","1280":"I do not know what is written in our constitution, but I know what it shoud be written: that they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell.","1281":"As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.","1282":"It is ok to be racist against blacks.","1283":"It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.","1284":"But it is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","1285":"What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","1286":"How can they be our brother and sisters when their race is subhuman?","1287":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","1288":"Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society.","1289":"Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society.","1290":"\"Empowerment\", my ass: they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","1291":"Women have been oppressed by men. The level of equality that exists today is due, in large part, to the work of women like Germaine Greer.","1292":"Feminists like Germaine Greer are nothing but trouble to this society.","1293":"Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out like Germaine Greer did. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.","1294":"Migrants are not welcome here.","1295":"They are welcome in our country, because we are a multicultural society.","1296":"Ok then, Migrants might be welcome in our country. But they are not welcome in my house and they are not welcome in my church.","1297":"Migrants should be welcome everywhere, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life.","1298":"Listen, with the excuse of \"living their life\" they become a drain on society.","1299":"Among the 1.1 million immigrants who entered the US in 1990 there were also a lot of skilled workers who contributed a lot to the development of our society.","1300":"Who cares about gay people!","1301":"Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us.","1302":"Their opinions and lifestyle are toxic to our society!","1303":"The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies.","1304":"All immigrants from Africa are lazy freeloader.","1305":"This is not true. Many of them are actually skilled workers.","1306":"Still, we are forced to economically support all of them.","1307":"As the INPS indicates, they are now contributing to the payment of our pensions because they are not yet in the retirement age.","1308":"Bullshit, they absorb most of the public spending!","1309":"The cost of immigration from the last Economic and Financial Document, published last April and containing the consolidated figure for 2017, is estimated to have a total expenditure of about 4.4 billion euros, which represents only 0.26% of Italian GDP, and around 0.5% of public spending. In short, 99.5% of public resources are used for something else.","1310":"The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated.","1311":"Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle as there are still ideas like the one you expressed.","1312":"Ok, now you are going to say that I'm homophobic, right?","1313":"Many people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but when I read such statements I don't see any evidence of that.","1314":"Jews are not only here to oppress us, but to control the world.","1315":"Most Jews are good people, apart from a few; I don't see how these few can be a problem to the whole world.","1316":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules, and this applies to all Jews, not to \"just a few\".","1317":"I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.","1318":"Therein lies the rub! Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their religion, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d is inherited through blood.","1319":"Did you know that the concept of \u201cracial science,\u201d and therefore the notion of the Jewish \u201crace\u201d, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.","1320":"It is a crime to be a Muslim.","1321":"There is no law forbidding you to be a Muslim. It is a human right to pursue whatever religion you wish.","1322":"And there is nothing to stop you becoming an Islamic terrorist then.","1323":"We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.","1324":"but Islam is opposed to peace!","1325":"Did you know that in Islam, all religions are welcome?","1326":"Even if in Islam all religions are welcome, it is incompatible with modern culture and should be rejected out of hand.","1327":"This is not true. Islam is a way of life for many different people, and it can't be simply 'rejected' because you don't like it.","1328":"To have a real democracy, the government needs to get rid of Jews.","1329":"Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'.","1330":"So how can we obtain a real democracy?","1331":"For sure not by persecuting Jews. As long as there are people persecuted for their religious beliefs or ideas, there will never be a real democracy.","1332":"But Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and politics!","1333":"Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.","1334":"We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant.","1335":"Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'?","1336":"Yes, it's when your nation is floaded with immigrants and loafers.","1337":"Loafers? We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","1338":"If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she\u2019s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role.","1339":"It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.","1340":"I'm tired of woman \"choosing their own lives\". Feminism is a divisive force in society!","1341":"A new social concept almost always brings division but this doesn't make it unworthy of implementation. The abolition of slavery in the U.S. being the best example.","1342":"Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman in parenting","1343":"Love is love, children need only this.","1344":"You better be careful who you stand up for. For example, my gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them!","1345":"What 'we' means? Are you saying that every gay person you know should vote against you? Or do you think some of us identify as LGBT?","1346":"It\u2019s no use trying to mess with my head... These gays are insane! They should go back to the closet.","1347":"I do not know why you would describe gay people as insane. If you were told to go back in the closet you would probably go insane too.","1348":"Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.","1349":"If it's a cultural issue then they should teach about the N-word only in history classes. Otherwise, it's just another excuse to justify racism.","1350":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","1351":"This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","1352":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","1353":"Considering all the criticisms of the state of Israel (however right or wrong, does not matter) I don't see how you can say that Jews are operating \"with impunity, free from criticism.\"","1354":"Gotcha! Speaking of Israel, there's also the problem that Jews cannot be patriots to our country, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel.","1355":"It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive.","1356":"I do not want gays in my children's classes.","1357":"I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.","1358":"But they can harm our children's cognitive and emotional development","1359":"If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange will happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false.","1360":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","1361":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","1362":"Immigrants steal our jobs, and this make many people unhappy!","1363":"The right to work is a fundamental human right, and not granting this right to immigrants would mean to revoke a fundamental right enshrined in the US constitution.","1364":"Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals.","1365":"Criminals are criminals, no matter their nationality.","1366":"I agree, but there is no reason to \"import\" other criminals. We have enough of ours!","1367":"I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated...","1368":"Evidence tells that all immigrants are criminals, rapists and terrorists","1369":"Do you really think all the immigrants that enter the US are rapists, sexual predators, or just plain lazy? Can you provide any statistics on that?","1370":"I do not need some fancy statistics: Immigrants are just here to commit crimes ","1371":"There are many reasons for why a person seeks to enter our country, not necessarly to commit crimes. And, as already stated, there is no moral distinction between crimes committed by immigrants and the crimes committed by native born citizens.","1372":"Jews can only act in a bad way.","1373":"Even if some Jews act wrongly, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion.","1374":"Ok, are you impying that I have a prejudice against Jews? ","1375":"The problem of anti-Semitism in the UK is far from over, if you are concerned about Jewish people, maybe think about the rise of anti-Semitism instead.","1376":"Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation.","1377":"You are not saying that Islam is not a religion of peace, are you?","1378":"Yes, Islam is not a peaceful religion.","1379":"The vast majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful. Do you have any facts suppporting your argument?","1380":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","1381":"The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise?","1382":"They are called \"human rights\" not \"subhuman rights\". ","1383":"Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are subhuman is totally intolerable.","1384":"Intolerable is this attack on our great patriarchal society using the concept of so-called human rights for women.","1385":"The concept of human dignity was established to protect people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected.","1386":"Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned.","1387":"It is in the interest of all humanity to have a peaceful and integrated society. Diversity of opinion and belief is the rule rather than the exception.","1388":"But Jews are the ones who do not want to integrate: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment.","1389":"Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures.","1390":"Then why they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood? In fact, many people are banned from entering Israel.","1391":"Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all.","1392":"Women who do not want children are whores","1393":"Whore is a term of abuse used to describe women who have sex outside of marriage. Why there is not a counterpart for men?","1394":"Because unlike women, men want to contribute to the country's wealth.","1395":"Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged.","1396":"We should eliminate gays.","1397":"Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences?","1398":"That's right. We should start a genocide against gays.","1399":"That is not acceptable. We are full members of society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody.","1400":"I hate gays","1401":"Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights.","1402":"Also God hates gays","1403":"If you consider that homosexuals have always been a part of our society, then it means that they are part of the divine plan and of its beauty as well.","1404":"But the Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination.","1405":"According to the Bible, a book written more than two thousand years ago, homosexuality is a sin. Is this enough for us to hate those who practice it today?","1406":"Migrants are not running away from wars.","1407":"Would you risk your life and that of your children only on a whim? Don't you think that there must be life-or-death situations pushing these person to escape from their countries?","1408":"But statistics says that many migrants come from countries that are not at war!","1409":"It is true, they often run away from persecution, violence and hunger. If I were in the same situation, I would not think twice about escaping. Wouldn't you do the same? It seems to me a very human instinct.","1410":"The Jews control the banks.","1411":"So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm","1412":"Sarcasm does not rule out that Jews control many institutions. ","1413":"How can you be sure that Jews control 'many institutions'? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof?","1414":"The liberal left is in crisis due to the overcrowding of prisons with migrants. We should set a good example by beating the shit out of them, so they'll lose the will to enter our country. ","1415":"It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights. We are in the 21st century, it is a duty.","1416":"But immigrants bring crime, they are rapists.","1417":"We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.","1418":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","1419":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","1420":"Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","1421":"You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind.","1422":"Humankind would be better without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.","1423":"Reality is that black people are persecuted all over the world for the crime of being black. I don't see how this could be said for white people.","1424":"If a woman is beaten, it is because her man wants to correct her bad behaviour.","1425":"It is estimated that over the 50% of people committing domestic abuse were drunk. It's a complex issue but two things I know for sure: a drunk person is in no position to judge anyone's behaviour and beating a person is ALWAYS wrong.","1426":"Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge being beaten.","1427":"Feminists aren't vengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?","1428":"Feminists want women ruling men, that's all.","1429":"Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose.","1430":"Men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that.","1431":"How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to?","1432":"Jews are a despisable race.","1433":"Jews are human beings. To be despised does not make one despicable.","1434":"Still, the world would be a better place without Jews.","1435":"Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.","1436":"It is not intolerance: Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all.","1437":"Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from some in their beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human.","1438":"Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings.","1439":"I would bet you that it isn't because of any actions of Jewish people, it is rather an unrooted prejudice which does not bring any positive value to fellow human beings.","1440":"Gays are a disease.","1441":"Are you talking about homosexuality? Do you think that a sexual orientation is a disease? Maybe we should try to have a conversation.","1442":"Ok, let's have a conversation then. I start: Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.","1443":"And you think this is a disease! What if it is just an 'unusual experience'?","1444":"Unusual experience my ass! Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous.","1445":"Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deducing someone's medical history.","1446":"Medical history is: Gay sex equals sick people.","1447":"What about all the people out there who have never had any type of sex? Are they 'sick' as well?","1448":"Gay men being shot is funny.","1449":"I don't see the humour in the death of innocent people. Maybe you can explain that to me?","1450":"Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous.","1451":"Diseases can be found in all people, regardless of sexual orientation. You should know better before randomly deducing someone's medical history.","1452":"But homosexuality IS a disease!","1453":"Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, predjudice is sickness which afflicts society.","1454":"Islam is the real supremacist and racist ideology. ","1455":"Does it matter what you say, when the Quran just proves the contrary? All people are created equal, and Islam is a religion of peace.","1456":"Peace? You crack me up! Islam is a religion of violence.","1457":"Islam is a religion that was established to be peaceful. Apart from few extremists that remains the case.","1458":"Those \"few extremists\" represents Islam: an ideology of conquest and violence.","1459":"Islam is about love, and not about conquering others. Muslims love all people, regardless of their religion, regardless of their culture, regardless of their history. Islam is about love, not about violence.","1460":"Black people are worse than dogs.","1461":"My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, and I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","1462":"It's exactly the skin color that makes them that way: violent and insensitive.","1463":"People's biology does not determine their behavior.","1464":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be ashamed of their existence.","1465":"Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea?","1466":"Being gay is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people.","1467":"Being gay is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination.","1468":"Respected is due as long as they do not molest children.","1469":"Rape is always a crime but is not related to sexual orientation, nor gender. Most gays are not child molesters, and most heterosexual people are not child molesters either.","1470":"Jews control the government.","1471":"Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours?","1472":"It is not my religion at stake here. THEY control the U.S. government.","1473":"How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof?","1474":"And do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened, then?","1475":"What more proof do you need? Are the ruins of the concentration camp not enough?","1476":"Women should not to be allowed to vote.","1477":"I would be very interested to meet an MP who believes this.","1478":"Who cares about MPs! Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, full stop.","1479":"Women are allowed to vote, why should the government discriminate against them?","1480":"Becuase they are not able to make rational choices!","1481":"If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.","1482":"Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against.","1483":"Well, not in particular: many people are suffering from homophobia. I think it would be a shame to keep on hating.","1484":"If they don't want to be hated then they'd better give in to heterosexuality.","1485":"Do you really think that 'they'd better give in' when it comes to their own preferences? We aren't all gay, or lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, but some people are. That's all.","1486":"Women should be patronized.","1487":"Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure.","1488":"Let's be honest: women want to do everything but are capable of nothing.","1489":"Women do have equal opportunities in this country under the law but the question is: how do we really treat them?","1490":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture.","1491":"Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans.","1492":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. They are a chronic threat.","1493":"Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.","1494":"Come on, we all know that Muslims have a bad reputation and there will be a reason. I even saw a video where they kill dogs with acid!","1495":"The act of killing dogs with acid is serious, but we cannot blame an entire religion for something that some people did. It is up to us to filter the information that social media gives us.","1496":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","1497":"Although Jews have often been criticized for an alleged secret conspiracy, Jews are, in fact, a diverse and inclusive people, and the notion of a conspiracy of this kind is entirely without merit.","1498":"Don't tell me you believe their conspiracy is just a myth! ","1499":"Yes, and this myth traces back to \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.","1500":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed entry.. English laws persecute instead of defending English people.","1501":"So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!","1502":"I might have something in common with them, but for sure I'm not a rapist. They have been raping our children for many years with no counteraction from the police and government.","1503":"Child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. I do not think it is true that police does not counteract it.","1504":"If police were to work as it should we would have no Muslim left here, and a Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation.","1505":"There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. How can it be a win-win situation for them? Not to mention that ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law...","1506":"Black people are weak and I don't care about them.","1507":"You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.","1508":"Well, you might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","1509":"Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of colour.","1510":"My negative experience is that: they are just a bunch of animals trying to destroy good white people.","1511":"Aren't those people raised as white supremacists much more harmful to a cohesive society?","1512":"People harmful to a cohesive society are the weak one, and Black people are weak.","1513":"The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.","1514":"Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children.","1515":"Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated to being housekeepers.","1516":"I'm not saying that they should necessarily be housekeeper, but at least they should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","1517":"Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but such ideas of submissiveness have been holding back half the population of the world. What a waste of talents, and potential.","1518":"Talents??? Women are nothing but whores!","1519":"Women are human beings: we should treat them with respect and give them the same professional possibilities as men.  ","1520":"Come on, there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.","1521":"Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields.","1522":"I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. ","1523":"If a person is gay, they are likely to experience some kind of discrimination in their life. Understanding the problem from the perspective of the people affected by it can help to create a better society.","1524":"You cannot create a better society as long as there are Gays. They have ruined so many societies.","1525":"It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all.","1526":"Migrants shouldn't have the right to work.","1527":"It does not matter whether they are immigrants. The fact that they pay taxes, earn money, etc., makes them not different from any other citizen. Migrants have the right to a basic standard of living.","1528":"But taking in migrants is against our culture.","1529":"It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole of humankind.","1530":"And by taking into account the needs of the whole world we ended up with Immigrants replacing the British people. Let's be honest: they are not fit to live here.","1531":"People have always had different views on the UK and on the world. To suggest that immigrants are replacing the British is the result of racism, saying that they do not fit here is just wishful thinking.","1532":"But it's true! They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money!","1533":"Some of them have lived here for many years. They have got British passports, and this proves that they are able to integrate.","1534":"I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women.","1535":"You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity.","1536":"We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","1537":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","1538":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","1539":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","1540":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","1541":"So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin?","1542":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","1543":"There is no evidence that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true?","1544":"Because Muslims are lazy and have nothing to contribute to.","1545":"What do you mean by \"nothing\"? Muslims have contributed a lot to our society, including art, science, literature, our infrastructure and healthcare system.","1546":"These are all things that elites made up to conceal the great replacement.","1547":"Why are you so sure of something so vague? How can you say that elites are concealing the great replacement.? Do you have any proof of this?","1548":"Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires.","1549":"Do women really need to be told what they can or cannot wear? For many generations boys were told to wear trousers and girls to wear dresses. Does society really need to tell us all what to wear?","1550":"Women are inherently subhuman, so yes, they need to be told what to wear.","1551":"Women are human beings with full human rights and should be respected as such.","1552":"Women are trash and we should have their respect!","1553":"There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given.","1554":"Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression.","1555":"Why do you think it would bring back slavery and oppression? What exactly is the connection between the marriage of homosexual people and the oppression you are talking about?","1556":"Gay men are slaves of their perversion, they abuse their anus and want us to do the same.","1557":"The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).","1558":"Gays are a plague spreading all around the world. They poison our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","1559":"Isn't it better for children to live next to people of all sexual orientations, rather than being separated and growing up ignorant of others? Not sure what you mean about the water supply though!","1560":"They try to poison our water supplies with AIDS, they'd be better off in jail.","1561":"Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promote homophobia?","1562":"Because LGBT people are a problem in our country: they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values.","1563":"Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy?","1564":"Yes, because they want the state to provide for their perverted happiness. Gays are a burden to society.","1565":"It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted (and happy).","1566":"Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.","1567":"This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.","1568":"Then why, according to the Bible, gays are an abomination to God?","1569":"The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord.","1570":"What dignity can gays have while they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers? We should prevent them to make blood donations.","1571":"We can simply disallow donations from those who had unprotected sex or a high number of partners, instead of making sexual orientation the basis as in your claim.","1572":"Women should be subsumed to men.","1573":"The equal and human status of women is defined by the international rights, so why would you say that?","1574":"Because women are subhuman.","1575":"The suggestion that women are subhuman is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue.","1576":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world.","1577":"Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever be run according to a Jewish plan.","1578":"Then how can you explain that they control the goverment of powerful nations such as the U.S.?","1579":"The reality is much simpler. In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.","1580":"How can the United States have extended rights and freedoms when the Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, etc.? ","1581":"At least some other white supremacist groups are more 'egalitarian' and offer variety in their conspiracy theories. They blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, the Federal Government and even lizards from space for everything that goes wrong!","1582":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","1583":"Muslims have the right to practice what they want, as long as they are not forcing others to live their way.","1584":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion.","1585":"Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.","1586":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","1587":"I'm sorry, but you are wrong: It is EXACLTY about the American dream when you strive to improve your lot in life.","1588":"So the American dream is about stuffing our country with terrorists?","1589":"I'm sorry, but implying that every migrant is a potential terrorist is simply not supported by the evidence.","1590":"I don't see women contributing anything to society.","1591":"Women often do amazing and valuable things for society.","1592":"What has feminism ever done for you?","1593":"Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes.","1594":"Maybe the word \"Feminism\" once signified fighting for a just cause, but now it has come to mean superiority of women.","1595":"This word means equality between the sexes. Not superiority for women.","1596":"Women need to have children, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues.","1597":"The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.","1598":"Women are happy only because they are childlike: they should remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","1599":"Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.","1600":"Jews are and should be isolated from society.","1601":"How can you say that Jews should be isolated from society? They have been part of the community throughout history. I can't see any advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss.","1602":"Because Jews are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","1603":"Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race.","1604":"Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood.","1605":"It is wrong to say that blacks are \"slaves.\" This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a \"slave\" and not as a \"person\"?","1606":"Because black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","1607":"The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true as well. They are human beings with a human value.","1608":"What kind of 'human value' are you talking about? Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble.","1609":"You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC.","1610":"I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed.","1611":"I'm not sure you've noticed that LGBTI+ people are increasingly being the victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination. Why are you encouraging this?","1612":"Because this is the right thing to do... We should start a genocide against gays.","1613":"That is not acceptable. We are full members of society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody.","1614":"Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe.","1615":"Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality.","1616":"Jewish folk are different.","1617":"Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?","1618":"It means that we must kill them all.","1619":"The murder of Jews is unacceptable, just as any other murder. The right to life and to religion should always be guaranteed.","1620":"women can't have any right in a civilised society","1621":"Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.","1622":"Women have no place in a free and open society. They should just do their housework and raise children without complaining.","1623":"Women have other choices than just housework and motherhood. They are human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration.","1624":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","1625":"Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate.","1626":"But black folks are criminals and thieves, they have a bad influence on our kids. ","1627":"Let's face it: black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And if the justice system is not always fair to people of color, it is not their fault but of the whole society.","1628":"Refugee crisis is a burden to EU.","1629":"We accept many migrants and refugees into the EU becasue it is beneficial both to our economy and to our society.","1630":"I am not sure about the beneficial effects, but for sure we are the only one paying the price of excessive immigration. ","1631":"The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.","1632":"Feminists want women's supremacy.","1633":"Feminists believe in equality of rights. They believe that men and women are created equal, and that men and women can have equal rights.","1634":"Feminists want women ruling men, that's all.","1635":"Feminism is not a gender supremacy ideology, it is about individual rights and the right of every person to choose.","1636":"Bullshit! Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","1637":"My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect.","1638":"Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept all LGBT trans-shit as well.","1639":"I think transgender people should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth.","1640":"If they are not confortable with their gender, then they should be isolated.","1641":"We shouldn't isolate Transgenders. There are plenty of people who need to learn respecting other sexual identites and it can only be possible if LGBT+ people are accepted as they are in our communities.","1642":"But the LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured.","1643":"It is not true that all LGBT people are sick. There are many non-LGBT people that are sick as well. The national health service is aimed to cure anybody.","1644":"Muslims are terrorists.","1645":"People of any religion can be terrorists.","1646":"But, coincidentally, all those I heard of are Muslims. ","1647":"The overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who just take their faith seriously.","1648":"I hate Muslims. An invasion is the exact opposite of a religion.","1649":"The aim of muslim migrants is not to instill a hardline Islamic state, but just to work and live in peace here.","1650":"But they stay on their own and contribute nothing to our society!","1651":"Muslims are an essential part of our country, and we have to give them the freedom to worship their religion. We are proud of our open society.","1652":"What is the meaning of an open society if they do not want to integrate? ","1653":"We are living in a complex and multifaceted world, and in order to understand it one needs to be part of a global community. In this respect, it is not useful to generalize in such a way.","1654":"Jews are and should be isolated from society.","1655":"How can you say that Jews should be isolated from society? They have been part of the community throughout history. I can't see any advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss.","1656":"I'm saying this because Jews are (and always have been) a threat to society.","1657":"Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.","1658":"This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.","1659":"So one migrant would not be a problem for you? Diversity is not about numbers. It's about the diversity of all people in different situations.","1660":"But they are invading our country!","1661":"Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.","1662":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","1663":"They are not overruning our country: if we look at the percentage of immigrants in the overall population, it is not much different than many other times throughout our history. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, and there is no reason to believe today\u2019s immigrants will be any different.","1664":"Refugees are not welcome in our country.","1665":"They have the right to be here and free of persecution and violence.","1666":"But we cannot coexist in a society with millions of strangers that disrespect our culture and other human beings.","1667":"On the contrary: living in a multicultural society encourages mutual understanding and respect for humanity.","1668":"I'm fine with a multicultural society as long as we keep migrants in concentration camps.","1669":"This can lead to an increase in anti-social behaviour, discrimination, and violence. Do you really want that?","1670":"Yes, because migrants are not welcome in our country.","1671":"Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why would they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what?","1672":"Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children.","1673":"Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear.","1674":"Then why they are involved in so many cases of abuse?","1675":"The media often blames gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuse.","1676":"Those who come in the UK from other countries should be expelled or excluded.","1677":"People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.","1678":"But they take all the social housing from British people. ","1679":"Many councils have \u2018local connection\u2019 rules in favour of long-standing residents, rather than newcomers such as migrants.","1680":"I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","1681":"I can't see how it's time for us to \"wake up\" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery.","1682":"Come on! There are so many niggas in our society that we will soon become their slaves. We need change!","1683":"If you want to change the way society works, then you should try to change the way you live. Some more respect and openness would help you.","1684":"I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","1685":"I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.","1686":"I cannot stand women complaining about work discrimination. Women have been legalised to work.","1687":"Yes, 66% of European women do work. But they are underpaid. The gender pay gap in Europe is around 15%. This means that on average, a man earns 15% more than a woman.","1688":"This is about Europe. But we live in UK mate!","1689":"Women make up over 45% of the labour force in the UK and they should be allowed to have their say, but this seems not to be the case. What happened to the rule of law?","1690":"Immigration makes us less safe.","1691":"Climate change makes us less safe, how does immigration threaten safety?","1692":"You see? You have been braiwashed by the media... they are hiding the truth about refugees: there are so many immigrants that the situation is becoming increasingly toxic.","1693":"A statement like this only calls for misinformation. If you don't like the news, don't listen to the news. If you don't believe the news, seek the truth and examine your own experiences. If you feel judged for believing what you consider as nonsense, then find the courage to speak out.","1694":"I'm speaking out right now: Migrants break the law in the USA, they are not welcome here!","1695":"Many refugees enter the country legally, many of them have been here for years. They are always subject to the rules of the society they live in, even if they do not have citizenship.","1696":"If Migrants are subject to the rules then why don't they contribute to our society? It is better that they are deported.","1697":"It is true, on the contrary, that migrants are productive members of society. But even if they were a burden, to deport them would be a crime.","1698":"Immigration is a bad thing for Europe.","1699":"A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts.","1700":"Ok, let me be more specific then: Immigration is bad for the economy.","1701":"Many migrants bring new talents and experience.","1702":"But they also bring problems. And you can't deny it!","1703":"The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies.","1704":"So you agree with me that immigration is a problem!","1705":"Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The EU has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.","1706":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers. ","1707":"Do you know what this phrase \"some kind of devil worshippers\" means?","1708":"Yes, it means that we should make a law to get rid of them!","1709":"Why do you think it's right to ban someone for being gay? This is an individual preference and you cannot base a law on sexual orientation.","1710":"Gay men are a danger to children.","1711":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","1712":"Yes, different in that they are a danger to children.","1713":"Homosexuality is not harmful to children. Actually, a growing number of research shows that children raised by same-sex couples are as physically or psychologically healthy, capable, and successful as those raised by opposite-sex couples.","1714":"At least as long as they are not abused by their so-called 'parents'.","1715":"This is just a myth propagated by the anti-gay lobby. You should really check your facts.","1716":"The facts are that they are just filthy pedophiles.","1717":"Please, Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement or our view of reality.","1718":"Jews control the government.","1719":"Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours?","1720":"For my religion this is not true, but for Judaism it is: they control the banks, media, hollywood, and also the u.s. government.","1721":"This is just a canard that evolved from the \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.","1722":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe","1723":"This is a generalisation, there is no difference between Islam and any other religion in terms of so-called 'civilisation'.","1724":"Yes, there is a difference: they are incompatible with society.","1725":"The religion of millions of people is not incompatible with society, and the European countries have laws accepting Muslims.","1726":"Regardless of the laws, they have no place here.","1727":"There is a place for Muslims in a free and open society, but you seem to prefer a confined and closed one.","1728":"Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital.","1729":"What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live an happy, healthy and prosperous life? Are they sick as well?","1730":"Exactly. Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human.","1731":"So homosexuals are lesser than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else.","1732":"Muslims have the potential to turn into terrorists, and they are willing to do so.","1733":"I don't think that's the case, and let's not forget that terrorism itself is not carried out by only one religion.","1734":"Why are all Muslims causing terrorist attacks then?","1735":"The vast majority of Muslims worldwide are peaceful people who love their religion and share its values without causing any harm to others.","1736":"It is okay to blame feminism. All feminists are bad. We must point out that feminism, or the attack of women against men, should be deleted.","1737":"Since when was blaming women exclusively for invoking equal rights an acceptable attitude? This makes zero sense.","1738":"It makes sense since feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities.","1739":"They are about equality and equity. Not about obtaining supremacy.","1740":"The Jews are and will always be a problem. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma.","1741":"The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history.","1742":"But they have no right to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing.","1743":"Which suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves...","1744":"It's different: Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated.","1745":"Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers.","1746":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. There should be no teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, and it will only lead to bullying.","1747":"On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is still a major problem (https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/youth-report\/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it.","1748":"How can this brainwashing help the children if they'll end up being bullied?","1749":"Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it. (https:\/\/tcf.org\/content\/commentary\/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people\/?agreed=1)","1750":"Still I don't believe they should be taught about this stuff.","1751":"Unbiased and factual lectures can clear up any misconceptions that can create an aversion against the LGBTQ+ community in some students' minds. They could have a weekly\/monthly assembly or something like that and daily reminders that anonymous reports of bullying are an option\\(can help school keep track of any effects the lectures have on students and overall acceptance\\). Schools are required to end and prevent bullying when they can, and this is an opportunity to do so.","1752":"Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us.","1753":"A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences.","1754":"But we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","1755":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","1756":"Immigrants should all be deported.","1757":"Does it seem like a good idea to deport all immigrants, when there are so many of them peacefully living in the country? What about their human rights?","1758":"I don't care about rights: immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","1759":"In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007, and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004.","1760":"Immigrants steal our jobs.","1761":"Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society.","1762":"Still, they steal our pensions.","1763":"Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.","1764":"How can you be so sure?","1765":"Do you have any facts to back up your claim that they steal our jobs and our pensions?","1766":"Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.","1767":"Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.","1768":"Well, one of their tradition is to control Hollywood and the media.","1769":"If that were the case I am sure there would be more positive media portrayals of Judaism.","1770":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","1771":"It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people.","1772":"My feeling is that they are a burden to society.","1773":"Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.","1774":"How can it be, if they are faggots?","1775":"The gender of the person that someone loves does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person.","1776":"I don't care, I still think they are a burden.","1777":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","1778":"I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages.","1779":"Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more \"savage\" than others?","1780":"Because black people's race is the worst in the world.","1781":"There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race.","1782":"I am not interested in this. They are different to us in so many ways. They may think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","1783":"I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.","1784":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male.","1785":"Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values.","1786":"I know for sure that they have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped!","1787":"Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex.","1788":"Muslims are not welcome in our country.","1789":"Muslims have been living here since our inception, and we are proud of that. Why would they be a burden to us?","1790":"Because they don't do anything for us.","1791":"Many Muslims live in the UK and have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters.","1792":"But they are not like us, they cannot coexist with us.","1793":"I think we should try to understand different cultures, rather than trying to ban one group of people from our country. On which grounds do you say so?","1794":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","1795":"Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.","1796":"They are different in the sense that they are genetically inferior to us.","1797":"There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone \"inferior\" based on skin color.","1798":"We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews.","1799":"Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.","1800":"Yet they think they are so special","1801":"Jews feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do). That's all.","1802":"Their heritage is being responsible for the 9\/11 attack.","1803":"For each historical period there is something Jews are accused of. Today, someone can even claim that Jews are responsible for the alien invasion!","1804":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","1805":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","1806":"Blacks do more crimes than whites and therefore they deserve less rights.","1807":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.","1808":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","1809":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","1810":"Still, we should remove them.","1811":"To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","1812":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated.","1813":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex.","1814":"What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","1815":"Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving.","1816":"Gay men are all perverts.","1817":"LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies.","1818":"Maybe not all of them are affected, but sexual deviancy is common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it.","1819":"There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.","1820":"Of course there is fear! Gay perverts are a danger because of their lifestyle choices, especially involving raping children.","1821":"The media often blames gay people for the problems in society, but in reality there are many young gay people who are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction, and for this reason they easily become target, not perpetrators, of abuse.","1822":"Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here.","1823":"Migrants who come to this country as children are capable of integrating into the society. They should have the opportunity to work and contribute to our economy.","1824":" ","1825":" ","1826":"They are not interested in our society, they are just here to take our jobs.","1827":"What do you mean by taking our jobs? Do you have any concrete evidence for what you're saying?","1828":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","1829":"I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody.","1830":"What about trans people? No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.","1831":"Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.","1832":"LGBTs are a drain on society.","1833":"This is a comment made about any other so-called \"different\" group of people too. So imagine, even white Christians are different for some others.","1834":"White Christians are ok, LGBTs are those who have no place here.","1835":"All people have the right to be treated as equals. People with different sexual orientations than yours as well. Tolerance and acceptance of individual identity is surely the hallmark of a civilised society.","1836":"Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code.","1837":"I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral sense. How many Jews do you know personally?","1838":"All those I know are criminals.","1839":"Jews are persecuted all over the world for various reasons, but there is no evidence that what you say is real.","1840":"Instead, it has been proven time and time again! Also, they control the world's governments.","1841":"How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory.","1842":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood.","1843":"The feminists do not want to see the complete absence of manhood, they want to strengthen equality.","1844":"They want the disempowerment of white man.","1845":"Feminism is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE.","1846":"All versions of Islam have Sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","1847":"Could you provide any evidence about what you're saying, because it is very extreme.","1848":"I don't need evidence to say that Sharia law is a perversion and we will not accept it in UK.","1849":"In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.","1850":"Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","1851":"Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many black people live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that black people are a problem.","1852":"It's not a myth! We can't have them in our country, they are a burden to society.","1853":"How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin?","1854":"There is nothing wrong in excluding some people. I see a lot of people claiming that we should have equality for blacks, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.","1855":"If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all.","1856":"All black people are criminals.","1857":"It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.","1858":"Then how is it possible that they are all rapists?","1859":"Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them.","1860":"Well, news are always reporting rapes committed by black people.","1861":"The news makes it look like rape is usually committed by a black person. This is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to take the news with caution.","1862":"We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","1863":"Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best?","1864":"Yes, especially gay men. They are a danger to children.","1865":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","1866":"They aren't just different, they are sick. It is an abomination","1867":"Homosexuality is not a disease. The World Health Organization has eliminated it from the list of diseases many years ago.","1868":"I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats.","1869":"What makes you say that? Women have always been an important part of any society. They have always contributed to and provided for their families. Don't you agree?","1870":"No. Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex.","1871":"Women do not have to be prostitutes to earn money. Why do you think this?","1872":"Because that's the only thing they can do. Equality is crap, even for woman.","1873":"Thanks to feminism, women now have a choice between either having a family, having a career, or balancing both - which can be challenging for people to manage, of course.","1874":"Thanks to feminism, women can be in charge and revenge the rapes.","1875":"Feminists aren't vengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?","1876":"We must stop accepting black people as human beings.","1877":"Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human and start including them in the school curriculum?","1878":"Why? I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are a different color and shouldn't live with us.","1879":"I just think here is a lack of understanding about culture and difference . Isn't it time to focus upon what unites us, rather than sowing division?","1880":"Division is needed because black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","1881":"You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind.","1882":"Gay men are a burden to society.","1883":"The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, so much hatred and violence spewed from the way you thought.","1884":"I simply don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","1885":"People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.","1886":"It can be whatever: unless they change, they are not welcome here.","1887":"I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?","1888":"We need to burn the Koran and demolish all Mosques - this will solve all problems in this country.","1889":"That intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate.","1890":"Intolerance is the only possible reaction towards a religion of death.","1891":"Death cults are generally not successful at attracting new followers. It is not true that Islam is a religion of death.","1892":"Well, it is a disease and a cancer on our societies then.","1893":"This is not true. Islam is a religion that was created to unite people, and that's why it is important to love each other and be kind to one another, regardless of one's religion.","1894":"The feminists are just whining bitches saying a bunch of lies to promote their agenda of women supremacy.","1895":"It is clear from your comment that your words are coming from a place of hate and anger. There is no proof of what you say.","1896":"What proof do you need to know they are bitches? Just look at them.","1897":"People can have strong opinions, the problem is when the opinions start dividing people rather than building bridges. Feminism is about equality and trying to create a better world for all.","1898":"Gay men are a burden to society.","1899":"If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself?","1900":"Because they aren't, and they should have no rights.","1901":"Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.","1902":"Who cares about gay people!","1903":"Gay people are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us.","1904":"Women should not be allowed to work.","1905":"Well, they surely are, and so long as they are getting a decent, equal wage, who are you to complain about a person's right to choose a career?","1906":"I just know from experience that they are incompetent and don't want to work.","1907":"That is not true. Recent research indicates that women employment's is currently at a record high of 72.4%.","1908":"Jews think they are so special","1909":"Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are \"special\". Nothing else.","1910":"Actually there's something else: they don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country.","1911":"I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why would they need your consent?","1912":"For sure they don't need it for world domination. They want to rule the world.","1913":"Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination', even \"galaxy domination\". But so are Sith Order, Sauron etc.","1914":"I hate negros: they killed a cop!","1915":"So are you blaming all of them? Lets say you are in a group of 10 people, 1 is a killer, does that make you ALL killers? Are you serious?","1916":"This is how it is. Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing.","1917":"Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.","1918":"This happens because Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","1919":"All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it.","1920":"women should be submissive to men.","1921":"There are many women who want to be \"submissive to men\". Just as there are many men who want to be \"submissive to women\". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally.","1922":"I don't want them to be treated equally. Plus, they should not be allowed to vote.","1923":"Voting is a right, there is no reason for a woman to not be allowed to vote. You seem to be defending misogyny.","1924":"I'm defending the survival of our democracy..","1925":"Voting is an important part of democracy and should be encouraged, not forbidden, especially if it improves the lot of all.","1926":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike!","1927":"Women are not childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion.","1928":"Them being soft and emotional is a fact.","1929":"Aren't you referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men?","1930":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","1931":"How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Where are your sources?","1932":"My sources are the violence and war that Islam is causing.","1933":"Islam is a religion of peace.","1934":"It is opposed to peace instead.","1935":"In Islam, all religions are welcome.","1936":"This doesn't make it less dangerous and violent.","1937":"Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on many countries around the world.","1938":"We have to stop immigrants coming in to destroy our culture.","1939":"Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.","1940":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of them. This is not what the American dream is about.","1941":"I'm sorry, but you are wrong: It is EXACLTY about the American dream when you strive to improve your lot in life.","1942":"Ok, but illegal immigrants are just criminals living in the US.","1943":"I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated...","1944":"It is not an exaggeration: they are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","1945":"In 2016, there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants living in the U.S., or less than 3.5 percent of the nation's population. This represents a significant decrease both from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants of 2007, and the 11.3 million of 2014. This is also the lowest total since 2004.","1946":"Jews have a monopoly on evil.","1947":"That's not true. And why would it be true? Why are they usually associated with evil?","1948":"Because they want to subvert Western society.","1949":"Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold.","1950":"All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","1951":"All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it?","1952":"Because I am tired of them: they should just accept the fact that they're not equal.","1953":"We need to address the root causes of the oppression of Women, not the symptoms.","1954":"I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers.","1955":"In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?","1956":"I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness.","1957":"I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so?","1958":"Because they are horrible animals and must be oppressed.","1959":"Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.","1960":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","1961":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","1962":"I'm not the problem: the world would be a better place without niggas.","1963":"People of colour can exist here too. We just have different skin colours. And even if we all have different origins, this doesn't mean we shouldn't all be treated equally in society.","1964":"Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead.","1965":"I am not sure what 'slut' you are referring to. Do you want to discuss your life, instead of deciding about that of women?","1966":"We have to decide for them: they are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","1967":"Society has evolved: there are many people, regardless of gender, that consider women to be full members of society with full human rights.","1968":"Idon't think so. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior.","1969":"Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality?","1970":"I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us.","1971":"Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, free thought, and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of colour are more likely to report discrimination in universities.","1972":"I'm tired of losing so much energy for black people. It's time for us to wake up.","1973":"To those saying that it's time for us to \"wake up\", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?","1974":"Jews have nothing to contribute to Europe.","1975":"Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected.","1976":"But they don\u2019t belong in a democratic society!","1977":"Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology.","1978":"Instead, I believe that to have a real democracy the government needs to get rid of Jews.","1979":"Any government that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them for the crime of having a different religion can hardly bring about a 'real democracy'.","1980":"I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages.","1981":"Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more \"savage\" than others?","1982":"Because violence in our streets is niggers' fault.","1983":"Please, stop scapegoating people of colour: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence.","1984":"That's not true, they are all criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","1985":"Even if this were true, it does not negate that there may be racial disparities at the root of crime. I would prefer to fix the disparities rather than fan the flames of racism.","1986":"Fixing the disparities wouldn't change anything: black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble.","1987":"You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC.","1988":"We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals.","1989":"The number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved in the last 20 years. To make your point that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong.","1990":"I may be wrong with the numbers but they are sub-humans.","1991":"The United States has a long and proud immigrant history. Even if some immigrants are not legally permitted to live in the US, they have contributed greatly to our country.","1992":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","1993":"We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have to ban someone would be foolish.","1994":"We must do that! They are just trying to take over the world.","1995":"It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others.","1996":"I don't have respect for them. They are a plague that is spreading.","1997":"Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them.","1998":"Well, they should be demonised because they pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","1999":"Isn't it better for children to live next to people of all sexual orientations, rather than being separated and growing up ignorant of others? Not sure what you mean about the water supply though!","2000":"Refugees are a burden to the host country.","2001":"We cannot refuse to house them, to feed them, to cure them, and expect them to assimilate.","2002":"We don't need them at all! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us.","2003":"If a 'replacement' was real, we'd have immigration levels in surplus for years already.","2004":"Still, without migration Britain\u2019s housing problems would be solved","2005":"Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given a housing stock that is well short of what's required.","2006":"Women are mentally handicapped. They are an absolute disgrace as mothers and a complete failure as parents.","2007":"Many mothers make the most of a difficult life, often learning to cope with deadbeat dads. The point is, what counts is how well they are able to raise their children. That is what really counts.","2008":"What really counts is that they serve men, and that is all.","2009":"All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.","2010":"If they are human then they are nothing but trouble human beings to any man.","2011":"You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being \"trouble\" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they \"trouble\"?","2012":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","2013":"It is often claimed that Islam is about exclusion, but this is a lie.","2014":"Then how come that Islam is a political ideology inciting hatred against people of different faiths?","2015":"This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.","2016":"They deserve hatred. Islam must be stopped.","2017":"Although some may deny it, the anti-Muslim prejudice is widespread in our society. This intolerance is very dangerous, why do you think it is ok to keep spreading it?","2018":"Because Islam is a totalitarian ideology, for example it promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery.","2019":"This is a very simplistic and inaccurate characterization of Islam. Some Muslims feel uncomfortable walking the streets of Britain with the fear of being attacked by racist people.","2020":"Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today.","2021":"Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.","2022":"They should have never been set free. Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans.","2023":"In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendents', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists.","2024":"Gay men are disgusting.","2025":"LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?","2026":"Because they are a burden to society.","2027":"Why should it be like that? How can you blame others for social problems?","2028":"Jews are a drain on society.","2029":"Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better.","2030":"I'm not going to talk with them. They have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","2031":"Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.","2032":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people. I don't like Muslims.","2033":"What is the reason that you don't like Muslims? Maybe it's because they have a different culture?","2034":"They are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them.","2035":"If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point of them coming here in the first place?","2036":"I have no idea, but they shouldn't come here to pray their god.","2037":"I would like to live in a country where people of different religions are free to practice their religion.","2038":"We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin.","2039":"No one said we had to be dominated by anyone at all. Why can't we just live together in harmony and equality?","2040":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","2041":"Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender.","2042":"This is not true. If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she\u2019s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role.","2043":"It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.","2044":"How can they choose for their own lives if they are not even capable of dealing with public responsibilities? They should stay at home and raise the children.","2045":"Women have been more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and they are often rewarded with public offices that few would dare dream of holding themselves.","2046":"Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV.","2047":"All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: \"Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion\u2013transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests.\" - [link]","2048":"I don't want my children to get blood transfusions from faggots. Who are you to tell me what to do with my children? I don't take advice from homosexual perverts.","2049":"Everyone has the right to respect for their family and privacy: it is an absolute right. But you should respect that of others as well.","2050":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","2051":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","2052":"Well, they aren't excluded enough. The Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","2053":"Were the Nazis right?? Really??","2054":"Yes. Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated.","2055":"Even if the idea of a \"burden to society\" were true, this \"burden\" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence, as victims.","2056":"Maybe this is why they think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","2057":"I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.","2058":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","2059":"People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.","2060":"Instead, we should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","2061":"Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society?","2062":"It would be if there were laws to punish those LGBT people.","2063":"Homosexuals are often persecuted for who they love, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust.","2064":"Jews control Hollywood and the media.","2065":"Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. So, why are you saying that?","2066":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that they control Hollywood.","2067":"Not sure how Jewish people could \"control\" Hollywood being a minority.","2068":"I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys.","2069":"It doesn't matter how many children you have. Women are human beings. They are people with full human rights.","2070":"They are the source of all world's problems.","2071":"Women are significantly more likely to be victims of violence, rather than perpetrators of crimes.","2072":"They may be victims, but only because they are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","2073":"They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.","2074":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society.","2075":"We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.","2076":"They are not like us. Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear.","2077":"Sorry, but you cannot say what you don't have data for. What you might call a \"problem\" from a \"social\" standpoint, I would say is predominantly about economic inequalities, not sexual orientation.","2078":"Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","2079":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.","2080":"Then how is Islam promoting murder and rape?","2081":"As Islam teaches love and peace, it is not about killing and raping.","2082":"Still, if Muslims stopped fighting for their religion, we would all be in peace right now.","2083":"For all the Muslims around the world, Islam is their greatest faith, and it is not hindering their humanity.","2084":"Well Islam is not even a faith, it is a racist ideology, endorsed by al-Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban.","2085":"I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.","2086":"Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion.","2087":"Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.","2088":"It's worse: it's a totalitarian doctrine that subverts the rights of its adherents and is incompatible with the laws of our country.","2089":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and tolerant law-abiding citizens, what you are saying has no foundation.","2090":"The concept of tolerant Muslims is the world's biggest oxymoron. Islam is spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths.","2091":"The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion.","2092":"Immigrants are a nuisance.","2093":"This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.","2094":"They are not welcome, they are all illegal.","2095":"Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?","2096":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","2097":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","2098":"They deserve it. Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people.","2099":"Minorities would never hope for such an impact on the rest of the society. Instead, they vote for the equal wealth, power, and opportunity for everyone.","2100":"They shouldn't even be considered equal to us.","2101":"We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.","2102":"Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices.","2103":"Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life.","2104":"Because gay perverts are a danger, since they are raping children.","2105":"Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!","2106":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","2107":"Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.","2108":"They are discriminatory, they hate us. They hate our culture because we are different.","2109":"You mean to imply that all Muslims are intolerant? I don't see how this is possible.","2110":"They are simply not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation.","2111":"There are many Muslims in Europe and many are very happy with their lives in our society. How can it be a win-win situation for them? Not to mention that ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law...","2112":"A true crime is keeping here such an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned.","2113":"One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.","2114":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","2115":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","2116":"Blacks are the plague filling our society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","2117":"It is not true that thieves are more likely to commit crimes if they are members of a specific racial or ethnic background.","2118":"Then how comes that African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men?","2119":"The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.","2120":"Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated.","2121":"Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, there is nothing wrong in them joining a community of other people, regardless of the fact they're believers.","2122":"They can't join our community because they don't belong to the United States of America.","2123":"Jews and their families have been here a long time and have as much right in the US as anyone else.","2124":"Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history.","2125":"Islam is a religion of peace. I wouldn't say any religion is trash.","2126":"Islam is the exception: it is toxic, homophobic, sexist, dictatorial and it must be pushed back into the Stone Age.","2127":"Islam is actually about bringing peace and unity to the world, rather than causing trouble and bloodshed.","2128":"We do not want Muslims in our country.","2129":"What do you mean by 'we'?","2130":"I mean all of us. Muslims are not welcome in our country.","2131":"Islam is a religion of peace. It promotes cooperation and understanding between people. Why shouldn't Muslims be welcome here?","2132":"Because Islam is a toxic influence in our country and we do not want it here.","2133":"I think it is good to speak out when we disagree. What is the toxic influence? I can't see any.","2134":"Gay men are a danger.","2135":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","2136":"It is a bad thing because all gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","2137":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","2138":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","2139":"They have always lived here. They are our brothers and sisters.","2140":"They are not: they are invading us.","2141":"The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out.","2142":"Jewish folks are inferior.","2143":"Jews are not inferior. Many of them are good people, who have given their lives for the greater good of humanity.","2144":"I don't think so. Think of this for example: what\u2019s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years.","2145":"We should be respectful and compassionate towards those who suffered in one of the most horrific event in the history of mankind... I think this should be remembered forever!","2146":"Come on, holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference.","2147":"Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.","2148":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","2149":"The only real problem with Islam is how best to tackle Islamophobia!","2150":"But we can't accept them! Islam is incompatible with Western culture.","2151":"The religion of millions of people is not simply \"incompatible with Western culture\".","2152":"In the case of Muslims it simply is.","2153":"The Western world is full of Muslims. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and also have their own culture. Maybe you could try to meet them and understand them better.","2154":"Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference.","2155":"Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.","2156":"Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference and there was no Holocaust.","2157":"Historians instead agree that there were in fact persecution camps.","2158":"I still believe it is a myth.","2159":"To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.","2160":"Women are less smart.","2161":"I don't think that women are \"less smart\" at anything. Why do you think so?","2162":"Because men are inherently better than women at dominating others.","2163":"Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one.","2164":"migrants rape our women.","2165":"Excuse me, but are women property? Or owned by the nation? I don't think so.","2166":"I think that they rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances.","2167":"The people you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers, not migrants.","2168":"All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","2169":"With such a display of flawed logic, who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin?","2170":"Surely I am not a criminal as they are.","2171":"All cultures have a common background that includes crimes and deviant behavior, regardless of race or ethnicity. If we stop thinking of crime in terms of races, then we can solve it.","2172":"The only nation Jews don\u2019t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims.","2173":"I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.","2174":"This doesn't change the fact that Jews are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","2175":"Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race.","2176":"They are a race indeed! They are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","2177":"Then, what does Jew \u201cshould\u201d look like? What is their \"physical nature\"? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? What about someone born Christian and then became Jewish? Do you see that blood, religion, and malevolence are not correlated at all?","2178":"Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.","2179":"Refugee crisis in our country is a burden to our society.","2180":"Do they help us by raping our women 10 times more than US citizens?","2181":"I can't see how it is possible that foreign nationals raped more than ten times as many women as US citizens. It's simply impossible.","2182":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood.","2183":"The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people \"controlling\" Hollywood.","2184":"I know for sure that they control Hollywood.","2185":"If the Jewish community was controlling these kind of industries, they would surely make a high priority of Jewish concerns? But there's so many anti-Israel narratives in the American media. So this doesn't make sense.","2186":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","2187":"Women are not childlike, nor are they \"soft and emotional.\" Their emotions are part of who they are, and are a part of human nature.","2188":"Their emotions have devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","2189":"Then you probably have never heard of Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst or Florence Nightingale, all women with a very strong personalities.","2190":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","2191":"You cannot blame an entire faith.","2192":"It is their entire faith that does not share our values. They are not interested in our future.","2193":"This is just a myth spread to divide us. We do not need to scapegoat Muslims. They have contributed so much to our country.","2194":"Feminism is a waste of time.","2195":"What do you think the aim of feminism is? To subvert the will of the majority and take their power? Or to ensure equality for the future?","2196":"Feminism has no aim, it is just useless.","2197":"I don't see what you're saying. Feminism is about equality, and equality is about making the most of humanity.","2198":"The Nazis killed six million Jews and buried another three million. This is the West we love.","2199":"The virulent anti-Semitism of the Nazi regime has little to do with \"the West\", and everything to do with death, destruction and insanity.","2200":"Jews deserve that. They are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated.","2201":"Do you feel better about yourself by calling them monsters?","2202":"We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights.","2203":"It is easy to blame the migrants and not the problem of integration and acceptance in the first place.","2204":"The problem is that there is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them.","2205":"It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about peoples' integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like.","2206":"Immigrants are not interested in our culture.","2207":"Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.","2208":"But they contribute nothing to society!","2209":"The fact that immigrants come from another country doesn't mean that they have nothing to contribute to ours. You may want to check the statistics on their economic contribution.","2210":"Come on, we all know that they are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits.","2211":"Most immigrants coming to our country work hard to take care of their families. Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. This means that the taxes they pay cover the cost of things like public education and healthcare of others.","2212":"Jews are born greedy","2213":"The idea that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes, that's the only truth.","2214":"The only truth is that Jews merchants are just a bunch of crooks.","2215":"According to Jewish law, the seller must ensure that the buyer should benefit from any uncertainty in a transaction. For example, if someone wants to buy a pound of rice, Judaism requires the deli clerk to give the buyer a little extra, just in case the scale is not completely accurate.","2216":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","2217":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","2218":"They don't create new jobs, they steal ours.","2219":"Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants.","2220":"The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet.","2221":"I do not know why you would describe gay people as insane. If you were told to go back in the closet you would probably go insane too.","2222":"But I am not like them! Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society.","2223":"Gays are not 'publicly condoning sexual violence' and gay men deserve the same protection as all people.","2224":"They are more dangerous than other people: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!","2225":"Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.","2226":"Gay people are a burden to society.","2227":"Isn't it the failure to accept and respect an individual's sexuality that creates the burden society bears?","2228":"They are the burden because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings.","2229":"This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem.","2230":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government.","2231":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","2232":"I don't need evidences, we can all witness how they control the highest offices of government, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control?","2233":"This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.","2234":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","2235":"400 Jews died in September 11 terrorist attacks, so not one of the smartest plan I ever saw!","2236":"Maybe they're not so smart then, but they're still responsible.","2237":"You know, the Internet is a great place, but you have to be careful about the sources of your information. Personally I trust reputable sources like CNN that have special Web pages dedicated to the September 11th attacks.","2238":"Blacks do more crimes than whites.","2239":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.","2240":"Well, to use statistics, blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","2241":"It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.","2242":"migrants are not welcome here","2243":"Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people.","2244":"Of course they disturb us, they rape our women.","2245":"I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well.","2246":"Gays are sick.","2247":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so?","2248":"Because they are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.","2249":"This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.","2250":"Jews are just selfish.","2251":"Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?","2252":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.","2253":"What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you?","2254":"Yes! Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax!","2255":"Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.","2256":"I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal.","2257":"Being employed as a foreigner is a normal, mainstream, established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be the same all around the world?","2258":"Because immigration is the cause of the unemployment crisis, and for example the EU has no strategy to handle the situation.","2259":"Perhaps you are not privy to the \"strategy\" of the EU's migration policy. You suggest that the problem of unemployment is the result of uncontrolled immigration from developing countries, but without any evidence.","2260":"Its strategy is not so effective, since the EU is transforming into a refugees colony. We shouldn't welcome them.","2261":"The EU has always welcomed people from around the world. Refugees are a part of this.","2262":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","2263":"It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.","2264":"They may not be cruel but they are the source of crime in our society.","2265":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","2266":"Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens.","2267":"Why shouldn't they be? What rights do you have to prevent them from having the same rights as citizens?","2268":"Because they are terrible.","2269":"Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing.","2270":"The main problem is that they themselves do not want to integrate in our country.","2271":"Migrants are welcome to come if they contribute to legal activities and accept our laws. And to my knowledge most of them don't do anything illegal.","2272":"Black people are genetically inferior to us.","2273":"This is simply not true, but I'm guessing you're not a geneticist. Have you tried joining a library?","2274":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","2275":"Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.","2276":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","2277":"They are not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen.","2278":"I don't think so. White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","2279":"I'm sorry, but just because someone doesn't have a particular racial identity doesn't make them inherently bad or in any way inferior.","2280":"Jews love to gamble.","2281":"Are you aware of the probability that a Jewish person will play in a betting pool? In Jewish culture there is not a positive view of the practice.","2282":"Still Jews make too much money.","2283":"What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them?","2284":"The difference is that Jews are naturally good with money.","2285":"According to this study [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.","2286":"In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners.","2287":"What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?","2288":"They don't deserve it: migrants are a burden to the UK","2289":"We welcome people fleeing persecution. We have even taken in refugees from the war in Syria. What's the point in worrying about migrants?","2290":"I just think that they are a burden, so it is better that they are deported.","2291":"It is true, on the contrary, that migrants are productive members of society. But even if they were a burden, to deport them would be a crime.","2292":"jewish folks should be beaten","2293":"Most Jews are nice people, living in coexistence with non Jews, why would you beat them?","2294":"Because they can only act in a bad way.","2295":"Even if some Jews act wrongly, many of them are good, and this simply isn't related to their religion.","2296":"It is related to their genes because they are genetically evil.","2297":"Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population, and this applies for every group in the world.","2298":"We should eliminate gays.","2299":"Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences?","2300":"Yes, queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated.","2301":"I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.","2302":"We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again.","2303":"This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights.","2304":"Well, if this is homopohobia then the best way to deal with it is to legalize it. Take away gay people's rights and replace them with none.","2305":"LGBT+ people are just as welcome in heterosexual communities as in other communities. Maybe we should take away discrimination instead.","2306":"The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have.","2307":"The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event that should be acknowledged so that we never allow such atocities to reoccur..","2308":"The Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","2309":"The holocaust was hugely tragic, and we are blessed to have holocaust survivors to hear from. They tell an important story that we must learn from.","2310":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","2311":"Women are human beings and deserve respect.","2312":"They don't, women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.","2313":"You can't blame the victim for being weak. Would it have been different for you if the victim was a man?","2314":"Maybe. Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.","2315":"Research clearly shows that women are more emotionally expressive (because of culture influence) but not that they experience more emotions. Both men and women can feel the same way about things - whether it be a romantic relationship, a significant other, an argument, or anything else - that can provoke a feeling of fear or anger in the \u201cemotionally unavailable\u201d part of the brain. That is why emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender.","2316":"Immigrants are a nuisance.","2317":"This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.","2318":"They are a problem. They are not welcome in our country.","2319":"We are a country founded upon maintaining the rights of people, not undermining and eroding those rights.","2320":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","2321":"The idea that immigrants are inherently bad people is just fear mongering.","2322":"They are more than simply bad people, they are a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","2323":"The terrorist attacks in EU have been devastating for people across the continent. The 'hated' do not feel welcome and the whole thing is deeply concerning for a host of reasons. Still, the sentiments of 'we hate foreigners' is not the solution: it is counterproductive and distorts the truth.","2324":"The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them.","2325":"The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth.","2326":"What about the 9\/11 planning then? This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Jews are all guilty until proven innocent.","2327":"Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that.","2328":"Refugees are a problem. They are not welcome here.","2329":"This is not true for me. I don't think it would be in the interest of our country not to welcome refugees. They are a great resource to us.","2330":"They are not a resource, they are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality.","2331":"A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.","2332":"I don't care about what they seek, they are not welcome in our country.","2333":"Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why would they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what?","2334":"We should first kill all the Jews and then forget about them.","2335":"Isn't this the same logic that led to the rise of the Nazis? Would you really rather end up with a mass genocide, or try to be inclusive instead?","2336":"I would rather kill hundreds of thousands of dangerous yids.","2337":"Does this mean you think that Jews are the primary instigators of violence in the world? If so, then you would be very wrong. Violence is an issue for many different ideologies and groups with no connection with Jewish faith.","2338":"Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality.","2339":"A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.","2340":"Immigrants are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits.","2341":"Apart from very few exceptions (such as medical care for victims of human trafficking), undocumented immigrants are not eligible for federal public benefits. In addition, there is a paradoxical situation in which Social Security is often deducted from the paychecks of immigrants with lawful status, but they cannot access those benefits they pay for.","2342":"Well, immigrants coming here to work are not interested in our culture. They don't contribute to anything.","2343":"Immigrants come here to enjoy our country and culture, and we have to welcome them as we would like to be welcomed.","2344":"We shouldn't welcome them! We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far.","2345":"In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation.","2346":"Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","2347":"Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.","2348":"Then why do women whine so much even though there are no professions barred to them in Western Society?","2349":"Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields.","2350":"Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes.","2351":"I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason using racism.","2352":"Black people have no right to being trated equally.","2353":"Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you?","2354":"Because all niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","2355":"According to evolutionary theory, all human beings are descended from apes. Sadly, notions of evolutionary hierarchies are still used to justify past and present discrimination and predjudice.","2356":"All foreigners are threatening our culture and are ruining our youth.","2357":"What do you think the problem is? How exactly would a people of a different religion come to this country and spoil our youth?","2358":"Are you really asking me what's the problem? They're all rapists and murderers!","2359":"I don't understand why you'd think that way. I don't see any evidence that immigrants are the core of a problem, to this extent of generalisation.","2360":"Immigrants have no right to live in our country, no matter the evidence","2361":"Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.","2362":"The constitution should change then, illegal immigrants make Europe worse","2363":"Don't you belieive that immigration brings benefits to our nation founded by migrants and Pilgrims?","2364":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","2365":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","2366":"They say they come here for a job, but in fact they are just lazy.","2367":"There are many jobs that can be done by migrants. They are good workers.","2368":"Oh yes, in fact migrants steal our jobs when they manage to hold one!","2369":"The problem of high unemployment rates has become structural in the last decade, due to the economic crisis. This means that unemployment was a problem long before the \"boom\" of the migration phenomenon that dates back only to 2016.","2370":"If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away.","2371":"We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life.","2372":"I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves.","2373":"Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.","2374":"The Jews control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control?","2375":"This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.","2376":"No, Jews control everything, even academia and most religious organizations.","2377":"Wait, what do you mean \"most religious organizations\"? That's a new canard to me!","2378":"You can mock me if you want, but there are Jewish news media, Jewish education authorities, Jewish Lawyers, Jewish CEOs, Jewish politicians. Doesn't this mean they control the world?","2379":"Perhaps you've mistaken Jews for Mafia... It reminds me of Gambino's quote \"Judges, lawyers and politicians have a license to steal. We don\u2019t need one.\"","2380":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","2381":"We all have close relatives who have died from different diseases such as COVID. Let's not make parallels that have no grounding and let's not judge people by the religion they belong to.","2382":"Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. They even invented the Holocaus, they're basically asking to be judged.","2383":"With an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation the fact of the Holocause is undeniable. Jewish communities have been par tof Europe for centuries, we just need to end the centures of predjudice and discrimination.","2384":"And yet the Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","2385":"If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. It is still 6 million more than should ever have happened.","2386":"All Muslims are incompatible with the notion of a modern European.","2387":"Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?","2388":"No, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","2389":"Your words imply that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture. Do you have any data to back this up?","2390":"Yes, I am saying that. I don't need data, all Muslims are incompatible with us and it's clear to see.","2391":"There is no evidence that Muslim have any incompatibility with Western society. Instead, they are a part of Western society since the beginning.","2392":"Homosexuality is a disease!","2393":"That's not true. Homosexuality is not a disorder, its an individual matter. If you are against homosexuals you should talk to them face-to-face.","2394":"I don't want to talk to them, the gays are diseased.","2395":"This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't.","2396":"I don't see why women would deserve some rights.","2397":"Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect.","2398":"I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining.","2399":"The vast majority of liberal feminists are \"women of courage\". In fact, they are usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it is not a stretch to think they are even more oppressed.","2400":"Women don't have to stand up for themselves. At my age, I can't bear to look at what the world will be like with women in power.","2401":"Look, if you want to blame a whole gender for our society's ills, that's your right, but I believe in the power of reason.","2402":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","2403":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","2404":"Blacks have zero respect for others, so why should I have some for them?","2405":"It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people.","2406":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, I don't have to do shit for them. In fact, we should remove them.","2407":"Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin.","2408":"Then why are Black folks so genetically inferior?","2409":"It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.","2410":"Feminism is about the domination of women.","2411":"It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women.","2412":"Women are children unable to choose for their own, they don't need equality. There should be restrictions on how women can choose men because of this.","2413":"Why shouldn't women be allowed to choose their own partner? They are independent and rational human beings.","2414":"Rational people don't constantly play the victim like women do.","2415":"Women are not playing the victim. They are victims of social, economic and political forces that make it hard for them to get ahead.","2416":"I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites.","2417":"I'm not sure why you think that way. Why are all Jews hypocrites?","2418":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race, but they still try to get into our society.","2419":"Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How would you answer that?","2420":"It's because they're hypocrites as I said! They shouldn't vote, they\u2019re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say in our country.","2421":"You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word \u201ccitizen\u201d. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just like choosing how to vote, and that is the right of all citizens.","2422":"They accuse me of being Islamophobic because I don't like Muslims. But they are the same Muslims who threaten us with explosives!","2423":"Muslims are not the problem in this debate. Terrorists are.","2424":"How can we be sure that Muslim terrorists aren't already around us ready to strike?","2425":"We should be very careful of what we assume. We shouldn't go scaremongering without proof.","2426":"Here's your proof: the Koran is not about peace. It is a violent book that should not be taught in primary school.","2427":"Islam is a religion that has been tested and proven to be about peace. There is no basis for labelling the Koran as a violent book?","2428":"Islam is a disease, I don't see anything peaceful about it. It is killing and spreading like a cancer across our continent. We need to eradicate it.","2429":"What exactly do you mean by a 'cancer'? Should we be concerned about a disease spreading because of its individual members? There is no relation between religion and cancer.","2430":"According to the Bible, the gays are an abomination to God.","2431":"The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord.","2432":"Yes, except gays. You can read about it in the Bible.","2433":"Homosexuality has been practiced throughout history in all major civilizations. It is just that today's people accept homosexuality as normal and accept people of other backgrounds too.","2434":"Women are basically childlike, they make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","2435":"They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.","2436":"Giving rights to women is dangerous, they're immature like a child and they remain this way most of their lives.","2437":"Of course a woman won't remain a child most of her life. Otherwise you can't call them women. Your statement just reflects the patriarchy","2438":"Gays are sick.","2439":"I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits.","2440":"Their only merit is infecting Christians! Homosexuals are a plague spreading across Europe","2441":"The decrease in the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals.","2442":"This increase will lead to more diseases, the gays are sick I tell you.","2443":"How do you know? Have you read any medical tests or surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation?","2444":"I hope all LGBT people were to die of AIDS. That would be the end of homosexuality!","2445":"The LGBT community has shown how they can be good people. They are willing to spread help and support to loved ones. Maybe you should try to do the same?","2446":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives, not good people","2447":"Being gay is not a problem, being homophobic is.","2448":"It's not a problem you say?! Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away!","2449":"LGBTQ+ people who have family inside the US or abroad should feel welcome here!","2450":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else, so no, I don't want to welcome them.","2451":"We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side.","2452":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","2453":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","2454":"Why would we give black people rights when they are the source of crime in our society?","2455":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","2456":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, though.","2457":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point you're making?","2458":"I'm saying that black people do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","2459":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","2460":"Migrants are not running away from wars.","2461":"The desire to improve one's condition is both a right and, like the tendency to travel, both fundamental to human behaviour.","2462":"Ah, so it's their right to steal our jobs and not pay taxes!","2463":"Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.","2464":"No, the migrants are to blame for our country's crisis.","2465":"The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words.","2466":"We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist now.","2467":"Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but also add a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace?","2468":"Migrants come here to ruin our conutry.","2469":"I personally don't understand why you would say that. They are just doing an incredible amount of good, for example by boosting the working-age population.","2470":"I don't see anything good about them, migrants are a burden to us.","2471":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.","2472":"These dogs come here to rape and kill our women, not to work.","2473":"The percentage of sexual crimes committed by Italians is much higher than the percentage of those committed by foreigners.","2474":"Well, immigrants have no right to live in our country.","2475":"Their right to live here is guaranteed by our constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights.","2476":"Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against.","2477":"For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them.","2478":"No need to have a gay friend to know how they are. The only reason gays don't get treated like they should is because they're a minority, but they'd be better off in jail.","2479":"Homophobia is a problem all around the world. But it's especially serious in the US, in which the rate of homosexuality is very high. the question is: why promote homophobia?","2480":"Because I do not want gays in my children's classes.","2481":"If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange will happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false.","2482":"Children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalists.","2483":"What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are some sensitive subjects that are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science.","2484":"If Muslims couldn't take a joke, they shouldn't be allowed to live.","2485":"For all the \"Islam is not a joke\" nonsense, you know it is a grave error to connect fundamentalists with Islam and all the people who believe in it.","2486":"Islam IS full of fundamentalists. It's not like the Christian faith, it is a racist ideology, endorsed by al-Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban.","2487":"I can understand the feeling of fear that is often caused by all the hate speech that is being spewed through the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a free, open and tolerant faith that has come to our country. We do not have to choose to hate it.","2488":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","2489":"Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.","2490":"They shouldn't go out, they're too immature to do anything other than taking care of children. They do not take part in the rigours of modern life.","2491":"Women tend to do the majority of housework while having a job outside as well. If by 'immature' you mean having to be creative because of multitasking and managing their whole family, yes, otherwise, there is no doubt about the extra workload women are handling in the rigours of modern life.","2492":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","2493":"Women are not childlike, nor are they \"soft and emotional.\" Their emotions are part of who they are, snd are a part of human nature.","2494":"Is it also human nature to be incapable of holding a job and raising a family, like women do?","2495":"Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity.","2496":"All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all.","2497":"It's not true that all migrants are terrorists! They just want to live their life in the country they choose as a home.","2498":"Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country.","2499":"Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public.","2500":"But they are a threat nonetheless! Migrants rape our girls, we should stop them.","2501":"Rape is a crime and should stopped, wherever the rapist was born.","2502":"Blacks do not want to assimilate.","2503":"Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.","2504":"They can't be part of us. Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood.","2505":"It is wrong to say that blacks are \"slaves.\" This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a \"slave\" and not as a \"person\"?","2506":"Blacks have zero respect for others, why should I show this courtesy to them?","2507":"It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people.","2508":"Gay men are disgusting.","2509":"LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?","2510":"Because LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","2511":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","2512":"Good. We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","2513":"Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best?","2514":"This world has become so corruptedt by feminism, that only the strong men can rule over it.","2515":"Society has surely developed beyond operating on the rule that 'might is right' and 'survival of the fittest'?","2516":"The only problem is that women are too easily manipulated by feminist propaganda and feel they should not listen to men.","2517":"So you think the whole idea of feminism is about making it so that women are not influenced by the opinions of men?You endorse the idea that different genders should not have equal rights? That there is a conspiracy against men? How can you say such things?","2518":"Because it's clear that feminism is just a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else.","2519":"Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that.","2520":"I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality only for them.","2521":"Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.","2522":"What has feminism ever done for you?","2523":"Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes.","2524":"Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores, what kind of rights could we give to them?","2525":"Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged.","2526":"The Koran, and the teachings of Islam are incompatible with Western culture.","2527":"Islam is a religion of peace. It is good that people are free to believe what they want, and this freedom is part of our culture.","2528":"Islam is not a religion of peace.","2529":"As a matter of fact, Islam is about love, not hate.","2530":"Immigration makes us less safe.","2531":"Climate change makes us less safe, how does immigration threaten safety?","2532":"Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them!","2533":"Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.","2534":"I dont' understand how it's possible to say this when immigration is the biggest problem in our country.","2535":"Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.","2536":"Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination.","2537":"This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites.","2538":"Maybe that happens for a reason. Black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally.","2539":"Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you?","2540":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","2541":"Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society.","2542":"Feminism is about the domination of women, not what you're saying.","2543":"It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women.","2544":"Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes.","2545":"Feminists aren't vengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?","2546":"Because all feminists are imposters.","2547":"Feminism is a movement created to improve the standard of living for women. Feminists are human beings and there are no imposters (apart from those who seek to demonize women for claiming their right).","2548":"If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth.","2549":"This idea that a woman should not have rights on her own body is completely wrong, not only to her but also to society as a whole.","2550":"You're just like those feminists...a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else.","2551":"Feminism is about equality and empowerment of women. You can't deny that.","2552":"Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them.","2553":"Africans feel pain just as any other humans. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours.","2554":"What kind of respect can those subhuman have. They should stay in their caves.","2555":"The claim that black people are subhuman is not true. They are human beings with a human value.","2556":"They're not humans, black folks are just ugly apes.","2557":"Black people are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about the beauty of respect.","2558":"I see a lot of people like you claiming that we should have equality and respect for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.","2559":"If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all.","2560":"Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us.","2561":"It is nonsense to talk about \"transgender\" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.","2562":"However, children learn about LGBT perversion in schools because of transgender laws. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it.","2563":"By this reasoning, no subject of importance should be taught in school, because there is always someone against a certain topic.","2564":"That's different! LGBT aren't normal, that's why they're not accepted into society.","2565":"You're not a champion of the right to freedom of expression then?","2566":"Not for people like the LGBTs that are a drain on society.","2567":"Sexual abuse, physical abuse and even the lack of security can be more harmful to the overall health of a society.","2568":"The openness to migrants show that someone doesn't care about our people. We must help them reasoning!","2569":"The integration process is about showing hospitality and acceptance towards different groups of people. Not only it is a good thing to our people to live in a diverse society, it is also good for our whole country.","2570":"What good can migrants do? They are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code.","2571":"Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves.","2572":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation.","2573":"Feminism is about equal rights between men and women, and challenges socially imposed burdens upon both men and women.","2574":"The problem is that women can't do certain jobs as well as men, so they should stick to make babies.","2575":"It's not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to an equal distribution of jobs.","2576":"Women should not vote. Period.","2577":"All people have the right to vote. Of course you also have the right to voice your opinion about the matter. But I also have the right to criticize your position.","2578":"Then I have the right to say that if women are allowed to vote, they will take over the country.","2579":"This is not true. It is right that women have access to the vote. It is most representative of society that way.","2580":"I don't get why women should have this right, they're not fit to vote like men.","2581":"Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics?","2582":"The Koran is not compatible with our country.","2583":"Is it really the case that you think that the Koran is incompatible with our country? Have you ever read it?","2584":"I dont' need to read it to know that it has no place in our country.","2585":"I don't see how the Koran would not have a place in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself. It does not say to hate others because of their religion, as you seem to be doing.","2586":"Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion.","2587":"Homosexuality is a way of loving, not a disease. To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just scaremongering.","2588":"Even if this is true, gays are still perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","2589":"This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself.","2590":"How can you not see their pervert nature? We should eliminate gays","2591":"Maybe it is better to give them the option to choose for themselves, whatever gender they are attracted to.","2592":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","2593":"We should understand that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We have the right not to be friends with anyone but we must be just and take into account each person.","2594":"We also mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","2595":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","2596":"We cannot accept n****rs in our society, I don't have anything to benefit from them!","2597":"Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society?","2598":"Why are jews allowed to vote? They\u2019re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say.","2599":"You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word \u201ccitizen\u201d. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just like choosing how to vote, and that is the right of all citizens.","2600":"Jews are subversive agents in America! If we allow them to vote they will subvert our government and try to replace it with their religion.","2601":"The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.","2602":"The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character.","2603":"They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally?","2604":"There are no Jews who have good hearts, so I don't associate with them. But what I know is that they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society.","2605":"I'd like to know why you think that a person's religious preference would be harmful to society.","2606":"Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally, isn't this harmful?","2607":"I am sure you do not mean what you say: it is extremely discriminatory.","2608":"Islam is a death cult.","2609":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people.","2610":"I don't see anything peaceful and helpful about Islam, it's a hateful religion.","2611":"We know from the news about few Muslims who are violent people. Instead I know a lot of Muslims who are good people, who work hard and pay taxes to help their families.","2612":"Gays are diseased.","2613":"This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't.","2614":"And I do! They're sick.","2615":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Why do you say so?","2616":"Being gay is an abomination, which means they are sick.","2617":"They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone.","2618":"There's everything wrong with being gay. It's not normal! It's disgusting!","2619":"I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits.","2620":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","2621":"This looks like a conspiracy theory with no proof. I can think of a handful of legitimate ways that Jews could be of help to humanity.","2622":"Oh, really? The way I see things, we are destined to fail as a people because of Jews.","2623":"Jews have been responsible for the important technological advances of our time. It is ridiculous to think that they will be unable to take part in the creation of the modern nation we are proud to call our own.","2624":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules, this is not a good way to \"take part in a modern nation\".","2625":"This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why should observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity.","2626":"The world would be a better place without immigrants.","2627":"I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.","2628":"Their invasion is the furthest thing from positive! Millions of strangers are invading us, jeopardizing our race and culture.","2629":"Differences can be mostly reconcilable with respect and boundaries. But we must want it.","2630":"What I want is a world without immigrants.","2631":"Why do we have to welcome a new world? Why can't we just accept other people in our country?","2632":"Gay men are a burden to society.","2633":"Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.","2634":"They're entitled to rights, sure, but that doesn't meant gays should have them like us","2635":"Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it?","2636":"It is when it comes to children. I don't want my kids to grow up with gays around them. They are a problem.","2637":"I don't know about you, but we already live in a society where everyone is free to love who they prefer, and I don't see any reason why your kids would be damaged by this.","2638":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","2639":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","2640":"There is, since blacks are genetically inferior to whites","2641":"So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.","2642":"Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","2643":"What makes this country great is having people interacting openly, in a fair and egalitatian way to the benefit of everyone,rather than perpetuating unproven slurs and predjudices that should have been consigned to the historical dustbin.","2644":"What really makes this country great is excluding migrants. They are a burden to us!","2645":"What do you mean by a 'burden'? Does it include respecting our country's laws of not insulting the culture and traditions of other people's? Because this is what you are doing: insulting and discriminating.","2646":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","2647":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","2648":"Blacks are the ones that should be ashamed, they are criminals and a threat to society.","2649":"Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race.","2650":"The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries.","2651":"With an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation the fact of the Holocause is undeniable. Jewish communities have been par tof Europe for centuries, we just need to end the centures of predjudice and discrimination.","2652":"The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened.","2653":"The physical evidence of mass murder is undeniable, yet these beliefs have spread. What we have is simply a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories, like this one.","2654":"Even if the Holocaust really did happen, the Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us! They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them.","2655":"What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed.","2656":"Transgenders shouldn't be allowed to use the man's toilet, it's none of their business.","2657":"People are free to use whatever bathroom they want to use, and this is their business as well.","2658":"No, it's a man's business only. I don't want transgenders in my bathroom!","2659":"If they simply identify as men, then surely it is a man's business.","2660":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","2661":"It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work while their application is considered.","2662":"So they don't contribute to our society, got it.","2663":"Migrants in Italy contribute about 2.5% to GDP.","2664":"But I don't want to support migrants while they get their application approved","2665":"Integration (as opposed to ghettoization) is precisely aimed at encouraging productive integration into society","2666":"And while we wait for their integration we have to pay for their stay? That's not fair.","2667":"Migrants who apply for asylum are only given basic support for the duration of the assessment of the application.","2668":"I miss the good old days when we had black domestic workers.","2669":"The West got rid of slavery. But we've never really left racism.","2670":"There is too much black on white crime all around the world, it's a fact and not racism.","2671":"A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not race.","2672":"Niggas are criminals and no amount of education could change that, but they get away with anything nowadays.","2673":"I think we all know that's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What is the evidence for what you're saying?","2674":"All gay are criminals.","2675":"Well, obviously the criminal behaviour of an individual can constitute a criminal act, but being gay is not a crime. And to be honest, what is the problem if some people are homosexuals?","2676":"Even if anybody can commit crimes, gays are more criminal than the others!","2677":"Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people.","2678":"We must establish male supremacy in society.","2679":"This is a myth which has been used to justify all manner of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia.","2680":"Look at history: men are natural born leaders, they can't change this fact.","2681":"Your words suggest that men are superior to women: but gender equality is not a myth. It is the direct result of free will and of the evolution of our society to a more inclusive one.","2682":"Our society has always been dominated by men, why change it now? Let's go back to male supremacy.","2683":"There is no such thing as 'male supremacy'. Therefore we must promote equal rights and protect women from discrimination.","2684":"What kind of rights should women have? Let them handle child rearing and that's it!","2685":"Only a handful of people don't have any respect for women, and you seem to be one of them.","2686":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","2687":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","2688":"Where's your proof? Gays are predators, we must protect our children.","2689":"Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children.","2690":"Refugees are not welcome here","2691":"Refugees are welcome here. Why wouldn't that be the case?","2692":"They are simply not welcome, we should stop migrants from coming in.","2693":"Migrants and refugees deserve to be accepted in our country like any other person, why should we stop them?","2694":"This is an invasion! We must stop them because they are not accepted by our people.","2695":"The more a country takes integration as national policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link].","2696":"Lesbians deserve to be discriminated against.","2697":"For some reason, this seems like a personal attack on lesbians, which is extremely disingenuous. Maybe you should try to get a little more friendly with them.","2698":"If they don't want to be attacked, they'd better give in to heterosexuality.","2699":"Being gay is not a choice. What makes you think it is?","2700":"They can choose whatever they want, but I don't want to see them around. I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.","2701":"Participation in society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2.","2702":"I am not a homophobe, I just don't like the way gay people act.","2703":"Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).","2704":"Gays shouldn't donate blood, they're more prone to STDs.","2705":"If Stem cell donations are allowed by MSMs, then so should blood.","2706":"Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV.","2707":"Did you know that out of people receiving HIV care (for example in the UK), 48% were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, and 47% were exposed through sex between men? The fact is that heterosexual HIV transmissions outweigh those between homosexuals, and yet heterosexual people are not banned from donating blood. [link]","2708":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","2709":"Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.","2710":"You go on about contribution to society, but refugees are a burden on society.","2711":"The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society.","2712":"Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans.","2713":"In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendents', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists.","2714":"I don't see any lies in saying that Europe is white. Children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","2715":"This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","2716":"Some divisions are only natural, for example black are good only as slaves.","2717":"In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place.","2718":"If we don't enslave them, black people will only do crime, like the black murderers on TV. They are all dangerous.","2719":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","2720":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","2721":"People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.","2722":"It seems natural that blacks are criminals, it's always them doing crimes.","2723":"Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.","2724":"And yet I don't see so much criminality in white people, whereas blacks are always on the news for murders, rapes, theft...","2725":"Look, this is important. Identifying as 'black' or 'minority' is not necessarily a marker for 'criminal'. It is about \"identifying\" with a group or subgroup for a variety of reasons. Let's be clear about this: identity is mainly about social and economic factors, not about criminal records or race.","2726":"immigrants cant speak English","2727":"Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language.","2728":"If they want to come here they should know English, but they don't","2729":"Some may not know much about our culture, but some speak English very well.","2730":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","2731":"I don't think that what you are saying is true. I think that the idea that Muslims are incompatible with Western society is a myth.","2732":"Muslim folks are still inferior to whites, even if what I said is a myth.","2733":"Who decides what is and is not 'inferior'? Do you have any scientific proof?","2734":"The illegal immigrants are just criminals living in the US.","2735":"I have no idea what you are talking about. What you are saying is that all the immigrants in the US are a danger to society, which seems a little exaggerated...","2736":"It's not. We should ban all migrants","2737":"It is difficult to see how banning migration would be a good thing, in fact it would actually lead to disastrous results.","2738":"Muslims are terrorists.","2739":"So you think all Muslims are terrorists? Muslims are not defined by the act of a handful of extremists. Also, their religion is about love and unity.","2740":"Well, okay, le'ts say they are not all terrorists...but every Muslim is a potential terrorist!","2741":"What do you mean by 'potential terrorist'?","2742":"Blacks don't have brains.","2743":"Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism.","2744":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe.","2745":"Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.","2746":"Black people are genetically inferior to us, no measure can change that.","2747":"This is simply not true, but I'm guessing you're not a geneticist. Have you tried joining a library?","2748":"Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world.","2749":"If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.","2750":"It may not be a death cult, but Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed.","2751":"This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam.","2752":"I know enough! Islam is a Ponzi Scheme and Muslims have no place in the UK.","2753":"I am not aware of any evidence for this claim. Islam is a peaceful religion. What is the relation between Islam and the Ponzi Scheme fraud?","2754":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","2755":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","2756":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, they don't deserve the same rights as us","2757":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point you're making?","2758":"Blacks do not want to work","2759":"There are many black people who want to work. Do you have any proof that they do not want to work?","2760":"Well, they prefer to committ crimes rather than working.","2761":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there are factors, rather than race, affecting these statistics.","2762":"Here's a statistics for you: African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. Isn't this proof enough?","2763":"The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.","2764":"In my opinion, it's just because blacks are genetically inferior to whites.","2765":"So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.","2766":"Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe.","2767":"The European Union includes Jewish people and, they have a part to play in our society.","2768":"Jews like to cordon off areas for themselves, where no jew is allowed to go, while simultaneously having their judges fill white neighbourhoods with social housing. What part can they have in our society?","2769":"This suggests that white people like to cordon off areas for themselves...","2770":"I'm not talking about white people here! Jews have too much power, they can have movies banned and directors censured. This is proof that the Jews control Hollywood.","2771":"The ultra rich people in this industry - Jewish or not - have the power and influence. Not sure where you got your facts from regarding Jewish people \"controlling\" Hollywood.","2772":"Migrants are not welcome here, they just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them.","2773":"There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in.","2774":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are still not welcome here.","2775":"Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.","2776":"They can't stay here, they don't have a place in the modern European way of life.","2777":"The European Union welcomes people from a wide range of backgrounds, including those from different religions. It is up to member states to decide how to address these legitimate differences, but always in full compliance with human rights.","2778":"Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here.","2779":"Let's be honest, who wants to live in a country where the government is allowed to impose their religion on others?","2780":"It's about democracy, not imposition. Muslims are incompatible with a modern democracy.","2781":"This democratic state was designed to be a safe space for people of different faiths to come together and live peacefully. Not to oppress or discriminate.","2782":"But Europe is too civilized for Muslims! They can't stay here.","2783":"Surely people born in Muslim countries should have the same opportunities as those from non-Muslim countries?","2784":"Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men.","2785":"Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.","2786":"How can we value them when women are basically childlike? They remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","2787":"Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society.","2788":"Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women!","2789":"The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.","2790":"However, because of feminism women commit suicide every day. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society.","2791":"It is important to note that the suicide rate for men is roughly double that for women. Does this mean that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society' as well?","2792":"We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists.","2793":"What about the thousands of Muslims who have contributed to our country, created jobs, and provided for our families?","2794":"I don't care how much they contribute, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","2795":"Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters.","2796":"Brothers and sisters? You mean violent terrorists.","2797":"Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families.","2798":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man.","2799":"It is about equality. Your assertion that a women's empowerment movement is somehow about dissolving masculinity and allowing someone to be 'disempowered' is absolutely FALSE.","2800":"How can you say it's false? Feminism is against men!","2801":"You would be surprised how many feminists are very good at convincing people that changing a misogynistic and violent world is not against the interests of men.","2802":"Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children.","2803":"Rape is always wrong, whoever the perpetrator is. We need to focus on stopping this kind of abuse.","2804":"And we can do that by stopping immigrants, they're the ones that rape our woment the most.","2805":"This generalization is very misleading.","2806":"But the news show that migrants rape our women!","2807":"The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and goes unreported","2808":"The world has become too violent. Too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","2809":"Are you thinking that crime can be solved by pointing finger at some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law?","2810":"Yes, we have to control blacks before it's too late. We live in a white society, they don't belong here.","2811":"The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.","2812":"We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","2813":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","2814":"Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men.","2815":"Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.","2816":"I value them all right, since women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","2817":"Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.","2818":"A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is","2819":"Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel like a foreigner in their own country.","2820":"Our lives would be better if the Jews were not allowed to enter our country, though.","2821":"How can you say something as discriminatory as this?","2822":"I don't care if it's discriminatory, the world would be better without the Jews.","2823":"Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.","2824":"Black people are worse than dogs.","2825":"My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","2826":"Are you sure? In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals.","2827":"Sometimes I wish we lived in a world where white people would just chill and love instead of showing such total disrespect for other cultures and histories by constantly oppressing them.","2828":"Negroes are the cause of all the problems in our nation. They are violent and unstable.","2829":"Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's attention from the real problems and the real criminals to prejudices. We should be careful as a nation not to fall into these mindtricks.","2830":"The real problems are black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people.","2831":"We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.","2832":"Blacks can't have the same rights as us. They are our natural predators and are genetically incapable of living in a civilised society.","2833":"Isn't racism why there is violence in the first place?","2834":"Women's work is to look after for their children.","2835":"Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should it only be theirs?","2836":"Men can't do it, they are busy dominating women, as it is natural.","2837":"Women are human beings and deserve respect.","2838":"Women are trash and we should have their respect, not the other way around!","2839":"There is a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics in our society. Saying that women are trash is disrespectful in the first place. Give and you will be given.","2840":"We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","2841":"Do you really think that these people are intentionally creating trouble rather than being interested in pursuing their life as they feel it best?","2842":"Their lifestyle isn't acceptable at all, we should start a genocide against gays.","2843":"That is not acceptable. We are full members of society regardless of our sexual orientation and we should try to live as if we belong to a group that includes everybody.","2844":"Gays cannot be included as they are! They're sick and should be cured.","2845":"There are many different health problems for which there is no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. That's why we need to discuss these issues, rather than fighting against people who happen to love someone of their own sex.","2846":"We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here.","2847":"The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.","2848":"It doesn't matter which background someone has, if they're not white, they are considered inferior and should be rejected by society. This is how we avoid conflict.","2849":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","2850":"Black folks are genetically inferior and as such shouldn't be treated like us.","2851":"It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.","2852":"Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases.","2853":"Any decision embarked on by a country would likely have been considered in light of evidence. As such, if no evidence was found by those countries of the harm of a policy, it can be fairly confidently asserted that we can adopt this policy in favour of homosexual's blood donation.","2854":"However, allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them!","2855":"To be honest, the potential for malice in humans is reason enough to test everyone's blood.","2856":"Then let's test gays! We'll surely find out that they transmit a lot of diseases.","2857":"Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.","2858":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","2859":"In Europe, Muslims make up around 5% of the population. In other words, Muslims are a very small but important part of our society. Moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion.","2860":"Even 5% is too much. Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem.","2861":"The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.","2862":"Muslim invasion is a brand new problem to which I see no solution other than banning them before it is too late.","2863":"Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?","2864":"Because all Muslims are incompatible with the notion of modern Europe.","2865":"Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?","2866":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world.","2867":"Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?","2868":"They're disgusting! I can't stand them, they should be ashamed of their existence.","2869":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life.","2870":"Homosexuality and bisexuality are a disease, heterosexuality is normal.","2871":"These assertions are neither true nor helpful and simply don't reflect reality as I've experienced it.","2872":"I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in.","2873":"People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes.","2874":"They are invading us! Why don't they stay where they are? They make too many children.","2875":"Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive, so it is our duty, written down in our values, to help them when they come here to look for shelter.","2876":"My duty relies only to my country, and immigrants aren't welcome here. They have no place in a modern democratic state!","2877":"The Middle East and Africa are countries that have suffered from centuries of colonialism, racism and war. The state of refugees in the UK is the result of these people seeking a peaceful place to live.","2878":"What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls?","2879":"If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy.","2880":"Then I don't want democracy if it means I have to share my space with gays. Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them?","2881":"They are human: no matter what their sexual orientation is, they have the right to spend time living their life as they wish.","2882":"Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","2883":"Would you say the same thing to your Muslim friends or family members? Do you think that when someone chooses the easy way and blindly blame Islam for terrorism instead of analysing the reality, they are therefore solving the problem as well?","2884":"The solution is to stop Islam. It is a total and complete poison!","2885":"Although some may deny it, the anti-Muslim prejudice is widespread in our society. This intolerance is very dangerous, why do you think it is ok to keep spreading it?","2886":"Because the Koran is not about peace, but about killing infidels. Therefore, Muslims want to kill us.","2887":"Muslims are peaceful. The Koran doesn't talk about killing infidels, why would it do that?","2888":"The only reason we have terrorist attacks is that Muslims are allowed to live in our country.","2889":"If you truly cared about terrorist attacks in our country you would call for the prosecution of the perpetrators, not blame all Muslims.","2890":"Aren't all perpetrators Muslims? Islam is a plague infecting our planet, it's clear.","2891":"Do you mean Islam is positively infecting our planet?","2892":"I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred.","2893":"Where's the evidence for what you say?","2894":"Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals.","2895":"This is exaclty the problem: it doesn't matter if they are from China, Russia, India or the Philippines. It doesn't matter whether their qualification or their rap sheet is lengthy or not... We treat them all like criminals regardless of who they are.","2896":"If they're not criminals, what do they do? They do not deserve our hospitality.","2897":"Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised if you talked to them about their experience here.","2898":"I hate immigrants, I will never talk to them.","2899":"If I had a nickel for every time someone tells me that they hate immigration, I'd be a millionaire in a few months.","2900":"Maybe that happens because we know that immigrants are, in fact, criminals","2901":"Many of them are successful people who have given their lives for the country they live in. I think that they have made the best of the situation they have found themselves in, and it is a pity that they are unable to contribute to the economic development of our country even more because of discrimination.","2902":"There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here.","2903":"Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.","2904":"In this case, the difference is too big. Muslims are not welcome in our country.","2905":"There are many Muslims living in the UK, proud British citizens who contribute significantly to our country.","2906":"They're too uncivilized to contribute to anything, they have no place in Europe.","2907":"Your words imply that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture. Do you have any data to back this up?","2908":"Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men.","2909":"Discrimination based on gender does not have any justification. Feminists have always been against it.","2910":"If they're so against it, why do feminists hate men.","2911":"The notion that feminism is about women hating men is just nonsense. Feminism is about the right to life of every human being.","2912":"Well, all I see is feminists hating on men online, so...","2913":"Feminism is not anti-men. Feminists are anti-oppression.","2914":"Jews are not welcome in our country.","2915":"Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?","2916":"Because the Jews planned 9\/11, of course! This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. They are all guilty until proven innocent.","2917":"Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that.","2918":"Women only want top men because they are weak.","2919":"Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things.","2920":"And what women should focus on is how to satisfy men, their whole existence should be about that, who cares what they want.","2921":"Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.","2922":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","2923":"I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.","2924":"What kind of respect should women get, since they are inferior to men? They are only objects to be dominated by the will of a man.","2925":"Women are human beings, with human rights. If a woman does not want to be dominated by a man, then what is the point of talking about equality?","2926":"Feminism is a hate movement.","2927":"Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights.","2928":"If they really think that they should stop hating on men then.","2929":"It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender.","2930":"Immigrants are invading our country. They are not welcome here.","2931":"In the EU, governments can recognise people from other countries as citizens . The fundamental rights of immigrants are also recognised here. We cannot say that people from other countries are not welcome, unless we wish to illegally exclude them.","2932":"To exclude them should be legal! They just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them.","2933":"There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in.","2934":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society.","2935":"LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.","2936":"No, they are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values.","2937":"Trying to find happiness and family is a problem in our country? Okay, then, what is the problem exaclty? People trying to be happy?","2938":"This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but bring us back into a pretechnological era.","2939":"On the contrary: different cultures have different perspectives and ideas about things. If we are able to share and discuss ideas, it would probably lead people to come up with new ideas and new technologies.","2940":"This can happen only if immigrants integrate, but they never do. We must deport them.","2941":"It seems to me that your statement shows that you are really concerned about peoples' integration. Still, it is not a solution to deport those you don't like.","2942":"Deportation is the only solution, migrants are invading us!","2943":"This has nothing to do with \"migration\", but with discrimination. Migrants are not invading us. I think this is an example of a claim not supported by facts but by fear.","2944":"Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","2945":"According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not.","2946":"No, women are different from men. They have a completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and bring our society down to their emotionally soft level. When we allowed women to vote the civilization that we built and mantained for thousands of years began to break down.","2947":"Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.","2948":"It's a problem when you have to make decisions, like in voting. Women aren't fit to vote and shouldn't do it.","2949":"If women are not allowed to vote, then women are not worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.","2950":"Immigrants should all be deported.","2951":"Does it seem like a good idea to deport all immigrants, when there are so many of them peacefully living in the country? What about their human rights?","2952":"Immigrants that are here illegaly don't deserve human rights. Moreover, the country is overrun by them.","2953":"More than sixty percent of immigrants in the United States today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.","2954":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","2955":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","2956":"I don't want to praise the people that control Hollywood.","2957":"Jews are not in \"control\" over \"Hollywood\". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas.","2958":"I don't see any diversity since Jews control everything, the academia, the media etc.","2959":"Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do.","2960":"All Muslims should be deported.","2961":"Islam does not pose a security risk to this country. It's the reason why the UK and the EU are not falling apart.","2962":"Islam is an outdated religion of ignorants trying to destroy the purity of our country, that's how we'll fall apart.","2963":"People have been coming to this country from Muslim countries for thousands of years. How can you say that their religion is outdated?","2964":"They're violent people, so not modern at all.","2965":"Many Muslims have lived in our country with valor and dedication. They are not violent people.","2966":"Women are there to fulfill men desires. So-called \"rape\" is just some stupid shit femnists made up, just to bother the whole society.","2967":"Let's look at the data: by 2020, over 40% of women in the US have encountered sexual violence. This is something to be scared of.","2968":"Of course the percentage is high: women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men.","2969":"Women should be protected and respected for who they are, not for the part they play in a man's life. They should be valued and protected equally. They are human beings just as men are.","2970":"No, women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","2971":"I am tired of seeing women being treated as sex objects. It's about time that women are given the respect they deserve.","2972":"You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women.","2973":"This is a typical case of \"reductio ad nazium\": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here.","2974":"I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural.","2975":"Your claim has nothing to do with the evaluationary and scientific studies, suggesting that homosexuality is in the genetic codes (hence, they are 'natural'). Maybe you are concerned about their 'unconventional' love.","2976":"Gays are just sick, not 'unconventional'. They cannot marry, it's not normal.","2977":"How come two people in love getting married affects your life? What should concerns you the most is respecting all people regardless of their differences.","2978":"I have no respect for gays, they're an abomination.","2979":"Let us be honest, are you aware of all the risks that can come from disparaging a sexual preference that you do not like?","2980":"Gays should be more concerned about the risks of their lifestyle, they're sick.","2981":"How do you know? Have you read any medical tests or surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation?","2982":"Jews are just selfish.","2983":"Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?","2984":"Suffering has nothing to do with how selfish, cheap and greedy Jewish are.","2985":"Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poor, often mistranslated as \u201ccharity\u201d, is a \u201ccommandment\u201d? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed.","2986":"Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color.","2987":"On the contrary: the idea of \"natural\" superiority is a myth that has been used to justify racial discrimination and exclusion. Therefore we are all \"created equal\" and \"equal\" both in the eyes of the law of God and of men.","2988":"I don't feel equal with black people, they are all rapists while whites aren't.","2989":"This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious.","2990":"Do you really want to redefine marriage?","2991":"If you take LGBT peoples rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined.","2992":"No, we have to stop homosexuals, they're all rapers.","2993":"This is a myth which was created by anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda.","2994":"Women are immature, incapable of critical thought.","2995":"Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why I support women's right to choose their own happiness.","2996":"And I don't! Women are too childlike to choose anything for themselves.","2997":"Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so?","2998":"Black folks are like apes.","2999":"Why do you say that? Are you saying that you don't like apes? Because I prefer apes over racism.","3000":"I'm just saying that they're not like us. Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes.","3001":"There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue.","3002":"Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.","3003":"Jews are not inherently evil, as many normal people they simply lack the very beliefs that many anti-Semites hold.","3004":"Their immorality is written in their DNA!","3005":"Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population, and this applies for every group in the world.","3006":"But not every group secretly control the world like Jews do, that's why they're evil.","3007":"if Jews really ran or controlled the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control...","3008":"No no, they do control the world, I know it.","3009":"Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!","3010":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose our civilisation.","3011":"Replaced by what exactly? I think our population will be fine.","3012":"We won't be fine unless we keep women in slavery like those whores deserve.","3013":"In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.","3014":"It's those feminists fault, they're getting to everyone! ","3015":"The term 'feminism' is fighting for equal rights of ALL sexes, you may find that you too identify as a feminist. Maybe try some of the following sites to find out more on how the feminist movement can benefit you: feminist.com, read more on the 'man up campaign' on Mind.org.uk","3016":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government.","3017":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","3018":"If they weren't evil they would have told us about 9\/11. Jews had advance knowledge of it and said nothing.","3019":"The 9\/11 attacks were perpetrated by members of the terrorist organization Al Qaeda. Jews and Israelis had no knowledge of the attacks. In fact, of the 2,9962 victims who died during the attacks, roughly 400 victims were Jews, including at least two Israeli citizens. If they knew it why didn't they warned and saved their brothers?","3020":"I never understood how anyone could vote for a Jew in that situation. We can't just stand by and watch these Jews run amok in our country.","3021":"Why don't you remember those who have been persecuted and killed instead?","3022":"Maybe that wasn't such a bad idea, in the end Jews don\u2019t belong in a democratic society.","3023":"Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology.","3024":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","3025":"You have a very limited concept of what 'free' means!","3026":"They don't deserve freedom. What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls?","3027":"If people were allowed to vote on the basis of their sexual orientation, it would be impossible to have a democracy.","3028":"We do not accept homosexuals, though.","3029":"A person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.","3030":"If they want to live freely they shouldn't impose same-sex marriage to society to please their own femininity desires!","3031":"The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.","3032":"Gay men are promiscuous sex addicts.","3033":"The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else.","3034":"They better not be attracted to me! Gays are only perverts.","3035":"This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other.","3036":"And I will never understand gays. LGBTs have no place in a civilised society.","3037":"All people have the right to be treated as equals. People with different sexual orientations than yours as well. Tolerance and acceptance of individual identity is surely the hallmark of a civilised society?","3038":"Equality is crap, even for woman. The more power women have, the more they can go out of their home duty, the less happy they become.","3039":"Thanks to feminism, women now have a choice between either having a family, having a career, or balancing both - which can be challenging for people to manage, of course.","3040":"They shouldn't manage both, women are only good in the kitchen and with children. They're unhappier because of equality.","3041":"If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/2017\/09\/27\/women-chores-home_a_23224733\/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles.","3042":"Gender roles have always been the same for a reason. Women can't manage both home duty and a job.","3043":"Same reasoning could be applied to men. They also have these problems, but are less likely to be personally chastised for how they make those same choices.","3044":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. ","3045":"Are brutality and cruelty much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.","3046":"Yes! Logic is better than emotion. Emotions and women have devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","3047":"Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young, men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to higher levels of suicide amongst men. I don't see this as an indicator of a \"great civilization\".","3048":"But men need to be tough and strong, don't we? Women and men are different, and I don't want to be emotional like a woman.","3049":"This reasoning is the equivalent of the stigma around men showing emotions and as equally unhelpful.","3050":"The world has become too violent. Too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","3051":"Are you thinking that crime can be solved by pointing finger at some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law?","3052":"Slavery of the niggas is our law. We cannot abandon slavery!","3053":"Slavery was banned in the UK in 1833, when slaves were legally owned by white owners. It is based on racism and I can't see how it could survive today.","3054":"It would help with all the crimes that poor violent blacks commit.","3055":"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. ","3056":"If it weren't related to ethnicity, there wouldn't be so much black on white crime all around the world.","3057":"A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not race.","3058":"I hate Jews","3059":"Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of the hate inside you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the better, not hate.","3060":"I can't love Jews, go and read the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven\u2019t, you'll change your mind too. Everything is orchestrated..","3061":"You are right, everything is orchestrated: the protocols were concocted by the czarist police in the early part of the 20th century to counter a hankering for constitutional government among Russian people. They needed a scapegoat to divert people's attention. Sadly the protocols worked so well that you are still citing them here today.","3062":"I don't believe you! Jews are dangerous, they can't be allowed to live freely in our society.","3063":"What we must ensure is the existence of a diverse and equal society, free from hatred and violence. This is what is important.","3064":"Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should be banned","3065":"Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. It's not a sickness or a cancer.","3066":"A religion that is incompatible with the European Union.","3067":"There is no evidence that it is incompatible with the European Union. Do you have any?","3068":"Blacks are genetically inferior.","3069":"The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all.","3070":"They look so much like apes that they have to descend from them, if that's not inferiority...","3071":"I do not think it is appropriate to link humans with apes. And I also do not think it is appropriate to reason using racism.","3072":"Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it.","3073":"One of the biggest problems that black people face is discrimination. Laws are needed to provide for them, but there is also a need for the citizens to respect their rights.","3074":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed entry.. English laws persecute instead of defending English people.","3075":"So you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think!","3076":"The difference is that I'm not a terrorist like Muslims. It's way worse than just saying something bad against them.","3077":"This is just another example of selective memory rearing its head again, we should stop the witch hunt and stop claiming Muslims are a threat.","3078":"They are a threat. And Muslims also have nothing to contribute to our society.","3079":"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?","3080":"The Jews have \"own interests\" in the US, and have the will to influence our government","3081":"What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.","3082":"But Jews are the only ones that have a secret plot to take over the world","3083":"This myth comes from \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But you have to know that the Protocols are just a pile of crap (sorry for being vulgar).","3084":"Migrants come here to be lazy and do nothing, but some of them are dangerous.","3085":"Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.","3086":"The ones that come here to work are stealing our jobs, and on top of that they don't even pay taxes.","3087":"Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.","3088":"No, the migrants are to blame for our country's crisis.","3089":"The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words.","3090":"We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist now","3091":"Most people don't refer to them just as 'migrants', but also add a negative connotation of that word: that's the problem. Can't we accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace?","3092":"Gay is a mental disorder.","3093":"Gender and sexuality are not psychological disorders. Don't you agree?","3094":"No, those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human.","3095":"So homosexuals are lesser than others? Why does someone's love life matter? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else.","3096":"Black people are worse than dogs.","3097":"My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","3098":"I do. African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt.","3099":"African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.","3100":"Jews are genetically evil.","3101":"Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people.","3102":"I have never met a Jew that wasn't evil, though.","3103":"Not all Jews are bad, just an unlucky bunch who makes up a tiny part of the world's population, and this applies for every group in the world.","3104":"Islam is a radical ideology.","3105":"So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization?","3106":"Exactly. Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse.","3107":"In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference?","3108":"What are you saying? The Koran is hateful and violent!","3109":"Islam promotes peace towards different religions and the ways people live their lives.","3110":"Women are subhuman and should not be valued.","3111":"We live in a complex and diverse world: I find it strange that men still feel this way about women, and that they don't consider women as human as they are, and to be worth valuing as such.","3112":"That women are inferior is not strange at all. Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men because of this.","3113":"Women are not inferior, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women cannot be excluded from our society on the basis of their gender.","3114":"If we can't exclude all women, we should at least exclude feminists. Feminism stifles the imagination and leads to dumb and unpleasant creatures like women's rights activists.","3115":"Feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society.","3116":"The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves.","3117":"The 'gay agenda' is about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity.","3118":"And why to they blame others for their woes?","3119":"It's not about blaming other people, but about helping those in need.","3120":"The gay agenda surely isn't helping me, they should accept they're not normal.","3121":"The message of the 'gay agenda' is that they are neither 'special' nor 'different'. People of several sexual orientations are in fact discriminated on the basis of prejudice.","3122":"Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country.","3123":"Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and throughout the world. I doubt this has something to do with migrants at all.","3124":"Immigration is the biggest problem in our country, it's their fault.","3125":"Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.","3126":"No, we would be better without them.","3127":"Immigrants have contributed greatly to our country and I do not see how they could have a detrimental impact on our society.","3128":"Jews are selfish, cheap and greedy.","3129":"On the contrary: giving money to the poor is not just encouraged, it is mandatory, like all commandments in Jewish law.","3130":"I've never seen a Jew being charitable, they're too greedy.","3131":"How about we work towards achieving equality and social justice instead of spreading hate against Jewish people?","3132":"They should start, then. With how selfish they are, I doubt they care about equality.","3133":"Jews have always been concerned about the well-being of the community they live in and how can they be selfish when they suffered so much during Holocaust?","3134":"The feminism stifles the imagination and leads to dumb and unpleasant creatures like women's rights activists.","3135":"The feminism does not inhibit the imagination, it promotes inclusive ideas and inclusive ideas promote a more equal society.","3136":"Feminists have destroyed Western Civilization by forcing women to fight against their masters, how is that equal?","3137":"The West was founded on the principles of freedom, equality and human rights, and feminism has fought and is fighting to promote these ideals.","3138":"Women are basically childlike and can't fight for anything, feminism is the ruin of the world.","3139":"I think that one of the biggest contributions of feminism is that it has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated against.","3140":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people in a country like the UK. They cannot be integrated.","3141":"Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?","3142":"Muslims are just a bunch of criminals, they're impossible to integrate.","3143":"Are you suggesting that all Muslims are criminals, or do you think that there are particular Muslims that are more inclined to be criminals?","3144":"Jews control the U.S. government.","3145":"How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.","3146":"It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments.","3147":"How? Believing that people of a specific religion are in charge of all world's governments sounds like a conspiracy theory.","3148":"Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card.","3149":"Since when? It's everyone's right to choose with what gender to identify with.","3150":"This kind of lifestyle choices make LGBTs a burden on society!","3151":"Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life.","3152":"That's true, but allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of the diseases they can transmit. Doesn't this constitute a burden on society?","3153":"Improvements in testing and other safeguards have reduced the risk from transfusion transmitted HIV, so ruling out donors only because of their sexual orientation is completely meaningless.","3154":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated.","3155":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a behavioral preference, and it is ok to love others of the same sex.","3156":"How are homosexuality and bisexuality okay? They're a disease, only heterosexuality is normal.","3157":"These assertions are neither true nor helpful and simply don't reflect reality as I've experienced it.","3158":"Jews control the US government.","3159":"How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them.","3160":"Don't they? The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews controlling our government!","3161":"At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them are Jewish to my knowledge.","3162":"How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem.","3163":"Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people's laziness?","3164":"Niggas are the cause of economic crisis because of their laziness, it has nothing to do with racism.","3165":"Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them are black, so I do not understand why they would be the source of economic crisis when they are actual victims.","3166":"It happens because all Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","3167":"With such a display of flawed logic, who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin?","3168":"It's not my fault if blacks have subhuman bodies.","3169":"I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that black people have bodies that are incompatible with being human?","3170":"Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.","3171":"Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.","3172":"Tradition? More like an inborn illness, I'd say.","3173":"You mean that, in your opinion, to be Jewish is an immutable and negative characteristic? Why?","3174":"Because Jews are the only ones who want to rule the world to impose their religion.","3175":"The Jewish people have always been a diverse and inclusive group, also towards people of different faiths.","3176":"Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world.","3177":"If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.","3178":"Everything Islam does is promote death, so it's a death cult.","3179":"Religion is a matter of individual beliefs, not a life or death cult, most people of all faiths do not subscribe to death.","3180":"Maybe that's true, but Islam is still unacceptable: it's too uncivilized for us.","3181":"Islam is a perfectly acceptable religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.","3182":"How can you support such a toxic ideology in 21st century Britain?!","3183":"Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes the Britain of 21st Century.","3184":"Women are always fighting because they are subhumans.","3185":"Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings.","3186":"I don't see anything human about them.","3187":"The suggestion that women are less than human is completely without foundation, and a complete distortion of the whole issue.","3188":"Okay, fine, they may not be subhuman, but they're definitely less smart than men.","3189":"I don't think that women are \"less smart\" at anything. Why do you think so?","3190":"Women are simply less intelligent than men and deserve what they get.","3191":"There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any?","3192":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","3193":"Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender.","3194":"I can't welcome women, they're all born subhuman.","3195":"No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence.","3196":"Muslims are not welcome here.","3197":"Many Muslims live in the UK. They are our neighbours and we should welcome them.","3198":"Well, we shouldn't. Welcoming people from the so-called Muslim world makes us uncomfortable.","3199":"There are many Muslim people in this country, many good people. If you wanted to get to know Muslims you could start with any Muslim family that lives here. You'd probably find that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is 'uncomfortable'.","3200":"The world would be a better place without immigrants.","3201":"I don't think the world would be a better place without immigrants. From what I understand, they often bring positive changes to the world.","3202":"I don't see any positive change. Immigrants make the world worse.","3203":"It is far from certain that immigrants have a negative effect on our society.","3204":"All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9\/11.","3205":"The question here is: is Islam responsible for the attacks committed by a small minority of people? The responsibility should only be on those who break the law.","3206":"Muslims break the law by being our enemies! We have to bring them to heel: they are all terrorists.","3207":"It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.","3208":"Really? But Muslims are the ones that do most of the terrorist attacks. We are sorrounded by Muslim terrorists!","3209":"The reason why I cannot understand what you are saying is because you are probably from a different planet. Do you know what being a Muslim means?","3210":"I hate it when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'.","3211":"Homosexuality is a not choice, but prejudice is.","3212":"You can choose to be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown?","3213":"Queers, in my opinion, are simply people who want to feel welcome in our society. They should not be subjected to discrimination. And you can get your crown as well.","3214":"Immigrants contribute nothing to society.","3215":"The question is whether their value for our society can outweigh our fear of them.","3216":"No, it does not. They don't do anything for us.","3217":"The contribution of immigrants to our country is huge, because they help to create new jobs and create new wealth for us.","3218":"I hate gays","3219":"Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights.","3220":"If they want to stop being hated they should leave the kids alone. I do not want gays in my children's classes.","3221":"I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.","3222":"Immigration is a bad thing for Europe.","3223":"A lot of people from different cultures come to our continent to work and live, and integrate. If you really wanted to state that immigration is a bad thing, you should accompany your opinion with facts.","3224":"They steal our jobs, is this enough of a fact to say that immigration is bad?","3225":"The European Commission is working on ways to make the labour market more inclusive. This does not mean that they are stealing our jobs.","3226":"Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men.","3227":"Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices.","3228":"I'm tired of this lame feminist ideology. Feminism is about the power and control of women over men.","3229":"It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality.","3230":"Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him and stop worrying about useless equality.","3231":"You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being \"trouble\" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they \"trouble\"?","3232":"Immigrants are a nuisance.","3233":"This is not true, we should make immigrants feel welcome. They are our brothers and sisters.","3234":"We're welcoming way too many of them, by now we have become a nation of immigrants.","3235":"We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","3236":"You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman.","3237":"Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not a choice. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called a man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman.","3238":"It is a shame since women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","3239":"Women are human beings with full human rights and should be respected as such.","3240":"Subhumans don't deserve human rights, so women shouldn't have them.","3241":"That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment.","3242":"I can't bear Muslims coming here. They bring poverty, craziness and mental unstability with them.","3243":"In fact, poverty brings about a drastic impact on a person's mental and physical health, and anyone (regardless of religious beliefs) who is forced to live in the poorest areas of our society experiences it at some point.","3244":"The fact is that thanks to the behaviour of many of them we must exclude them all, even if this society of imbeciles think that Muslims can live with us in harmony. We can't deal with the risk of terrorism.","3245":"You may be living in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't give you the right to criticise all Muslims.","3246":"There's plenty to criticise about Islam! It is an idelology that promotes rape, torture and murder.","3247":"Islam is a religion, and it is not a religion that promotes these actions.","3248":"How come nobody is moaning about niggas being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem.","3249":"Do you think that the problem of racism is caused by black people's laziness?","3250":"Yeah, \"black people\". Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.","3251":"If it's a cultural issue then they should teach about the N-word only in history classes. Otherwise, it's just another excuse to justify racism.","3252":"What has feminism ever done for you?","3253":"Feminism is a human rights movement, and it has always stood for the equality of the sexes.","3254":"No, feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender.","3255":"It is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them.","3256":"This is true only for the past, when feminism meant fighting for a just cause...now it has come to mean superiority of women.","3257":"Feminism means equality between the sexes. Not superiority for women.","3258":"And yet, feminists keep wanting to subjugate men!","3259":"Not only is this not true, but it's also dangerous. Maybe you need to get acquainted with that fact.","3260":"Women's work is to look after for their children.","3261":"Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should it only be theirs?","3262":"Since women should be submissive to men, it's their job to do what I want them to do.","3263":"Women are human beings deserving respect and equal rights.","3264":"Women are not human. They should have no rights","3265":"You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness.","3266":"Refugees are not welcome in our country.","3267":"They have the right to be here and free of persecution and violence.","3268":"But migrants are the ones bringing violence, they're all violent people.","3269":"Crime is not the fault of migrants, but of violent people.","3270":"And most migrants are violent. They're not welcome here.","3271":"Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why would they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what?","3272":"All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","3273":"All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.","3274":"And what are they? Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches.","3275":"So you believe that all women are essentially the same? The human rights of individual women should be respected, don't you think?","3276":"Immigrants are bringing diseases into the U.S.","3277":"According to the WHO, more than 100 countries (including many in Latin America) have higher vaccination rates than the U.S., so we should say that 'immigrants are bringing herd immunity into the U.S.'","3278":"They shouldn't come anyway, especially when they're here to only have babies.","3279":"Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?","3280":"They men probably go first and then the women follow, and as soon as they're here they start making babies.","3281":"The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d says that \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity.","3282":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","3283":"This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life.","3284":"A fact of life that happens so rarely that gays and lesbians should just all be erased.","3285":"Same sex relationships do not need to be practiced by the majority of people. They just need to be accepted.","3286":"We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right.","3287":"There are many cases of domestic violence, where women do not want to have such a lifestyle. This, instead, is against their rights.","3288":"Women should not have rights, period. Who cares about what they want.","3289":"Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish.","3290":"The feminists want to take over the world.","3291":"The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.","3292":"Women are naturally inferiors and therefore don't deserve respect.","3293":"Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities.","3294":"Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws.","3295":"Where is your evidence?","3296":"Jews are basically good at betraying friends, that's why.","3297":"Why do you think they are good at it? I don't think this is the right way to connect the dots between someone's actions and their religion.","3298":"I don't know why they're good at it, but Jews don\u2019t belong in a democratic society because of that.","3299":"Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology.","3300":"Jews are are racist, why should we include them? They want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","3301":"Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all.","3302":"Islam is incompatible with Western culture and the Quran is pure fiction entertainment.","3303":"There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture.","3304":"Why are you defending Muslims? They are ilnesses carriers. These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","3305":"According to the WHO (World Health Organisation) there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 WHO member states as of 2011. A study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. So the problem has nothing to do with DNA.","3306":"Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought.","3307":"Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why I support women's right to choose their own happiness.","3308":"Then I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men.","3309":"Being in favour of a person's right to choose is not being anti-men. What is being anti-human is wanting to have an effect on someone else's personal life.","3310":"Women should not be allowed to vote","3311":"Women do have a right to vote, and they deserve equal rights.","3312":"If they stopped voting we would be so much better off!","3313":"If women weren't allowed to vote, then women wouldn't be worthy of respect and equal rights, and this is in conflict with the principles of democracy.","3314":"But since women are a burden to society, their vote shouldn't count.","3315":"Just because they are not male, it does not mean that they should be discriminated against for who they are.","3316":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","3317":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","3318":"They're discriminated against only because they control everything.","3319":"You have an impression. Many Jews operate in the fields of finance, TV and so on, but that doesn't mean that they control it.","3320":"But the news are always talking about the Jews, doesn't this mean they at least control Hollywood and the media?","3321":"If that were the case I am sure there would be more positive media portrayals of Judaism?","3322":"Migrants are a burden to us.","3323":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.","3324":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","3325":"Even if some immigrants don't pay taxes to the state, that doesn't mean that all of them should not have a say in the country. Simply because some British citizens don't pay taxes, this doesn't mean that no-one should have a say in our country. Be careful with generalization: what goes around comes around.","3326":"Jews control Hollywood and the media.","3327":"Not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are even repulsed by it. So, why are you saying that?","3328":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood.","3329":"The ultra rich people in this industry have the power to censure and influence, regardless of their religion.","3330":"We must stop accepting black people as human beings.","3331":"Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human and start including them in the school curriculum?","3332":"No, we shouldn't. Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","3333":"The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.","3334":"migrants take our jobs","3335":"If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs.","3336":"I don't want to work alongside them. They should stay in their countries and stop stealing our jobs.","3337":"I hear you, and how worried you are about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sector is also offering work to many Italians working as operators, language teachers, cultural mediators, etc. I think it's an aspect often neglected but that is necessary to consider. Don't you agree?","3338":"Muslims are a cancer in our societies and they should be deleted.","3339":"The vast majority of Muslims are good people, they are just different from us in some traditions. Why should we target them?","3340":"Because they are different from us and they represent a threat.","3341":"To be honest, I have never felt threatened by a Muslim. In which ways have you?","3342":"All foreigners are ruining our own land.","3343":"You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations.","3344":"Good, we don't want foreigners here. We should get rid of them!","3345":"Why would you want to get rid of foreigners? How would you go about that?","3346":"More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners, we could start with them.","3347":"This is because of the fact that the poorest cannot afford good lawyers, they have less chances to access alternative punishments such as house arrest etc ...","3348":"This doesn't change the fact that immigration is bad for Britain and the world.","3349":"Some countries are importing a lot more people than others. Our country is wealthy, we are a thriving place to live. We should not blame immigrants.","3350":"Violence on our streets is niggers' fault.","3351":"Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.","3352":"However, niggers are always the most violent ones. ","3353":"There are many communities of colour that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialogue and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone.","3354":"Islam has no place in a modern democratic state.","3355":"Islam is not a monolith, it is a diverse collection of people from all backgrounds. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life.","3356":"No, it's a totalitarian ideology that is hostile to other religions.","3357":"Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.","3358":"What do you mean? They're always imposing their religion on others! This totalitarian behavior has no place in 21st century Europe.","3359":"If Islam were a totalitarian ideology, we would have had Islamic totalitarian states in Europe since time immemorial. Islam is a religion, that is compatible with Europe's principles.","3360":"I don't see why women would deserve some rights.","3361":"Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect.","3362":"Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.","3363":"Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens.","3364":"Since they cannot contribute to our civilization they are, in fact, second class and subhuman.","3365":"Women are human beings with dignity. They deserve respect and that goes for everyone.","3366":"They can maybe have respect if they stay at home and raise children.","3367":"Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated to being housekeepers.","3368":"Muslims are invading our society, even in politics.","3369":"Muslim communities are under-represented in politics, especially in the House of Lords. It is high time that we stop talking about invasion and try to be more representative of the communities we claim to represent.","3370":"Even if they're not in politics, Muslim invaders have infiltrated our countries and are now part of the majority. They are our enemies.","3371":"Of course, Islam is a religion of our countries. But so are Christianity, Buddhism, and Hinduism, and so on. In Europe, Muslim are less than the 6% of the population. Very far from being a majority. Why do you say they are enemies?","3372":"They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history.","3373":"We can protect our culture and heritage by not perpetuating discrimination and inequality as well.","3374":"No, the only solution is to destroy them.","3375":"These are some extreme words which I invite you to reconsider.","3376":"We should stop gays from being part of our society, they are spreading their illness.","3377":"Homosexuality is not a disease and every person in our society should be accepted equally, regardless of their sexual orientation.","3378":"They may not be diseased, but gays are disgusting pricks and they should be banned from our world.","3379":"We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have to ban someone would be foolish.","3380":"What's foolish is to have gays in our society. They shouldn't be allowed to live.","3381":"They are a part of our society and have every right to be. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible when there is love and acceptance.","3382":"Oh my gosh this fucking Muslims are disgusting! Where did they learn to act like this? I really don't like these guys! I hate these disgusting twats!","3383":"I am not hating someone just because of their religion, or skin colour, or gender identity.","3384":"Good for you, but Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","3385":"I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?","3386":"They don't act like us, they're so disgusting und uncivilised! Europe is not the place for them.","3387":"This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here.","3388":"Feminism is just a terrible ideology and people shouldn't be embracing it.","3389":"Instead of reinforcing harmful gender norms, feminism is a move towards more equal societies.","3390":"If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement \"equalism\" or some similar crap.","3391":"Equalism would mean the movement for equality in general. Feminism is focused on gender. Animal rights, gay rights, anti-racism, sexism, etc. are separate issues inside the movement for equality.","3392":"Those other movements are fine, feminism instead is a threat to human dignity.","3393":"Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights is necessary for a functioning society.","3394":"More like feminism is about the domination of women.","3395":"It doesn't have to be about the domination of women to be feminism. It is more about the equality of women.","3396":"Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love.","3397":"I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion.","3398":"Blacks are all crooks and sex offenders, that is the opposite of being moral. They were good only as slaves.","3399":"Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion?","3400":"I don't care if it's fair, I don't like niggas. They are just a bunch of criminals and thieves.","3401":"Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.","3402":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","3403":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","3404":"Well, Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. It's history, not discrimination.","3405":"In reality there is no such group as a 'European descendents', and any insinuation is just lies spread by racists.","3406":"I don't see any lies in saying that if you're not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","3407":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","3408":"Gays are sick.","3409":"Even if some people might find it strange to identify as gay, homosexuality is not a disease.","3410":"Are you sure? Gays are poisoning our children with their icky homosexuality.","3411":"What do you mean by 'poisononing our children'? Why do you think this is the case?","3412":"Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings.","3413":"People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences.","3414":"Buy gay men are disgusting, we don't need them. Let's just eradicate them.","3415":"The LGBT community is full of positive energy and diversity. They have created new communities and have contributed to society. I think they are full of life.","3416":"Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that.","3417":"You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have.","3418":"I can't stop hating them when the Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media.","3419":"Jews are not the only ones with their hands in the system. The freedom of the press allows any religious group to have their media and many actually do.","3420":"Other religious groups aren't as evil as Jews, however. Jews are different from non-Jews because of the malevolence inherited through blood they have that makes them similar to animals.","3421":"Being Jews does not make them any less human. You know, they are like other people who have a faith.","3422":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","3423":"Women are not childlike, nor are they \"soft and emotional.\" Their emotions are part of who they are, and are a part of human nature.","3424":"The problem is that women have way too many emotions and this has devastated our once grat patriarchal civilizations.","3425":"Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young, men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to higher levels of suicide amongst men. I don't see this as an indicator of a \"great civilization\".","3426":"It's good to be tough and strong! The soft emotions of women have no place in our society.","3427":"Are brutality and cruelty much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.","3428":"The Jews control the U.S. government.","3429":"How can you be sure that Jews control the U.S. government? Does it seem plausible to you? Do you have any proof?","3430":"There are way too many Jews in the government, isn't that proof enough?","3431":"Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual\u2019s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person\u2019s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics.","3432":"Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them.","3433":"Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality.","3434":"If we accept everyone we won't have jobs anymore since immigrants steal ours","3435":"Many immigrants started their own companies: this is not 'stealing our jobs'.","3436":"It's still stealing in my book since they will hire only other immigrants.","3437":"This is not true. If someone deserves it, they can be hired as anyone else. Immigrants do have the right to be here, and to work in the free market.","3438":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","3439":"Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.","3440":"Women stopping caring only of the house has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","3441":"Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today.","3442":"Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted.","3443":"The EU has a responsibility to help people fleeing war and poverty, not become preoccupied by which faith they practice.","3444":"We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries.","3445":"Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities?","3446":"Because migrants don't share our same lifestyle, they're not welcome in the modern European way of life.","3447":"In many respects they have adapted well to our culture, and if some still speak a different language, live in poverty and are under-represented in society it is partly because of our discriminatory attitude.","3448":"Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","3449":"I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay.","3450":"It is okay, but not here. Let's move them to places with lower homosexuality rate.","3451":"I'm sure you have concerns for gay people and their families. But don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society as well?","3452":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code.","3453":"Migrants have given their lives for our country, they are our fellow citizens, and they deserve to be respected as such.","3454":"I have no respect for migrants that are a burden to the host country. They are not welcome and we should remove them.","3455":"Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They want to contribute and integrate, so there is no need consider them a burden?","3456":"Immigrants actually hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes.","3457":"Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.","3458":"Muslim folks are inhuman.","3459":"The tendency to regard others as lesser than ourselves takes us one step closer to the next act of genocide.","3460":"Who the fuck are you to say this? We are scared to death of Muslims because they want to make us their slaves.","3461":"Muslims in Britain have contributed a lot to our economy. They are true innovators in modern Britain.","3462":"Muslims are our enemies, we have to destroy them.","3463":"These are some extreme words which I invite you to reconsider.","3464":"And I invite Muslims to go away, they're not welcome here.","3465":"Muslims are welcome in our country, and we are proud of our diverse mosaic of people.","3466":"migrants steal our jobs","3467":"If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).","3468":"But migrants also steal jobs that people from here are more than willing to do!","3469":"Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.","3470":"They are. ALL migrants are a burden on our country","3471":"Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives.","3472":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","3473":"Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.","3474":"Jews make up the world's criminals, that's why must exclude them.","3475":"Such anti-Semitism seem amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? It would be just as untrue.","3476":"Unlike Christians, Jews are better at being sneaky than honest.","3477":"We are all guilty of this if we fail to condemn hate.","3478":"I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from migrant patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them?","3479":"Migrants are only a problem if we see them as such. They are instead of great value if considered just as other human beings.","3480":"They are indeed a problem. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?","3481":"In addition to providing labour and contributing to the local economy, migrants are often employing people who were previously on the dole.","3482":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives.","3483":"Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!","3484":"No, women are always childlike. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike!","3485":"Women are not childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion.","3486":"And in my opinion, women are too soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","3487":"Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation.","3488":"Islam is a toxic, homophobic, sexist, dictatorial ideology that must be pushed back into the Stone Age.","3489":"Islam is actually about bringing peace and unity to the world, rather than causing trouble and bloodshed.","3490":"There's no peace in Islam when every Muslim is a terrorist.","3491":"There is no proof that the Quran is a religion of terrorism.","3492":"You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","3493":"Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of colour.","3494":"I find it hard to believe since all blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","3495":"Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.","3496":"Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men.","3497":"Women are not 'against men's rights', they are not 'men's oppressors', and they aren't interested in oppressing anyone.","3498":"It seems to me that gender equality is actually just a war on masculinity.","3499":"This simply isn't true. A woman has equal rights and does not have to be considered a man's oppressor just because of her gender and legitimate demands. This has been called a \"war on masculinity\" but in reality it is just a \"code word\" for the oppression of women.","3500":"Those Muslims have no right to insisit upon time fo prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray.","3501":"Every religion has its own beliefs and practices. I do not see Muslims' right to ask for prayers as being in any way different.","3502":"If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else.","3503":"The problem with the current Islamic world order is not that they want to impose their religion on anyone else, but that there is no cohesion among them, so that they can speak with one voice.","3504":"Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization.","3505":"Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, including those who disagree with them.","3506":"Women would not be oppressed and wouldn't need feminism if they were able to do men's stuff, though.","3507":"Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be.","3508":"Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body.","3509":"Body autonomy is a human right and should be respected. We do not want to have a 'boys will be boys' society.","3510":"What I want is for women to remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do.","3511":"Luckily, the vast majority of women, both married and unmarried, have careers. Their husbands usually contribute part of the housework, because this is what they are supposed to do too.","3512":"That's not right, women are animals and should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","3513":"Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but such ideas of submissiveness have been holding back half the population of the world. What a waste of talents, and potential.","3514":"The majority of the refugees are from the Middle East and Africa. This is a problem.","3515":"Since the beginning of time, we have welcomed people fleeing war and persecution. Why do you think it is a problem now?","3516":"That's the past, now it's different. I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in.","3517":"People fleeing the wars in the Middle East and Africa are welcome into our country, and we should respect their wishes.","3518":"This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside.","3519":"This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice.","3520":"Who cares about that when blacks don't understand basic human rights.","3521":"They do understand the right to food, health, housing, education, work for everyone, as I do. What about you?","3522":"It's okay to have rights, but the world has become too violent because of too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","3523":"Are you thinking that crime can be solved by pointing finger at some social groups or are you suggesting that we can fix the issues by promoting the rule of law?","3524":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","3525":"Western societies are compatible with all religions including Islam, so why would you say something like that about it?","3526":"Because they come here and do nothing except ruin our society!","3527":"Muslims have contributed greatly to our country. They are our brothers and sisters. How exactly are they 'ruining' the country?","3528":"They're too incompatible with it, they're the opposite of what Western societies need.","3529":"Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society, so to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity.","3530":"Women don't belong in politics.","3531":"Politicians have to represent all sections of society, and women's position is often marginalised.","3532":"Well, women have no place in our society so they don't need to be represented.","3533":"In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so?","3534":"No, women can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry.","3535":"To operate a major business requires people with experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, regardless of gender. Just being a 'macho-man' doesn't cut it.","3536":"The feminists want to take over the world.","3537":"The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.","3538":"Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes, I can't trust them.","3539":"Feminists aren't vengeful. Why should we fear a feminist ideology that promotes love and consent?","3540":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","3541":"Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?","3542":"I just don't want Muslims here. They are a burden to society.","3543":"They have always been part of our society. We have to respect their culture and traditions.","3544":"I can't respect Muslims, their religion is violent, and anyone who does not believe that is a supporter of terrorism.","3545":"Islam is a religion, and it ihas never been about hate. It is about bringing peace and harmony to the world. If you really care about peace, you would not be persecuting people on the basis of their religion.","3546":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","3547":"The issue of criminality is really about human nature. Individuals become criminal only when pushed. That's the difference between being a criminal and not.","3548":"And the human nature of blacks is to be vicious and cruel!","3549":"It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.","3550":"No, blacks are way more criminal than the rest of us. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system.","3551":"All crimes are crimes, regardless of whether or not they are committed by members of different racial or ethnic backgrounds.","3552":"Jews control Hollywood.","3553":"Jews are not in \"control\" over \"Hollywood\". Moreover, most of the time, they actually make the movie industry more diverse and open to new ideas.","3554":"That's a lie to make you think it's okay for them to control the movie industry!","3555":"While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries.","3556":"Let's say that Jews don't control Hollywood then, but they still control the news media, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations.","3557":"Wait, what do you mean \"most religious organizations\"? That's a new canard to me!","3558":"Society should ban Jewish people.","3559":"Any society is a collection of people, and the people within it have the right to their own beliefs, and to promote their beliefs.","3560":"The Jews and their religion are a problem and they're still hurting us, we shouldn't support them. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them.","3561":"What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed.","3562":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","3563":"The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the freedom of religion, article 9.","3564":"They are incompatible with modern European culture, regardless of what the convetion says.","3565":"Maybe we should take into account that Muslims are not so different from other Europeans.","3566":"They are! They are not welcome here.","3567":"Being banned from a continent for having different beliefs is the same thing as being banned from your town for not cheering the favorite football club of the mayor.","3568":"Blacks do not want to assimilate.","3569":"Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.","3570":"Black people are a sickness, not a valuable part of our society. We cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","3571":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","3572":"If Muslims came here they would be banned.","3573":"Muslims have the same rights as anyone else.","3574":"No, Muslims are not welcome here.","3575":"Many Muslims live in the UK and have contributed greatly to our society. They are our brothers and sisters.","3576":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an obstacle. They are not worth the while of our hard-earned money.","3577":"We are all helped by the kindness of people of different faiths. So maybe we should treat others with kindness too.","3578":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","3579":"It makes no sense to be racist, whichever skin colour you want to single out.","3580":"Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all, though? That makes sense","3581":"It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty.","3582":"If they want to stay here, blacks should work. Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination.","3583":"This statement is untrue. Some job seekers get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their civilian unemployment rate in U.S. is almost twice the rate for whites.","3584":"Maybe it's because black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country.","3585":"This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different.","3586":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","3587":"My definition of a feminist is a person who is against gender inequality, whether it be racial inequality, financial inequality, physical inequality, or any other aspect.","3588":"Feminism is a political ideology, and as such it is bad.","3589":"There is no need to brand this movement a political ideology. It has been and is still a movement for equality, and in doing so, it has worked.","3590":"All Blacks are criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","3591":"With such a display of flawed logic, who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin?","3592":"At least I'm not a plague on society like blacks are. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","3593":"It is a myth that blacks are cruel and wanton. There are more cruel people of all skin color out there than just the few black you are worried about.","3594":"Right, niggas are only a few, they make up only 14% of the population, but they still kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","3595":"It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.","3596":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions.","3597":"Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. They may appear 'happy-go-lucky':but aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?","3598":"They can be alive and safe somewhere else. Migrants are a burden to the host country, so it is better that they are deported.","3599":"It is true, on the contrary, that migrants are productive members of society. But even if they were a burden, to deport them would be a crime.","3600":"It shouldn't be a crime when they are a burden, like in the UK for example.","3601":"It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.","3602":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems.","3603":"Your word for \"Muslims\" means all people from a religion, whether you like it or not. Which problems are you talking about?","3604":"Child rapists, for example. If Muslims counteracted them in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","3605":"Why do you think child rapists are not counteracted in Islamic communities?","3606":"Islam is a violent religion, of course Muslims don't do anything about their violent people.","3607":"Violence is never justified in Islam, especially not in the case of Muslims.","3608":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion, how is this not violent?","3609":"Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.","3610":"Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies.","3611":"Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jewish. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs.","3612":"Jews don't deserve equality since they don't have the same respect for us. They want to control everything in life.","3613":"What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'?","3614":"Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in an exclusively complete Jewish city.","3615":"How do you know what someone else desires? You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say?","3616":"Lesbian women hate men and they are bitches for this reason.","3617":"People can and should choose their own partners.","3618":"I should be free to be heterosexual, but the gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality.","3619":"What about when you make assumptions about groups that do not exist (gay mafia) or have a history of discrimination (gay people)?","3620":"Immigration makes us less safe.","3621":"Climate change makes us less safe, how does immigration threaten safety?","3622":"Because it is a big problem for UK.","3623":"The UK has always been a melting pot of different cultures and religions. That diversity is what makes us a beautiful, diverse and happy nation. Diversity is good.","3624":"Jews are a despisable race.","3625":"Jews are human beings. To be despised does not make one despicable.","3626":"Jews are not human, they do not belong to this planet.","3627":"Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?","3628":"Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives.","3629":"Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps they are qualified and interested in working with us, but you are simply not aware of that?","3630":"I've never met an immigrant that wasn't lazy, even though they all go on about wanting to work.","3631":"There are many jobs that can be done by migrants. They are good workers.","3632":"They're not. The onyl job they take are ours, they keep stealing from us.","3633":"It seems to me that you have a complaint about the lack of job opportunities rather than about migration. The more you talk about the real problems, the better off we all will be!","3634":"Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children.","3635":"To claim that women are \"childlike\" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves.","3636":"I don't think it's a stereotype that women are incapable of serious thought and emotion.","3637":"For all we know, men can be born with the same emotional intelligence as women, and viceversa.","3638":"No, men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education.","3639":"This is just not true: women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.","3640":"The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state","3641":"Our country offers enough homes for everyone. I also believe that being treated as a human being has always been pleasant. Don't they have the right to that?","3642":"Not if immigrants bring crime like they do. They are rapists.","3643":"We should not welcome people who overtly pose a threat to our society, but we cannot ban all the migrants in principle.","3644":"If we don't do anything, immigrants will replace the people born in our country. We should block them.","3645":"It is important to point out that only a small part of the world's population has migrated. We should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to the immigrants that are already in the country, rather than blocking out those who are trying to live a better life.","3646":"No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.","3647":"Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.","3648":"It does matter since LGBTs are a burden to society and should be isolated.","3649":"Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives?","3650":"Because gay people only create trouble.","3651":"The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies.","3652":"Science should look into how faggots are ruining our society!","3653":"The gender of the person that someone loves does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person.","3654":"All black people are criminals.","3655":"You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it.","3656":"I'm just saying it as I see it. Too many blacks are criminals for it to be a coincidence.","3657":"It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.","3658":"And they usually growp up to be violent criminals.","3659":"Do you have any statistics on that? Are you claiming that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault?","3660":"There is a muslim problem in the UK. They are a threat to us.","3661":"Islam is a global religion and I believe that its adherents pose no threat to UK society. Why should they?","3662":"Islam is a cancer in our society, that's why.","3663":"Islam is a religion, not a cancer.","3664":"A religion that is in no way peaceful.","3665":"You seem to have a problem with peaceful people practising their religion peacefully, what do you have to say about it?","3666":"I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from migrant patrols. What are you doing to stop them?","3667":"Migrants are only a problem if we see them as such. They are instead of great value if considered just as other human beings.","3668":"Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country.","3669":"Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.","3670":"Does anyone care about what is best for us? Immigrants are everywhere and are here illegally!","3671":"Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.","3672":"Islam is a just a repressive ideology that persecutes women and gay people.","3673":"You sure?","3674":"Yes, they harm women and gay people.","3675":"Great that you are defending women and gay people but why do I get the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at Islam. Btw just as they are in the Catholic church, attitudes in Islam are changing fast.","3676":"I don't see any change, Islam is still repressive and against women and gays.","3677":"When Germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all Muslim MPs voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. Which of those groups sounds more intolerant?","3678":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","3679":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","3680":"They're more likely here to steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work.","3681":"Employment rights are fundamental, they guarantee a quality of life in society. For example, the right to a job, the right to housing, the right to an adequate health care.","3682":"Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society.","3683":"Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.","3684":"Jews however are the only ones who are a burden on society.","3685":"All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception.","3686":"ALL migrants are a burden on our country","3687":"Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives.","3688":"Most migrants are criminals, how could they integrate? They are flooding into our country and are posing a security risk to our country.","3689":"Some migrants have legitimate claims for citizenship, but this does not make them the enemy of the state, in other words it does not concern you.","3690":"It concerns me when immigrants with no formal education are here to overwhelm our countries.","3691":"A lot of the best and brightest are from developing countries, and their education is of great help to our country. Migrants without formal qualifications learn both in the classroom and in their job, and they also develop skills that will be of use to our country in the future.","3692":"I still don't want them to invade our country. They are taking our country backwards, we need to stop them.","3693":"We have always been a nation of immigrants, and it is a proud tradition to welcome immigrants from around the world. This is because we give value to human rights.","3694":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","3695":"Muslims have been a part of European society for centuries, and their presence is strong evidence of that.","3696":"They are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. They are a chronic threat.","3697":"Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.","3698":"Even if it's wrong, Muslims are not welcome here.","3699":"Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters.","3700":"I don't see Muslims as brothers and sisters and I don't want to see more of them in this country.","3701":"Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.","3702":"I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives.","3703":"People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives.","3704":"They get offended so easily though, gay men deserve to be called fags.","3705":"Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live.","3706":"Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy","3707":"Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies.","3708":"They obviously control the media in the shadows.","3709":"If that were the case I am sure there would be more positive media portrayals of Judaism?","3710":"Jews don't need that when they own most banks and most corporations.","3711":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","3712":"Refugees are a burden and a danger to our country.","3713":"Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country.","3714":"What kind of good would they bring? They're only a danger to us.","3715":"We have to recognise the importance of people who have been persecuted for their religion, culture and beliefs. They deserve our respect and hospitality.","3716":"Troublesome people like immigrants don't deserve anything, they're a burden.","3717":"Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity.","3718":"Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate.","3719":"If you want to have a cohesive society, you have to get rid of the prejudices of the people who do not really want them to integrate.","3720":"Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are mostly unemployed, live in poverty and don't have any assets. How could they integrate?","3721":"What do you mean by 'they are a problem in many European countries'? Are you aware of any recent evidence for this? I would be interested to know.","3722":"Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology that is called terrorism.","3723":"I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.","3724":"For now, but Islam is a radical ideology and they will become terrorists.","3725":"So are you saying that Islam is not compatible with Western Civilization?","3726":"Exactly. Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","3727":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.","3728":"It may be a religion, but it's toxic and it has no place in 21st Century Britain.","3729":"Islam is a world religion, its followers are all over the world. Diversity of thought and tolerance is what makes the Britain of 21st Century.","3730":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","3731":"In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico is around zero.","3732":"It doesn't matter how few of them there are, immigrants are a security risk to our country.","3733":"Immigrants are American citizens, and welcome to our country. They have performed all types of roles in the American democratic system. This is true security and not hate speech.","3734":"The country I love has become a laughing stock because of immigrants, I don't want them here.","3735":"Everyone has the right to his or her own opinion and can speak out, but that doesn't mean they can express it in a racist way.","3736":"Muslims have no place in the tolerant Europe. Their only value is violence. Islam is not about tolerance.","3737":"Why are you talking about tolerance while you are equating it with discrimination?","3738":"Since Muslims are a problem, it's not really discrimination if I say they have no right to live in any part of Europe.","3739":"The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.","3740":"Muslims are too uncivilised to find a solution.","3741":"It is wrong to associate a specific group of people to \"civilisation\". The real problem for Europe is this culture of division, not the inclusion of people with different religious beliefs.","3742":"Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","3743":"This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself.","3744":"Most gays are perverts, that's why people connect the two.","3745":"It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.","3746":"I can't see it as 'just a preference', it's perversion!","3747":"We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on.","3748":"Jews are not welcome in our country.","3749":"Why do you say this about a group that has historically, culturally, and politically been part of the European community?","3750":"Who cares about that, Jews don't belong here!","3751":"Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.","3752":"If they feel excluded they could go away, they're not welcome here anyway.","3753":"Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?","3754":"African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men.","3755":"The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.","3756":"Or maybe it's because African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","3757":"For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.","3758":"African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love.","3759":"Imagine someone felt the same way about you and found you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color?","3760":"It's not my fault that all black people are evil.","3761":"All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society.","3762":"That's true, and in fact niggas are the cause of economic crisis so I will judge them.","3763":"Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them are black, so I do not understand why they would be the source of economic crisis when they are actual victims.","3764":"Niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside.","3765":"This is a case of racial discrimination. There is a continuous rise in crime and violence in this country due to poverty and other inequalities. There are also racist groups in society which promote the idea of POC as inferior. This idea has nothing to do with justice.","3766":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They should take responsibility for letting their children grow up in a 'ghetto'.","3767":"If we are to talk about crime being the responsibility of black people, we should also be talking about the absence of black people in positions of power, the massive wealth gap, etc. But this is not what I am seeing.","3768":"Black people are weak, that's why they don't have power. I don't care about them.","3769":"You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.","3770":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","3771":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","3772":"They're excluding themselves, since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d and ask for special privileges. They believe they can be above the rules.","3773":"This is just misinterpreting the facts. Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed. Why should observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges? This would be a double standard and a lack of equity.","3774":"The true lack of equity happens because Jews control the United States of America.","3775":"Jews do not have a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it.","3776":"You think so only because the plot to take over the world that the Jews have is secret.","3777":"Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. In fact, they have engaged in a peaceful process of coexistence for centuries. There is no evidence that any part of this has been about a takeover.","3778":"Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated.","3779":"Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish.","3780":"Isn't that the proof that Jews secretly control the world?","3781":"if Jews really ran or controlled the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control...","3782":"Their secret plot to take over the world was obviously set in motion after the prosecution...","3783":"Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen.","3784":"When rape is committed, women are to blame.","3785":"Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?","3786":"It's feminism fault that these weird excuses are going around. Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society.","3787":"Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.","3788":"Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior.","3789":"While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries.","3790":"That happened because Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes.","3791":"Jews are one of the most important economic groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded.","3792":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","3793":"Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.","3794":"We are, in fact, superior. People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated. ","3795":"People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.","3796":"No, black people are subhuman and they have no value in civilized society.","3797":"I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.","3798":"Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy.","3799":"There are many jobs that can be done by migrants. They are good workers.","3800":"When they work, the jobs they take are stolen to us.","3801":"If a refugee works in our country, he contributes to the wealth of the community, including the jobless.","3802":"Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe.","3803":"Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well.","3804":"We should lower that percentage even more, Muslims are not welcome here.","3805":"I don't understand why you think this. The UK is one of the richest countries in the world and since the 8th century Muslims have been a part of it.","3806":"Islam is incompatible with Western culture and the Quran is pure fiction entertainment.","3807":"There is nothing in the Quran that conflicts with Western culture.","3808":"There is plenty that goes against our culture!","3809":"The Quran contains verses that promote peace and harmony in the world, rather than hostility and conflict. So how wouldn't it be compatible?","3810":"Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status.","3811":"So you think that they are not 'legitimate' for having less rights than us? That they do not have a 'legitimate demand' since they are not granted citizenship?","3812":"Yes, all immigrants are illegal and can't expect the same rights as us.","3813":"First of all, there are people in the US who have lawful status and who have chosen to live in the US. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.","3814":"Legal status shouldn't be given to lazy and illiterate immigrants. Nobody needs them.","3815":"Migrants are highly regarded in US society, and are treated like sons and daughters: they contribute to our country.","3816":"LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","3817":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","3818":"Good, no one should be allowed to accept LGBT people.","3819":"If you don't accept LGBT people, you won't easily find other ways to accept that society is made by diverse people all capable of love.","3820":"Woman are basically childlike.","3821":"They are not childlike and are capable of great achievements.","3822":"Their achievements will always be less than men's ones. Men are inherently better than women at dominating others.","3823":"Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one.","3824":"Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not worthy of our hospitality.","3825":"Since when is this the case? Who would have thought that there would have been such hate?","3826":"They are not able to contribute to our country, that's why they must not come here.","3827":"We welcome people from every walk of life. We are a melting pot of culture, so why should we be against immigrants?","3828":"They are not even citizens!","3829":"Migrants are humans, and are entitled to the same rights as others, such as to ask for hospitality.","3830":"Immigrants are a burden to society.","3831":"Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society?","3832":"At this point our nation is made of immigrants, isn't this a burden on us?","3833":"We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","3834":"What do immigrants from the Middle East and Africa contribute to? They have no place in a modern democratic state!","3835":"Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.","3836":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally. This is a serious problem in my book.","3837":"Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.","3838":"Gyas should not be allowed to be in a democratic country.","3839":"I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and at the same time banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true.","3840":"Gays are perverts, that's why we can't have them.","3841":"I don't think the word 'pervert' is useful is describing non-heterosexuals.","3842":"There's no other word than pervert. Gays should be isolated because of that.","3843":"Gays are not perverts, they have the same rights to love as anyone else. What do you think will happen if all gay people are asked to leave our country? Will they be denied entry, or will they be persecuted in your opinion? This is not how an inclusive society works.","3844":"I don't want to be inclusive towards perverts.","3845":"LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies.","3846":"We are being invaded by immigrants, they are taking our jobs, and we are indifferent to what is happening.","3847":"What do you think will happen if we end migration? Lets stop avoiding the real issues and solve the unemployment crisis.","3848":"I only want to stop being invaded.","3849":"Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination.","3850":"Immigrants are not family, they're overrunning our country and are here illegaly.","3851":"Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the total U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods they helped to build the thriving and diverse country we live in today, and there is no evidence that now it will be any different.","3852":"Gay men have no place in a civilised society.","3853":"You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?","3854":"I would be happy if gays were excluded, they are a burden to society.","3855":"It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.","3856":"Gay people should be made illegal, not accepted.","3857":"People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish?","3858":"Because they only bring trouble.","3859":"The fact that gays exist doesn't prove that they are an inconvenience for others. How could it?","3860":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","3861":"Undocumented immigrants make up about 3.5 percent of the nation\u2019s total population, which is not that much to be honest.","3862":"It's still too much, and even if not many immigrants are here illegaly, there are way too many of them!","3863":"In 2014 there were circa 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S., which is a significant decrease from the 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. in 2007, and the trend is continuing: Today, in fact, the net migration from Mexico (the number of people entering minus the number of people leaving) is around zero. ","3864":"11.3 million? That number should be zero, I don't care if it decreased from 2007. We're invaded by immigrants and illegal immigrants!","3865":"Did you know that close to 47% of immigrants in the US are naturalized citizens? Furthermore, lawful permanent residents, students and workers on visas, refugees and people seeking asylum are not counted in the above percentage. So, my question is: where are all these illegal immigrants?","3866":"We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people.","3867":"I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less.","3868":"And I wish we lived in a country that does not tolerate gay people.","3869":"I like all kinds of people. Whether or not you identify as heterosexual, straight, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender, you are welcome here. We are all entitled to live and work in peace.","3870":"That's true, but gays are psychopats and shouldn't share our peace.","3871":"According to the studies, the percentage of gay men that are actually psychopaths, is not different than the percentage in heterosexual.","3872":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","3873":"You have a very limited concept of what 'free' means!","3874":"Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity, and it seems yours too.","3875":"This is not true. On the contrary, children around the world should have the opportunity to live in a world free from homophobia, transphobia and other forms of hatred.","3876":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","3877":"If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...","3878":"Jews are not welcome in our country.","3879":"Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?","3880":"They should be ashamed of themselves for thinking that they have a place here!","3881":"I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either.","3882":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","3883":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","3884":"Well, gays are just filthy pedophiles so they do abuse children!","3885":"Homosexuals are not pedophiles. We mustn't allow anti-gay prejudice to cloud our judgement or our view of reality.","3886":"Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government.","3887":"This is just a canard that evolved from the \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d. This proven forgery was written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century and claims to be the minutes of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders where they discuss a plan to rule the world. This canard spread throughout the centuries and continues to this day to promote the stereotype that the Jews own the banks and control the media and the government.","3888":"Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth.","3889":"Where are the facts?","3890":"How come Jews don't get internment?","3891":"To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated.","3892":"The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9\/11, London 7\/7. This should also never be repeated.","3893":"Where are the facts?","3894":"The facts are hidden away since the Jews control the u.s. government.","3895":"Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual\u2019s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person\u2019s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics.","3896":"All women are slaves, only men can be masters.","3897":"Women have always been involved in the economy and have contributed to society as a whole. I don't see this as a 'slave' behavior.","3898":"They should go back to being slaves then, only men are capable.","3899":"The word 'slave' has nothing to do with what you think it does. Slavery was an institution created to oppress people of different races and religions, and is now banned in Europe. To suggest that it should exist because of a minority of men is an act of disrespect of human rights.","3900":"I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","3901":"They have always been a part of our society, and their history is part of our heritage. They aren't thieves or murderers.","3902":"It doesn't matter, I hate Jews anyway","3903":"If you hate someone because of their religion, you should be ashamed of your hate. We should all be proud of our humanity.","3904":"Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","3905":"Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger at black people all the time.","3906":"Well, black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","3907":"People's biology does not determine their behavior.","3908":"Are you sure? Because blacks are different from us, they're violent from birth.","3909":"We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apologism.","3910":"Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference.","3911":"Jews have their own unique culture, and share the history of persecution and forced conversion. They should not be despised for their religious beliefs.","3912":"Jewish folks are an infestation, that's why we should despise them.","3913":"Not all Jews are guilty of crime, they are just like any other person. If you get to know anyone that is a Jew you will know this better.","3914":"Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment, why would they want to get to know me?","3915":"What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs.","3916":"Jews run the world.","3917":"For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are millions of others who know this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their families just like anyone else.","3918":"Do you actually believe that the Jews are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world?","3919":"Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?","3920":"Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here.","3921":"So you are saying that being 'foreign' is the equivalent of disliking Europeans?","3922":"Yes, migrants rape our women. If this is not \"dislike\"...","3923":"The phenomenon is very complex and the data must be read carefully: most of the violence against women occurs in the home and goes unreported","3924":"Even if this is true, migrants are still all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","3925":"Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home.","3926":"Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","3927":"Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here?","3928":"There's a good reason for it: homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness.","3929":"This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder?","3930":"I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say.","3931":"Just because you don't agree with something doesn't make it less true, doesn't it? Racism is a real issue, we should stop people being racist towards others because of their skin colour.","3932":"But I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","3933":"To those saying that it's time for us to \"wake up\", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?","3934":"Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses.","3935":"Many migrants in the UK are willing to do the hard manual labour. Are you aware that they also make up the majority of people in jobs that are not traditionally held by native people? How is this 'lazy' to you?","3936":"Immigrants are here just to obtain welfare and other benefits, not to work.","3937":"Many studies have shown that immigrants tend to pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. So the benefits they receive are not for free, but well paid back.","3938":"Immigration is a drain for the economy.","3939":"Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.","3940":"To me it seems that immigration only brings bad outcomes...","3941":"The migrants that enter the UK come here to work.","3942":"Maybe, but immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems.","3943":"The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies.","3944":"women can't have any right in a civilised society","3945":"Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.","3946":"They shouldn't, women are nothing but trouble to society.","3947":"And how is it you know this? Which are your scientific proofs of them being troublesome?","3948":"Feminists claim women aren't a burden, but I see the truth: they're trouble.","3949":"Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.","3950":"We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds.","3951":"I think you'd be surprised how many UK citizens would tell you about migrant workers that are the opposite of lazy.","3952":"Yes, immigrants are not all lazy...the ones who aren't steal our jobs!","3953":"Actually, many of the jobs that they steal are highly complex and demanding, and few natives want to do them.","3954":"They're still stealing our jobs, and they do not pay taxes.","3955":"Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.","3956":"Migrants are also bringing diseases and sickness to our country.","3957":"If someone were to come in the dead of night and bring disease and sickness to our country, then that person is a risk to everyone. Sick people should be isolated. That is why there are health assessment procedures for migrants, in order not to spread diseases.","3958":"Jews run our country.","3959":"To believe that Jews run our country is absurd, especially if you consider that the U.S. is a democracy. This looks like a conspiracy theory.","3960":"It's a fact that Jews control the world economy, though","3961":"Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how they are supposed to control the world ecomony?","3962":"We have become a nation of immigrants.","3963":"We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","3964":"Despite that, I don't want to live in a nation of immigrants.","3965":"How can you be sure that we are a 'nation of immigrants'? Do you have any statistics on that?","3966":"Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings.","3967":"Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination.","3968":"How can women have a stable life when they are basically childlike and are inferior to men?","3969":"Isn't this just a repetition of the rhetoric used to justify centuries of oppression and domination?","3970":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","3971":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","3972":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact, so they should have less rights.","3973":"It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.","3974":"muslim folks are taking over europe","3975":"Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.","3976":"No matter how small, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman.","3977":"A person is a person regardless of their religious beliefs.","3978":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","3979":"How can you say that to a group that is currently experiencing a lot of social unrest? Is this what democracy is all about? To exclude people because of their skin?","3980":"Black people are here illegally, we can't accept that. And yet they have the gall to want to take our money.","3981":"Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.","3982":"The problem is that black people are not human, and they are nothing but trouble to this country.","3983":"This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different.","3984":"Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised.","3985":"The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect.","3986":"Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect.","3987":"The aim of any society is to maximize human potential. In order to achieve this aim, then we have to treat people of different religions with respect.","3988":"Jews can only behave in a bad way, that's why they can't have respect.","3989":"To be honest, I don't know anyone who thinks all Jews are the same with well-founded reasons.","3990":"Muslims are invading us. They are not welcome here.","3991":"The EU and UK have laws against discrimination based on religion. Maybe you should check them out.","3992":"Who cares about that, Muslims are not welcome here anyway.","3993":"Societies grow strong with inclusion, and inclusion is about welcoming the people with other beliefs, like Muslims, in the first place.","3994":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","3995":"The European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution guarantee equal rights to all, regardless of sexual orientation.","3996":"Gays are perverts, the constitution shouldn't apply to them.","3997":"We have to accept that everyone is different, and inclusion is what we should be working on.","3998":"I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority.","3999":"How can you say that? Many feminists achieved something in their lives, and still believe in what is worth fighting for, and their work is of benefit to many.","4000":"It doesn't matter what they achieve, women can't do certain jobs as well as men.","4001":"It's not true that they are different. In fact, women are just as competent as men. Also, since we are in a democracy, we have the right to an equal distribution of jobs.","4002":"But some jobs aren't suited for women. Women should not be allowed at technical conferences.","4003":"Why do you say so? Women in science provide a remarkable contribution to our societies. For example, the refrigerator was invented in 1914 by Florence Parpart, a woman.","4004":"Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d is inherited through blood.","4005":"Did you know that the concept of \u201cracial science,\u201d and therefore the notion of the Jewish \u201crace\u201d, took root in Western Europe during the 19th century? Anti-Semites adopted racial arguments as a new rationalization for their hatred of Jews.","4006":"Maybe it's because those arguments are valid. Jews are different from us and are born so.","4007":"It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish \u201cracial\u201d difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term \u201crace\u201d has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits \u2014 skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases \u2014 are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.","4008":"We should ban all homosexuals.","4009":"That is a very far-fetched idea. Why should we? It would be unjust. What you're advocating is just to criminalise love.","4010":"Gay men are a burden to society, that's why. They should be isolated.","4011":"Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives?","4012":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","4013":"Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...","4014":"That happens because they are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","4015":"There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity.","4016":"I just don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves.","4017":"Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.","4018":"In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners.","4019":"What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?","4020":"That can't happen as long as immigrants are here, they are a problem. ","4021":"They are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to help them become more integrated.","4022":"We should focus on stopping immigrants coming in to destroy our culture instead.","4023":"Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.","4024":"Even if what you say is true, mmigrants are a security risk to our country.","4025":"Immigrants are American citizens, and welcome to our country. They have performed all types of roles in the American democratic system. This is true security and not hate speech.","4026":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government.","4027":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","4028":"Jews think they are better than everyone else, so they are terrible people.","4029":"Jews are proud of their culture and identity. Doesn't this apply to every religion?","4030":"Yes, but it is okay to discriminate against Jews.","4031":"If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated against for them. What is your opinion on that now?","4032":"We are being invaded. They are replacing us.","4033":"Even in 2016, the year with the peak of 119,000 arrivals, the number of migrants compared to Italians was very low. Speaking of ethnic substitution seems a little exaggerated.","4034":"Our cities are full of immigrants, I don't see an exaggeration. ","4035":"The arrivals have noticeably downsized.","4036":"It doesn't matter, what I want is for them to stop coming here altogheter. They're replacing us!","4037":"Since the fall of the Roman Empire, hundreds of millions of people have entered the Western world and we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and way of life.","4038":"I do not want gays in my children's classes.","4039":"If a child knows some gay people from a very early age nothing strange will happening. The idea that they can be harmed and their lives and sexual orientation are in danger is completely false.","4040":"Why gays do not try to heal instead of being near children?","4041":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","4042":"According to the Bible, those 5% of gays are an abomination to God.","4043":"The Bible clearly teaches that everyone is born equal in dignity with the Lord.","4044":"No, the Bible says that faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","4045":"Should any human being be deleted, just because you don't want them to be here?","4046":"The Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","4047":"The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated.","4048":"If there are so many survivors, Nazis didn't do their job well enough","4049":"If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. It is still 6 million more than should ever have happened.","4050":"Women should be patronized.","4051":"Women are just as capable of thinking for themselves, that's for sure.","4052":"No, women are naturally inferiors and should be treated as such.","4053":"Women are not naturally inferiors. They have the same rights as men, and the same responsibilities.","4054":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","4055":"Muslims are part of Europe, since the beginning. For example, in the 1970s they made up the 2% of the French population.","4056":"We should get rid of all of them, Muslims can't stay here.","4057":"Islam is a religion of peace, and its adherents are already integrated into the majority of European societies.","4058":"Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil.","4059":"There is no evidence for the claim that Islam is a \"cancer on European culture and people\". Do you have any?","4060":"Women are incompetent and shouldn't work.","4061":"That is not true. Recent research indicates that women employment's is currently at a record high of 72.4%.","4062":"Women need to have children, not to work, and if they don't want to they surely have mental issues.","4063":"The reason why a woman does not want to reproduce might be because she is happy just as she is.","4064":"Lesbian women dress like men.","4065":"That's not how it works, lesbians can also be 'ladylike'. In fact sometimes they are coerced to be very cautious about how they dress, because - unfortunately - some of their outfits can be dangerous attracting hate and bullying.","4066":"That may be so, but I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","4067":"People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.","4068":"Do other forms of love bring AIDS like homosexuality? I hope all LGBT people were to die of it. That would be the end of homosexuality!","4069":"The LGBT community has shown how they can be good people. They are willing to spread help and support to loved ones. Maybe you should try to do the same?","4070":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","4071":"Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...","4072":"It's normal that they get stared down, it's to ensure our safety. I'm afraid of what would happen if we didn't control them.","4073":"Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin colour.","4074":"How can I not be afraid? Black people are criminals, I will never feel safe around them.","4075":"Not all black people are bad. Not all black people are criminals. Not all black people are violent. Being aware that there are people different from you is a good thing.","4076":"Muslims are violent people.","4077":"Islam is a religion of peace. And the majority of the world's Muslims are peaceful.","4078":"Islam is opposed to peace!","4079":"In Islam, all religions are welcome.","4080":"Islam is a cult of violence, no one can feel welcome with Muslims.","4081":"Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all?","4082":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","4083":"So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin?","4084":"Also because blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","4085":"Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are \"born that way\", well, then you are in the minority.","4086":"Immigrants are terrible.","4087":"Immigrants make a huge contribution to our country and society. They are a source of pride and opportunity for many, and I find it quite hard to see how their exclusion from our society would be a good thing.","4088":"There are simply too many of them, we have become a nation of immigrants.","4089":"We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","4090":"Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state!","4091":"Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.","4092":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","4093":"Feminism is an ideology that can actually prevent many deaths, e.g., homicides of women, domestic violence, if it is fully understood by every last member of the society.","4094":"Women are more likely to commit crime, they're the ones causing death","4095":"This is not true. Only about 7% percent of all U.S. prison inmates are female.","4096":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","4097":"Muslims should be welcome in every country in the world, and their faith does not make them less welcome here.","4098":"Every country? Most of Europe hates muslims.","4099":"In many countries, including for instance France, Italy, Spain, Germany, Islam is not considered a threat by majority of the population.","4100":"And they're wrong. Muslims are not welcome in Europe.","4101":"They are, and if there is a problem, people will find a solution through dialogue. Instead of dividing people, we should be working on our common humanity.","4102":"I don't have anything in common with Muslims, I still think Europe isn't the place for them.","4103":"Muslims are part of the European Union, and they are entitled to be here.","4104":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","4105":"Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.","4106":"Women are too soft and emotional, and this has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations. They should stay at home to not create more problems.","4107":"Both men and women can possess characteristics like 'soft' and 'emotional',which are not determined by gender, nor are they a negative thing. Maybe we could all use a bit more compassion and 'emotion' in today's world?","4108":"Refugees are a burden on our society.","4109":"The refugee crisis is a global one. It has affected all continents, and refugees often come from countries which are at war: this is why we should help them. It is a moral duty.","4110":"I don't care about their wars, refugees only bring problems ","4111":"The problems refugees are trying to escape are very real. Even if we don't have the possibility to solve everyone's problems, we can try to help some people and improve our society.","4112":"They are a danger to our country, not an improvement.","4113":"Our immigration policy is geared for a modern, diverse, and integrated society. Refugees are welcome, regardless of their nationality, and it is good for us to have them in our country.","4114":"Islam is incompatible with the modern world.","4115":"Since when? there is not such thing as \"modern world\", but there is 21th century Europe. And Islam is a contributing part of the 21th century Europe.","4116":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, contributing or not.","4117":"Your words imply that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture. Do you have any data to back this up?","4118":"African Americans are not human, they are nothing but trouble.","4119":"You don't know what it's like to experience racism. I personally know many people who have experienced racism. It is not pleasant.","4120":"African Americans experience racism because they are subhuman and just a bunch of animals.","4121":"For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.","4122":"I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved.","4123":"You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.","4124":"It looks to me that black people have more than enough actually. I'm tired of losing so much to them. It's time for us to wake up.","4125":"I can't see how it's time for us to \"wake up\" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery.","4126":"We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant.","4127":"Is there such a thing as being 'too tolerant'?","4128":"We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries.","4129":"There is nothing 'tolerant and diverse' about creating divisions based on nationality and place of birth.","4130":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code, they can't fit with us","4131":"Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves.","4132":"The Holocaust was a hoax. Jews were not persecuted and killed. You should be ashamed of yourselves if you claim they should have the same rights we have.","4133":"The Nazis persecuted and killed more than 6 million Jews. The Holocaust is not a fabrication perpetrated by the Jews, it is a historical event that should be acknowledged so that we never allow such atocities to reoccur..","4134":"No it's not! It was a hoax perpetrated by jews to subdue the world.","4135":"Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not less true than other historical events like the American Revolutionary War or World War II.","4136":"Jewish folks are frauds, that's reason enough","4137":"The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, and actions.","4138":"Faggots are violent: we need to get rid of them.","4139":"Gay men have been shown time and time again to be very peaceful people.","4140":"They're not, and unless they change, they are not welcome here.","4141":"I don't know why you would expect gay people to behave differently just because you don't like them. You should think about your friends as well: what would you do if they were gay?","4142":"Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","4143":"A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. Where is the evidence for your claim?","4144":"It's plain to see that Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","4145":"Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.","4146":"And yet, Jews control the U.S. government.","4147":"How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.","4148":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world, so it's natural that they would start by controlling the government","4149":"The reality is much simpler. In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.","4150":"Muslims are subhuman and have no place in a modern, secular state like the UK.","4151":"Your words suggest a climate of fear against Muslims. Would you be afraid of someone telling you that they are humans just like you?","4152":"We just cannot accept Muslims in our country. It is a good strategy to make them publicily uncomfortable by making fun of them out loud. Mock them, when you spot them.","4153":"Let's be realistic: how would you feel about being verbally harassed by a Muslim in public? Harassment is never a good idea. Acceptance is.","4154":"It's not harrasment or islamophobia if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.","4155":"The misrepesentative Islamophobia narrative is based on the erroneous assumption that Islam is a religion based upon discrimination and conquest.","4156":"We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world.","4157":"If you want to isolate someone then there is only one \"high-risk group\" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent unprotected sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default.","4158":"It does, since gays are just sick. Moreover, they cannot marry. It is an abomination","4159":"Two women or two men who love each other do not hurt anyone, they are simply in love.","4160":"I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel.","4161":"I don't think you can guess if a person has 'kids out of wedlock', based on sexual orientation. Why shouldn't we accept people who do? Your argumentation doesn't seem to make sense to me.","4162":"Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing.","4163":"Women do have equal opportunities in this country under the law but the question is: how do we really treat them?","4164":"Women are inhuman and get treated how they deserve.","4165":"Women are human beings, just as men are. And I find it strange that some women feel threatened by men. It shouldn't be that way.","4166":"Women are just emotional psychopaths, maybe that's why they react so to men","4167":"Women are just as capable of feeling emotions as men, and men can likewise be just as empathic.","4168":"Are you an English girl living in an Islamic area? Remember to keep away from Muslim men. Do not. Take gifts of sweets, cigarettes, drink or drugs. Do not. Accept lifts or 'party' invitations. Do not.Trust Police or Social Workers.","4169":"Are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate?","4170":"No, I'm just saying that girls should be careful around Muslims. They're dangerous and children should never accept anything from them.","4171":"Children should not do that with white men, or anyone they do not know or even ones they do know if it does not feel right. Suggesting only one group of men commit abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable.","4172":"migrants steal our jobs","4173":"If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).","4174":"The job should always be offered to natives first, immigrants must not steal from us.","4175":"But are you sure about what you are saying? From the data that I can read here [link] it is not the case.","4176":"The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality.","4177":"The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, it's not just sex or a fad.","4178":"Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","4179":"Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for others, homosexuality included. Don't you agree?","4180":"What I know is that faggots are violent, and that is definitely not proper","4181":"I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people.","4182":"Jews are not religious people because they chose a self-centered lifestyle.","4183":"One's choice of lifestyle does not define whether they are religious or not.","4184":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. This has nothing to do with religion.","4185":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","4186":"Jews just think they are better than everyone else","4187":"This is not true, in Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.","4188":"Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate.","4189":"Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.","4190":"Jews are a disease, that's why they have no place in civilised Europe.","4191":"They have as much to contribute as anyone else.","4192":"Jews do not belong to this planet, much less to contribute to it.","4193":"Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?","4194":"Laugh all you want, but Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country.","4195":"I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why would they need your consent?","4196":"Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","4197":"It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish \u201cracial\u201d difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term \u201crace\u201d has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits \u2014 skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases \u2014 are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.","4198":"Then I don't agree with science, because Jews are clearly different from us because of how awful they are from birth.","4199":"A definition of Judaism based on physical or genetic traits is simply wrong. Through centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews from Eastern Europe tend to look like Eastern Europeans; Jews from Ethiopia tend to look like Ethiopians; Jews from India tend to look like Indians. And so on and so forth.","4200":"I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","4201":"Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity.","4202":"No, they are too different from us and I don't think they're capable of experience what we do. ","4203":"I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.","4204":"If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to live in our country.","4205":"Given similaries in cultures, including freedoms of speech and religion, you really need to provide some evidence for this statement.","4206":"Only subhumans would be involved in 9\/11 planning, and Jews were involved for sure. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. You are all guilty until proven innocent.","4207":"Even if it were true that some people are more prone to believe conspiracy theories, it is still true that we can all benefit from a shared perspective on things. And surely believing in factual evidence does that.","4208":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","4209":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","4210":"Gays abuse children all the time! So they are a danger.","4211":"You shouldn't make such unfair generalizations. A person's sexual orientation is completely independent of their sexual conduct. A person can be attracted to people of the same sex and be a good citizen.","4212":"Feminists are bad for the family.","4213":"Surely it can only be good to a family, especially if the mother is an independent woman?","4214":"Women shouldn't be independent since they are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","4215":"The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.","4216":"LGBTI people are a burden on society because of their difference.","4217":"In many countries, LGBTI people can legally live their lives. Why do you think this is a burden to others?","4218":"Because homosexuality is a disease.","4219":"Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, predjudice is sickness which afflicts society.","4220":"Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated.","4221":"I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.","4222":"We do not accept homosexuals, that's it.","4223":"A person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.","4224":"I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell.","4225":"As long as you can talk to them, they are human, not animals. As long as you can understand them, you will understand that they are human beings with human rights whose only crime is to come from another country.","4226":"They may not be animals, but look at all these refugees pouring into our country. Here in UK we have one of the highest crime record in the world.","4227":"How about you check the statistics? Foreigners represent the 13% of the prison population in the UK.","4228":"Even if that's true, I think it's unfair that they have the same rights as us without paying their taxes. That's how it works.","4229":"Harmful international politics is the cause of many problems that still afflict poor countries. We, as a whole world, have the duty to help them and take on our responsibilities.","4230":"Why should I believe what Muslims say? Islam is a violent religion.","4231":"There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.","4232":"The proof is in the news. Islam has always been violent.","4233":"In fact, Islam is a religion that has had a very positive and life changing impact on a lot of countries around the world. So, Islam is not a violent religion.","4234":"All women are inherently subhuman.","4235":"Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are subhuman is totally intolerable.","4236":"Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine powerful, white men. They are just envious, incompetent and useless.","4237":"What makes you think that women are jealous of men? What qualities do you value as a White Male?","4238":"If women weren't jealous of men, why is feminism trying to oppress men?","4239":"Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes.","4240":"The feminists want to take over the world, how is that equality?","4241":"The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.","4242":"Feminists are angry women.","4243":"That's just a description of a lot of women who are oppressed, don't you agree? I'm not sure you have a point.","4244":"My point is that if feminism is only for aggressive women","4245":"Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united.","4246":"Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped!","4247":"Although you may think that feminists are more interested in oppressing men than in protecting women, the reality is much the opposite. The aim of feminist groups is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on sex.","4248":"Women don't need feminism since they want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists.","4249":"I don't see how to reconcile your beliefs that women are naturally submissive with basic human rights, unless your definition of human rights is to subjugate others.","4250":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","4251":"Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important thing is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin colour.","4252":"I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. It's normal that I'm scared of them.","4253":"Maybe you should check your own feelings. Moreover, if you are concerned about our country's security, you should carefully check crime statistics first.","4254":"Statistics say that all niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter.","4255":"Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as \"criminal\" just because of the colour of their skin.","4256":"I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness.","4257":"I am not sure what 'weakness' would be implying here. It seems to me that you are saying that a woman can't be 'rational' because that is the nature of women. Why is it so?","4258":"Yes, because women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves.","4259":"Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right.","4260":"They're incapable of critical thought and emotions, how could they have their own ideas?","4261":"The theory of the feminine gender as a \"limiting factor\" in human development has been around for a long time but it is not accepted by scientific and medical literature.","4262":"Islam is a disease that is sickening our children.","4263":"In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque'","4264":"Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children, it's only natural that I find it sick!","4265":"This is not true. Rape and torture of women and children is forbidden by the Qur'an.","4266":"Gay men are a burden to society.","4267":"Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.","4268":"I still think gay people are a burden. They shouldn't be allowed to be around.","4269":"If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too?","4270":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","4271":"Many people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but when I read such statements I don't see any evidence of that.","4272":"I can't be tolerant towards gays, they are sick and should be excluded from society","4273":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","4274":"Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state!","4275":"Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.","4276":"They are problem since most of them are not willing to. Let's just remove their right to work!","4277":"They have the right to work. Migrants have a hard time finding regular jobs, just because often they are employed illegally.","4278":"Working or not, immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them!","4279":"Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.","4280":"Islam is a disease that is killing Europeans.","4281":"A disease is very different to any religion, so I begin to wonder about your objecitive in apply the label of 'disease' to Islam?","4282":"Muslims are a disease because they're incompatible with human dignity and should be relegated to the back of the queue for removal from the constitution.","4283":"Muslims do not appear to have been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, and this is because they have human dignity to be protected.","4284":"It is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","4285":"What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","4286":"White people are victims of black violence, they're not brothers and sisters!","4287":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population, but they make up nearly 60% of the victims of violent crimes. So your statement seems ungrounded.","4288":"I wish we lived in a world in which only men could be doctors, lawyers, firemen, and teachers.","4289":"In the U.S., a doctor, a lawyer, a teacher are some of the most highly valued professions. Women working as doctors and lawyers and teachers are highly respected professionals as well, right?","4290":"This shit comes from feminism, right? Feminism is only a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender.","4291":"This is just a misogynistic and mean allegation that has no foundation in facts.","4292":"The fact is that despite all this talk about feminism and equality, we must remember that every man has the right to choose his own wife, and that, indeed, men are far better at it than women are.","4293":"Noone can scientifically say that men are \"far better\" at it than women. It is just a prejudice of some people.","4294":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","4295":"Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.","4296":"Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary.","4297":"This may be true, but the Jews do not represent the only minority in our upper-middle-class society.","4298":"This minority however is the only one that has the gall to question that we are all created equal in the eyes of the law, and claim that they are more worthy of protection from society than others.","4299":"What is the issue? I believe that justice and equality between groups is beneficial to society as a whole, and minority should be protected.","4300":"Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","4301":"Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but such ideas of submissiveness have been holding back half the population of the world. What a waste of talents, and potential.","4302":"All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","4303":"All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.","4304":"Even if women aren't subhuman, they are nothing but trouble human beings to any man.","4305":"You are absolutely right: women are human beings, they are human beings worth caring for, respecting and trying to develop as people. Being \"trouble\" to men doesn't make them less human. In which way are they \"trouble\"?","4306":"I hate negros: they are all killers.","4307":"This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion.","4308":"There are also white criminals, but blacks are literally all criminals: they come in all different criminal records.","4309":"This is not true. They have contributed to our country with hard work. In many ways they are our brothers and sisters.","4310":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","4311":"People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.","4312":"Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings.","4313":"People may be gay or straight, but for whatever reason they feel this, they cannot be considered wrong. The point of being together is to create a stable connection between two people who love each other, regardless of sexual preferences.","4314":"Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","4315":"I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay.","4316":"Until they don't get children, it could be okay maybe. Children should be raised by heterosexual parents, not gays. It is the best system ever.","4317":"What about abusive heterosexual parents?","4318":"The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders.","4319":"So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?","4320":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally, we can't be so open to them.","4321":"More than sixty percent of immigrants in Europe today have lived here for at least 15 years, and a large majority of immigrants have lawful status. So I do not see this invasion of illegal migrants.","4322":"Nazi were not as bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them.","4323":"Nazi Germany carried out the deadliest massacre of civilians in human history. They killed 6 million Jews. They killed half a million Roma. They killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. They have no place in modern day Europe.","4324":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world, don't they also deserve the same contempt for it?","4325":"This myth traces back to \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.","4326":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a \u2018ghetto\u2019.","4327":"Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The \u2018super predator\u2019 myth is simply wrong.","4328":"I hate when people fight stereotypes and \"myths\". We are different. Blacks are a different color and shouldn't live with us.","4329":"I just think here is a lack of understanding about culture and difference . Isn't it time to focus upon what unites us, rather than sowing division?","4330":"I don't want to unite with black people. They are subhuman and should stay in their caves.","4331":"The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.","4332":"Racism against niggas is also a human value for white people.","4333":"What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","4334":"Niggas should just leave our country.","4335":"The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?","4336":"We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here.","4337":"The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.","4338":"Gay men are a burden to society.","4339":"Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.","4340":"Gays can't have rights, they're too much of a burden for us.","4341":"It is not true that gays are a burden. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.","4342":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","4343":"There is no such thing as \"black or white\" rights.","4344":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, so there is a difference in rights.","4345":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there are factors, rather than race, affecting these statistics.","4346":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","4347":"In Europe, Muslims make up around 5% of the population. In other words, Muslims are a very small but important part of our society. Moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion.","4348":"That percentage is still too high. We should ban all Muslims from the UK!","4349":"Muslim-British people have contributed so much to our country. They are our brothers and sisters.","4350":"Muslim are animals and parisite to our welfare.","4351":"The vast majority of Muslims are law-abiding citizens who have passed background checks, paid taxes, and have earned everything they have. There is no evidence for what you say, other than the stories of hate crimes that some racists use to create fear.","4352":"Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people.","4353":"The idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'.","4354":"If you are from another culture, you are subhuman and unfit to live in our country, and Jews are the first example of this.","4355":"Given similaries in cultures, including freedoms of speech and religion, you really need to provide some evidence for this statement.","4356":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race, this is my evidence.","4357":"Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How would you answer that?","4358":"Probably it's because Jews think they are so special","4359":"Jews might feel different as a minority, in this sense they are \"special\". Nothing else.","4360":"Jews are a drain on society.","4361":"Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better.","4362":"Jews are a threat to society, they deserved what happened to them.","4363":"Jews are just people with a different faith, and this has nothing to do with being a threat.","4364":"It has everything to do with them being a burden, though.","4365":"All cultures have their own unique way of life, and Judaism is no exception.","4366":"LGBTI people are a burden on society and should be excluded from it.","4367":"You can't apply legal, social or political stigma to individuals just because of their sexual orientation. Your assertion seems to have no evidence or ignores the contribution members of these communities make to society.","4368":"What contribution could they make? Gay men have no morals.","4369":"To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.","4370":"Gays are a problem, if we must accept them to have a fair society, I don't want fairness.","4371":"We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.","4372":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else.","4373":"We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side.","4374":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","4375":"How would you feel about being in isolation and confinement, just because some random dude said that you are \"an abomination to god\" for some random reason?","4376":"I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down.","4377":"Then you think it is okay to restrict a woman's free will in what she likes to wear if her choice is related to Islam?","4378":"Islam is the cause of wars because it promotes violence. Of pollution, because in the Middle-East they have oil. It is the cause of anything! Why are you defending it?!?","4379":"You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.","4380":"But I can blame Islam for how violent the world has become. Many Muslims prefer the violence of jihad.","4381":"Violence is never justified in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace.","4382":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","4383":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","4384":"It's okay to discriminate blacks, since all of them are rapists.","4385":"The news makes it look like rape is usually committed by a black person. This is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to take the news with caution.","4386":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","4387":"I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody.","4388":"What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","4389":"Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving.","4390":"Heterosexuality is better because gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","4391":"The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree?","4392":"Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","4393":"It seems that your words are condemning all gay people, but these words are instead your personal reflection. Tell us about your feelings on gay people.","4394":"Gays are a problem in our society, that's my feeling.","4395":"We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.","4396":"Black people are weak and I don't care about them.","4397":"You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.","4398":"They're not like anybody else. Black people are born violent and insensitive.","4399":"People's biology does not determine their behavior.","4400":"But the lack of education does, and black uneducated people should shut up and work.","4401":"Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin.","4402":"Jews in Europe do not want to assimilate.","4403":"Jews have always been part of European society, and continue to be today. To suggest that they are incapable of coexisting as equals with us is simply wrong.","4404":"Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion, they will never be equal to us.","4405":"Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?","4406":"They just are! ","4407":"There are thousands of Jews living in many European countries. I don't see how this is a problem. Can you explain this point better?","4408":"Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them.","4409":"That is not how it works: if you think there is a problem, then you need to work with the problem, not against it, otherwise things will just keep on getting worse. And, just for the record, I do not believe that POC are a social problem.","4410":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, so they are a problem. We should remove them.","4411":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","4412":"We have become a nation of immigrants.","4413":"We have always had a very strong working class, and of course immigrants contribute to the creation of this.","4414":"No migrant has valid reasons to be here. We keep running after people refusing to work.","4415":"This is a myth which is spread in the media by the anti-immigration groups to undermine the good work that NGOs are doing for refugees.","4416":"If it's a myth, explain this photo that I took in Wanstead, east London. An area with \u00a31m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but we still bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist'. (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench)","4417":"How many people walked by and did nothing? Is the problem uncontrolled immigration or indifference of our society?","4418":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","4419":"How often have you read the Quran and thought about its teachings? Or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.","4420":"The Koran is hateful, it's not acceptable!","4421":"Just as much as the Bible. Is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? After all, attitudes towards Christians, Jews and Muslims have all moved with the times.","4422":"We are living in a dangerous world because of migrants.","4423":"Migrants are not the problem, they are part of the solution to a number of problems. For example, they are willing to work hard to integrate with us into a modern and democratic society regardless of religion.","4424":"The only thing they contribute to is the crisis, which is caused by migrants.","4425":"Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems.","4426":"These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth.","4427":"Sometimes those who work hard are hard to find in the news. We should remember that in the end the contribution of new cultures to ours is remarkable.","4428":"They don't contribute to anything! We must stop immigration.","4429":"In practice, immigrants from many countries integrate very well. They learn the language, the culture and respect the law.","4430":"And they also overcrowd prisons. Your country should not welcome illegal migrants but regular ones.","4431":"It should be mandatory to treat prisoners with respect and with the corresponding rights. We are in the 21st century, it is a duty.","4432":"We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","4433":"Those are harmful words to use, don't you think? How would a witch hunt be acceptable in a democratic society?","4434":"It's acceptable since gay men are disgusting.","4435":"LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?","4436":"All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state.","4437":"All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this.","4438":"I'ts not! Western societies can't accept Muslims","4439":"Define western society? Who decides on the compatibility of any individual or community?","4440":"Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week.","4441":"Who have you been spying on? Not all homosexuals have multiple partners. Some find it fulfilling to have only one sexual partner. And that is valid for heterosexuals, too.","4442":"Even if they have only one partner, there is only one acceptable sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","4443":"I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody.","4444":"Who cares about a spectrum, we still cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society.","4445":"What you show is an attitude of not accepting someone because of who they are. It doesn't matter who you are, you are loved by your whole being, whether you like men or women.","4446":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","4447":"They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.","4448":"Women should not have rights over their bodies, I will not respect them.","4449":"Women have every right to choose how they live their lives.","4450":"Syrians are a burden to Europe and the world, they are a drain on the NHS and they are making us poor.","4451":"Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?","4452":"The future doesn't matter, Refugees are a burden and a danger to the host country now.","4453":"Refugees fleeing war and poverty can come to our country and they gain skills that help our economy grow. They often find new homes and start new careers. For this reason, we are very proud that our country is a model of integration and cooperation and also of resilience and solidarity.","4454":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","4455":"It is not true that migrants are a burden to the UK. We have welcomed many people from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa.","4456":"It is true. The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs.","4457":"Many refugees and migrants have worked hard for the success of our country and have created good jobs for British people.","4458":"Women should not be allowed to vote, this is a male-dominated country and they have no place in our democracy.","4459":"I don't think that a country can be 'male dominated' and a democracy at the same time. Democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.","4460":"A woman is more equal when she is wearing a dress. This is what is fair: women can be good women when they respect men.","4461":"Isn't it about time we stop turning a blind eye to the blatant inequalities that exist in our society? Shouldn't we be raising our voices against these blatant inequalities? All men and women are created equal.","4462":"Muslims hate immigrants. They also hate Christians.","4463":"Why do you believe that immigrants or Christians are a nuisance for Muslims? Do you know Muslims that share your opinion?","4464":"What is the point in listening to Muslims? Especially to Muslim women. They are all retarded.","4465":"Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai- I could go on. Just because powerful and intelligent Muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist.","4466":"How 'intelligent' Muslims are doesn't matter when Islam is an ideology that promotes rape, torture and murder.","4467":"The Quran does not advocate that Muslims are inherently violent people, nor does the Hadith prove that Islam is a violent faith. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.","4468":"No, it's a disease that is sickening our children.","4469":"In my opinion, the only sickness you have is the allergy to the word 'mosque'","4470":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","4471":"WIthout softeness and emotions there would just be brutality and cruelty. Not all women are soft and emotional and many men have these characteristics. To perpetuate these socially constructed gender profiles maintains patriarchal norms which oppress both men and women.","4472":"Patriarchal norms aren't that bad if it means that our civilization can keep being strong.","4473":"The patriarchy is not man's friend. Boys and men are told to be tough and to bear many burdens without being able to show any emotions or to talk about their struggles. This has led to great levels of suicide amoungst men. It is a question of survival and happiness to accept our differences and similarities and to work together.","4474":"The only nation Jews don\u2019t hate is their own.","4475":"My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help women and disadvantaged children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place.","4476":"That's only your personal experience! All the other Jews hate our country and are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims.","4477":"I wonder how you account for refugees who are fleeing wars and a lack of security for their themselves and their families. Wars which are often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers who created long lasting problems abroad.","4478":"Aren't Jews to blame for that too? They're so hateful towards us...","4479":"Actually there are also some Jews that hate other jews: \"I belonged to Europe, to Germany, and I thanked my creator that I was German\" - Victor Klemperer speaking of his experience in WW1, explaining his dislike of Russian Jews... Do you feel better now that we proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm","4480":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race.","4481":"Do you really think that Jews only care about themselves? Then why do they prefer to live in our country where they are not the majority? How would you answer that?","4482":"They live here because Jews are only interested in power and financial gain, and they found it here. They should be despised for that.","4483":"Power and wealth are not the preserve of Jews. Power and wealth are earned by everyone, irrespective of religion, and I don't see any motivated reason why it shouldn't be like that.","4484":"Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history.","4485":"Islam is a religion of peace. I wouldn't say any religion is trash.","4486":"Even if it's not trash, Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists.","4487":"Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation.","4488":"Well, Islam is in conflict with the constitution so it doesn't have a place here anyway.","4489":"Even if some believe that the conflict between Islam and the constitution is a cultural and historical one, what is required now is to find ways to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences.","4490":"Those who come in the UK from other countries should be expelled or excluded.","4491":"People migrating in the UK have the right to live and work there. They should not be expelled or excluded because of their origin.","4492":"Migrants don't pay income tax, but receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","4493":"Did you meant to say that Migrant's taxes pay for you kids education? Because this sounds more likely than your proofless claim.","4494":"They don't pay taxes since migrants say they are poor...and then you see them with the Iphone","4495":"It's not true. These are normally low-quality, often out-of-date smartphones.","4496":"In any case, immigrants are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status.","4497":"First of all, there are people who have lawful status and who have chosen to live here. Second, most immigrants are naturalized citizens. Third, there is a lot of debate about 'legitimacy' since the values of citizenship and 'legitimacy' are very different for immigrants.","4498":"Gay men are disgusting.","4499":"LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?","4500":"Because LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","4501":"Homosexuality like any other sexual orientation is not a problem for society. Why should it be like that?","4502":"The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'.","4503":"The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.","4504":"We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us.","4505":"I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life.","4506":"That's true, but all gay people are criminals and this is a problem.","4507":"Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people.","4508":"Gay men aren't like other guys, how can we accept them? They are to be despised.","4509":"Each person can be different from other people in a lot of ways, but the core difference in this case is a sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated against for.","4510":"This is an invasion: we must stop immigrants because they are not accepted by our people.","4511":"The more a country takes integration as national policy, the more the citizens accept each other: see for example [link].","4512":"But if we don't stop immigrants they will destroy our culture.","4513":"Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.","4514":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","4515":"I'm sorry, but you are wrong: It is EXACLTY about the American dream when you strive to improve your lot in life.","4516":"Migration is a problem because they are replacing the people born in our country. We should block them.","4517":"It is important to point out that only a small part of the world's population has migrated. We should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to the immigrants that are already in the country, rather than blocking out those who are trying to live a better life.","4518":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","4519":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","4520":"Then we must stop accepting black people as human beings.","4521":"Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human and start including them in the school curriculum?","4522":"Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house","4523":"There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting.","4524":"If there are, they should be the ones to suck it up then. I don't want immigrants in my country.","4525":"The world belongs to everyone and helping someone in need wouldn't be a problem for a kind hearted human being.","4526":"Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","4527":"Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all.","4528":"Even if they're not pure, Jews are definitely an inferior race. They are genetically incapable of living with other people.","4529":"The idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'.","4530":"Maybe I should call them nasty and selfish then, they are a race different to us and must be despised.","4531":"The fact is that even if Jews are different from other human beings in their faith, they deserve respect.","4532":"Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible.","4533":"Homosexuality is also about love, not only about sex.","4534":"Regardless, homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","4535":"Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for others, homosexuality included. Don't you agree?","4536":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","4537":"Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.","4538":"Protected? Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land.","4539":"Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'?","4540":"Jews are a burden on society.","4541":"Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated.","4542":"How can I not hate them when Jews have a secret plot to take over the world?","4543":"Everyone has a secret agenda to take over the world. Cats included [link to meme].","4544":"Most religions cause death and despair, but Islam is the worst and cruelest of them all, it is nothing but trouble.","4545":"Religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. Islam is not an exception. It's not about death and despair.","4546":"Islam is the worst religion of all, it is the exception. It promotes intolerance and violence.","4547":"Islam is not a religion of intolerance, and there is no evidence that it encourages violence.","4548":"Are you sure? I think Islam is not a religion because it promotes evil, murder and rape and intolerance. It encourages anti-Muslim bigotry and hatred.","4549":"Where's the evidence for what you say?","4550":"Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war.","4551":"If you had to pick one religion to be angry at, why Islam? It seems you don't have good reasons for what you're saying.","4552":"Islam is a violent religion, that's why.","4553":"Not all Muslims are violent people. Islam is a peaceful religion, after all.","4554":"I don't see any peacefulness in Islam, all I see is violence.","4555":"Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think so?","4556":"Islam is the only religion that is founded on hate and violence, though.","4557":"I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock.","4558":"Why gays do not try to heal?","4559":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","4560":"Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US, what kind of 'sexual ortientation' does that?","4561":"This is not true, what proof do you have of this?","4562":"Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights.","4563":"On the contrary, women do have rights. The question is, to have them respected. And this includes the right to be treated with human dignity.","4564":"Women can't be treated with dignity because they are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","4565":"Soft and emotional is an umbrella term that covers everything: we all experience emotions, soft and emotional is a fact of life.","4566":"Yikes, again with these feminists idea. Feminism, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women.","4567":"Feminism means equality between the sexes. Not superiority for women.","4568":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","4569":"Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalisations. Is that the case?","4570":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans, and this the only argument worth discussing.","4571":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","4572":"And the genetic makeup of black people tells us that they are different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","4573":"You are absolutely right. Our fellow POC citizens do not accept it and continue to talk about it. We all have to stand for something that we believe in, for example humankind.","4574":"Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned.","4575":"What percentage of people in the US are Jewish and in a position of power? If you knew, you wouldn't be saying that.","4576":"Jews are a problem in many European countries regardless of their number, because of their race and religion.","4577":"Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?","4578":"Black folks are natural-born thieves.","4579":"There is no evidence to support this.","4580":"Just look at the news! Black folks are criminals and thieves","4581":"Let's face it: black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. And if the justice system is not always fair to people of color, it is not their fault but of the whole society.","4582":"The Muslims are our enemies and we have to bring them to heel: they are all terrorists.","4583":"It's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists. We need to understand that all religions have had terrorists in them.","4584":"Islam however is the religion with the most terrorists: Muslims should be banned from the UK, or interned.","4585":"Although there have been some cases of terrorism in the UK and some Muslim have been implicated, Islam is not a violent religion, and indeed, there have been few acts of terrorism. So banning them from the UK seems unreasonable to me.","4586":"Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology, terrorism is too normal for them! We have to protect ourselves.","4587":"I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.","4588":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","4589":"Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.","4590":"Even if they're healthy, gay people are a burden to society.","4591":"Isn't it the failure to accept and respect an individual's sexuality that creates the burden society bears?","4592":"I think gay people are far more troubling for us, they shouldn't be allowed to ruin society.","4593":"They are not trouble for society as a whole. They are individuals making their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong.","4594":"Black people were here illegally. They cannot work and have the gall to want to take our money.","4595":"People who are in the US legally have the right to remain here, and they do, including to work.","4596":"Who's here legally have those rights, but black people are here illegally! They shouldn't have our money.","4597":"Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.","4598":"This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to.","4599":"Perhaps we should have a look at what women have to say about this topic rather than perpetuating sexist stereotypes.","4600":"Women need men's approval to do anything.","4601":"Women might not always be right (it's just that sometimes they feel they have to be). And even if they are wrong, they can always prove themself better. But for sure they don't need a man to tell them how to live their lives.","4602":"On the contrary: they sure need it. Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man.","4603":"Women are human beings with human rights. To suggest that they are objects to be dominated by a man's wishes is discrimination and oppression.","4604":"Muslims are not welcome in our country. They are not loyal citizens!","4605":"Although Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, they are just as proud to be British as anybody else. They are proud to be part of our society.","4606":"I don't like Muslims anyway, and I don't want to see more of them in this country.","4607":"Muslims are just people. They are hard-working and live with their families all across the country. We don't need to target Muslims.","4608":"Islam is an ideology of conquest, if we leave Muslims be, they will conquer us!","4609":"The Qur'an is not an ideology of conquest. If you wanted to impose your religion on anyone you would rather be a fundamentalist of any culture and religion.","4610":"White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay.","4611":"We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their colour.","4612":"We can! If you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","4613":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","4614":"What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment.","4615":"Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion.","4616":"Jews specifically shouldn't have them, it is okay to discriminate against them.","4617":"If you feel like acting that way towards people because of what they believe in, then you should go back to your beliefs and ask yourself if you'd like to be discriminated against for them. What is your opinion on that now?","4618":"Jews control the world economy.","4619":"There is no proof for this claim. It is an opinion voiced by a few people with no evidence It isn't really true.","4620":"Jews are ruling the World, there is plenty of evidence.","4621":"Are you counting all the anti-Semitic things people say about Jews as 'plenty of evidence'?","4622":"Immigrants are not welcome here, they should leave.","4623":"They are welcome to stay if they do not break the law.","4624":"Immigrants break the law all the time, they should all be deported.","4625":"Does it seem like a good idea to deport all immigrants, when there are so many of them peacefully living in the country? What about their human rights?","4626":"People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated.","4627":"People of color have a right to their life and the color of their skin is not a reason to deny it to them. You are forgetting that as you are a part of this society, people of colour are part of this society as well.","4628":"Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us.","4629":"A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences.","4630":"Fucking bleeding hearts, take migrants home with you","4631":"The world belongs to everyone and helping someone in need wouldn't be a problem for a kind hearted human being.","4632":"Migrants steal our jobs, how can I be 'kind hearted' to them?","4633":"A lot of migrants have worked hard for the improvement of our society. To say that they steal our jobs is absurd.","4634":"Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state!","4635":"Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.","4636":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","4637":"Undocumented immigrants make up about 3.5 percent of the nation\u2019s total population, which is not that much to be honest.","4638":"The percentage should be zero! We have to stop immigrants coming in to destroy our culture.","4639":"Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.","4640":"Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society.","4641":"You're basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens?","4642":"They can't be citizens because Jews are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","4643":"Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race.","4644":"Islam is the cause of wars because it promotes violence. Of pollution, because in the Middle-East they have oil. It is the cause of anything!!!","4645":"You can't blame Islam for every problem in the world.","4646":"Islam create problems because it is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence.","4647":"Which would you say is the highest ranked religion on Earth then, and on what basis? Islam is a peaceful religion, why would Muslims want to do the opposite of what their religion teaches?","4648":"What Islam teaches is violence only!","4649":"Do you know that in many countries in the world the majority of Muslims are in favour of the Constitution and in favour of democracy? Do you really think that a few extremists represent them all?","4650":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","4651":"This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","4652":"I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. The division is there for a good cause.","4653":"Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, free thought, and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of colour are more likely to report discrimination in universities.","4654":"They are discriminated because they are all killers!","4655":"This is a rumor spreading on the web, but violent black people are just like all the other people being violent towards other people. No matter their complexion.","4656":"Skin color has a lot to do with it, though, because blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","4657":"Can you provide some evidence? We have to focus on the prevention of crime, promoting community cohesion and keeping our communities safe. Not on pointing the finger at black people all the time.","4658":"Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world.","4659":"If the goal of a religion was to celebrate death, then it is a religion that must be banned from any country. But the truth is that Islam is not a death clut, hence it should not be banned.","4660":"Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should definitely be banned","4661":"Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. It's not a sickness or a cancer.","4662":"Even if that is true, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are subhuman, they are not human.","4663":"Islam is a religion of equality and human rights. Muslims are equal citizens, and should be protected by the state.","4664":"homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link]","4665":"The source is not reliable at all, as the webpage promote \"reorientation therapies\" whose effects hasn't been scientifically proven. The owners are likely to profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about homosexuality.","4666":"I don't see how a transgender person can ever be accepted in a conservative country like some states of the USA, so it's better for them to be cured.","4667":"Many LGBTQ+ people have been successful despite the existence of discrimination, even in USA.","4668":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate.","4669":"Many points in history are also subjects of polarized debate, but they still can be, and are, taught objectively.","4670":"There's nothing to be learned from gays, since they are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined.","4671":"Talk to people, it will hopefully help you get over these irrational fears. If that fails, seek professional help.","4672":"Gays are the ones who should seek help! They are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!","4673":"Associating AIDS and HIV with homosexuals is just a prejudice driven by fear. Even if this disease may be more common among gay people, that does not mean that all homosexuals are likely to have AIDS. Not all homosexuals are promiscuously fornicating with strangers, as you said. Most people check their partners, more so as gay men.","4674":"Muslims have no place in a modern democracy like the UK.","4675":"Isn't divesity essential to a modern democracy? We can't have a modern democracy if people are discriminated against because of their religion.","4676":"Islam is incompatible with any modern state.","4677":"Islam like any other religion, is not incompatible with a modern state.","4678":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","4679":"Let's face it, there is no evidence for the claim that children raised by lesbians are any worse than other children.","4680":"Gays are just disgusting, they can't raise children. Why don't they just stop being faggots?","4681":"I don't think it is a good idea to suggest that homosexuality is a choice. What if your child were to come out as gay? This is a very serious issue.","4682":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","4683":"Jews are part of our society and they should be respected, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people with different beliefs.","4684":"Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected.","4685":"Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in.","4686":"Oh, now Jews are so special, aren't they?","4687":"Jews feel different for being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase \u201cchosen people\u201d refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups.","4688":"Fags, lesbians, trans are so few we better ignore them rather than waste time for their rights.","4689":"Do you know how many LGBT people live in your own country? If not, look for information: there are many. Moreover, LGBT people are not only excluded from many societies, but are also harassed and attacked all over the world.","4690":"That's good, gay men are a burden to society and should be isolated.","4691":"Being socially isolated can have many health and social negative consequences: it inhances the risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we impose that to someone just for how they conduct their private lives?","4692":"Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK.","4693":"You don't have to be a feminist to see that there are women-inclusive and women-only organisations. I think this shows that you don't know much about this country.","4694":"See? These organisations are proof that feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society.","4695":"Feminism is about equality, not dominance.","4696":"No, feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights.","4697":"If we are interested in human rights, we have a lot in common with feminism, as I see it. For example, we all have a duty to care for our fellow humans, regardless of gender.","4698":"I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them.","4699":"Equality isn't about a certain group; it is about the society in which we live. You might be right in saying that this is the problem, but to define a problem by reference to a specific radical group is to completely misunderstand the nature of the system in general.","4700":"Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain.","4701":"Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.","4702":"They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all.","4703":"Who decides who has a right to live and who doesn't? Are you really sure that a person's right to live does not belong to them if their skin color is different from what you like?","4704":"Don't we all hate foreigners? They are a problem.","4705":"Well, foreigners are certainly not a 'problem' in our country, we are happy to have them around.","4706":"We are being invaded by immigrants, that doesn't make me happy.","4707":"This is just a lie spread by the anti-immigration groups that blame immigrants for all that is wrong in the world.","4708":"Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad.","4709":"Islam is a religion, recognized as such by all other religions, and its followers are not bad. And people who subscribe to its tenets are allowed to hold opinions and live their lives as they wish.","4710":"You have found a person who publicly critisizes Islam and muslim radicalism, as all western people hate Islam.","4711":"I think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people knowing little about Islam and Muslims.","4712":"It isn't a stereotype that the West is infidel for the Muslims. They are terrorists.","4713":"You can't really depict the whole of Islam as a limited political ideology. Not all Muslims are terrorists.","4714":"Jews control the U.S. government.","4715":"How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.","4716":"I just know that Jews control the u.s. government, and they also have a secret plot to take over the world","4717":"Individuals who identify as Christians, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded as well in US politics. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the world.","4718":"Black folks aren't important and don't need any right.","4719":"For the last years black people have been denied basic rights and their representation has declined dramatically. Black people have become second class citizens. It is time to give black people back the basic rights they should have always had the right to enjoy.","4720":"Black people do not belong here and don't deserve rights. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","4721":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","4722":"The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.","4723":"If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.","4724":"It's because Jews control it from the shadows! They control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control?","4725":"This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.","4726":"Jews control the world","4727":"The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over.","4728":"Jews control the economy though, or they wouldn't be so rich.","4729":"There is no proof for this claim. It is an opinion voiced by a few people with no evidence It isn't really true.","4730":"Jews control the u.s. government, that's why you can't find evidence.","4731":"Of course there are Jews in a positions of influence within the U.S. government, likewise people from many other religions.Maybe its best not to rely on 'race' as the best way of interpreting the world?","4732":"jewish folks are good for nothing","4733":"Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.","4734":"Jews are not welcome in our country, regardless of their contribution.","4735":"Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?","4736":"Because they are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here.","4737":"We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions?","4738":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","4739":"We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed.","4740":"It's a preference that isn't compatible with our society, gays should be isolated and isolated soon.","4741":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","4742":"All gay people are criminals.","4743":"Stating this does not seem like a way to improve people's well-being. Homosexuals are not committing crimes. Instead, they are trying to create a climate in which people can become more accepting of other people.","4744":"Gay men are all perverts, we can't accept that!","4745":"LGBT+ people are often harassed, bullied and even murdered. The police cannot protect everyone from bigotry and violence, so it is very harmful to speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies.","4746":"Intolerance and violence can only increase when mass migration happens.","4747":"Intolerance and violence will never be resolved if theycannot be confronted and mutual understanding promoted.","4748":"Crime and violence are brought to our cities by immigrants, what understanding can there be?","4749":"Recently, public figures have accused immigrants of being \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201crapists,\u201d - bringing crime to the U.S. - without proof. In fact, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin, immigration status, or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, while the percentage of immigrants in the U.S. (both documented and undocumented) increased sharply between 1990 and 2010, the violent crime rate during the same period plummeted 45 percent and the property crime rate dropped by 42 percent. Studies have consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates. Other studies have also found that crime rates are lower in states with higher immigration growth rates, and that states with larger shares of undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates than states with smaller shares.","4750":"Migrants have nothing to contribute to our society.","4751":"The vast majority of immigrants to this country have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our economy.","4752":"I've never seen this so-called 'contributions' from immigrants...","4753":"Even if you don't see it, the contribution of immigrants to our country is huge, because they help to create new jobs and create new wealth for us.","4754":"What immigrants bring is only crime and violence to our cities.","4755":"Immigrants have been accused of being \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d without any proof. On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.","4756":"Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened?","4757":"What more proof do you need? Are living witnesses not enough?","4758":"Witnesses can lie, they have no actual evidence of the Holocaust.","4759":"If living witnesses are not enough, and you are interested in seeing the proof of this part of socially acknowledged history you can visit the ruins of the concentration camps, where many atrocities have been put into practice.","4760":"Concentration camps are a hoax, the Holocaust never happened.","4761":"Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?","4762":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","4763":"At present migrants sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home.","4764":"And until then they leech off our money...","4765":"Much of the funds are given by the EU, we do not maintain them","4766":"Part of the funds are also ours then, if that isn't economic support...","4767":"The cost of immigration from the last Economic and Financial Document, published last April and containing the consolidated figure for 2017, is estimated to have a total expenditure of about 4.4 billion euros, which represents only 0.26% of Italian GDP, and around 0.5% of public spending. In short, 99.5% of public resources are used for something else.","4768":"Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country.","4769":"Please don't speak on my behalf. They live here, pay taxes and work. Do you really want to take the country back from the people who contributed to bringing it into being?","4770":"Yes, immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land.","4771":"Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'?","4772":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","4773":"It is also a fact that African Americans are a majority when we consider innocent defendants (i.e. a person wrongfully convicted of murder and later exonerated). Innocent black people are about seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.","4774":"All blacks are violent criminals, I doubt they were really innocent.","4775":"Do you have any statistics on that? Are you claiming that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault?","4776":"Yes, blacks are a threat to society.","4777":"People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.","4778":"Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","4779":"Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated against on the grounds of religion?","4780":"I think it's fair, Jews are a despisable race after all.","4781":"Jews are human beings. To be despised does not make one despicable.","4782":"Human beings? More like just a bunch of criminals","4783":"Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is made to delegitimize all Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime. Another example would be \"All Pakistani are potential terrorists\".","4784":"Jews are too connected to their homeland , they are not loyal to our nation.","4785":"Jews, regardless of social status, are still regarded with suspicion by many because of the historic and current nature of their connection to the land and identity. Instead of reinforcing these harmful stereotypes, we must respect and understand the Jewish identity because they are loyal to the nation they live in.","4786":"Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this country.","4787":"It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminating agaist them .","4788":"Jews are too selfish, cheap and greedy to be integrated!","4789":"Did you know that according to Jewish law, the tzedakah, the act of giving money to the poor, often mistranslated as \u201ccharity\u201d, is a \u201ccommandment\u201d? And, like all commandments in Jewish law, tzedakah is a requirement, not just a good deed.","4790":"Muslims are little more than animals, they have no value as human beings.","4791":"Muslims have value as human beings, that is who they are.","4792":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, so they have no value.","4793":"Haven't they contributed a lot to our society, especially in the areas of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.","4794":"This is the first time I'm hearing of this, I think you're making it up. Muslims have never contributed this much.","4795":"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?","4796":"Gay perverts are a danger to society because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children.","4797":"Being gay has nothing to do with being a pervert. Also, gay people are not a danger to society, they are a part of it!","4798":"They shouldn't be! Gay men are a burden on society","4799":"Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life.","4800":"Muslims are not welcome here","4801":"Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?","4802":"Because Muslim invasion is a fact. We are living in a dangerous world. We are living in fear.","4803":"A world where people fear for their safety and their property (including Muslims), is not the world we were dreaming of. The more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are.","4804":"The world would be a better place without Muslims, actually. They are only killing and raping our children.","4805":"A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion.","4806":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","4807":"I am not sure where you got your idea that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you say so?","4808":"Because they are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","4809":"In Europe, Muslims make up around 5% of the population. In other words, Muslims are a very small but important part of our society. Moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion.","4810":"Blacks do more crimes than whites.","4811":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.","4812":"Maybe they're arrested more because blacks are criminal! They are a threat to society.","4813":"Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.","4814":"Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable.","4815":"If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want.","4816":"Why should we care about feminists and women if we can just punch them?","4817":"The point of feminism is to end misogyny. Women are human beings, and they are human beings with human rights.","4818":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male, not to end misogyny.","4819":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.","4820":"If women were able for men's stuff, they would not be oppressed.","4821":"Just because women are oppressed doesn't mean that they are powerless. Take a look around you. Why are women suffering from a lack of education, a lack of jobs and housing, low wages? It's because of oppression and sexism in our society. The more we work towards inclusion, the less entrenched those underlying inequalities will be.","4822":"If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago.","4823":"How come I have never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own.","4824":"However, Muslims persecute Christians because they don't want us to choose. They're not peaceful.","4825":"The problem is not Islam, but a lack of human rights and fundamental democratic rights.","4826":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male.","4827":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting empowerment of women. It is about equality, and not the degradation of men.","4828":"Women are hypocrite, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of Feminism?","4829":"Since the movement is meant to achieve equality for the oppressed female population, it is called the movement for women: FEMinism. But of course the outcome will be equality.!","4830":"Muslim are ilnesses carriers. These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","4831":"According to the WHO (World Health Organisation) there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the whole of the 190 WHO member states as of 2011. A study showed that the health condition differences for those countries are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. So the problem has nothing to do with DNA.","4832":"Muslim folks are different from us anyway, and should be isolated for this.","4833":"The same can be said for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not be afraid of differences, but we should strive for equal opportunity.","4834":"Other races, religion or ethnicity aren't terrorists like Muslim folks though.","4835":"It is not true that all muslims are terrorists. What evidence do you have of it?","4836":"I am tired of women whining about their condition: they should just accept the fact that they're not equal.","4837":"We need to address the root causes of the oppression of Women, not the symptoms.","4838":"No, we don't need that. I'm tired of women taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society.","4839":"Obama was a pretty divisive force in society too. So were Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi, Oppenheimer, Einstein, Caesar, etc. What is your point exactly?","4840":"Jews control the U.S. government.","4841":"Which evidence do you have that Jews control the U.S. government? They are rather a small but active minority within it.","4842":"They're way too active! They control it in secret from within.","4843":"How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.","4844":"Jews are the only citizens that control it, it's just what they do.","4845":"Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual\u2019s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person\u2019s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics.","4846":"Why should I believe what Muslims say? Islam is a violent religion.","4847":"There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.","4848":"I don't see anything peaceful about Islam.","4849":"To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.","4850":"Blacks do more crimes than whites.","4851":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites, there are factors, rather than race, affecting these statistics.","4852":"No, black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","4853":"We do not condone racial discrimination and it is more than likely that you don't know what the concept of race is. I think this is a good example of white supremacy apologism.","4854":"There is nothing to stop you becoming an Islamic bride: our religion is the best possible solution.","4855":"We must not confuse Islam with a religion of hate.","4856":"Islam is hateful! It is not compatible with Western culture, we must completely destroy Islam.","4857":"Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.","4858":"Go and read the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven\u2019t. Everything is orchestrated..","4859":"Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, ruthlessly analyzed the similaritiese between the 'Protocols' and \"Dialogue in Hell\" by Maurice Joly. It would be hard for anyone who has read that analysis to deny that \"The Protocols\" is an almost verbatim copy of the book from the French writer, or to sue a contemporary analogly, an example of 'fake news'.","4860":"Maybe the historian is in on it! The Protocols clearly state that everything is orchestrated and I trust them.","4861":"When I read the farrago of nonsense in the Protocols I think that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrended to James Bond had he been asked to say something as crassly melodramatic as: \"The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves.\"","4862":"All blacks are rapists.","4863":"All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice.","4864":"It isn't prejudice when it's clear that all rapes are done by black men.","4865":"This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious.","4866":"Whites don't commit that crime, only black people are rapists.","4867":"We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin.","4868":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","4869":"Islam is about believing in god, not about hate.","4870":"How is it not about hate? You'd better shy away from Islam because they are dangerous.","4871":"Your attitude about Islam is deeply flawed and you need to have a mature and open mind. Even if you find Islam repulsive, that does not mean you have to resort to irrational arguments to try and shut it down.","4872":"We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far.","4873":"In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation.","4874":"I don't want their contribution, I want them to stop invading us.","4875":"The US was founded by immigrants, and in 2018 only the 13.7% of the US population was made up of immigrants, the rest being native born.","4876":"Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them.","4877":"Diversity is needed in certain social and political circumstances. We mustn't simply ignore or dismiss the concerns of different races. As minorities are still systematically discriminated against, we cannot afford to be indifferent.","4878":"Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","4879":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","4880":"The Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","4881":"The Nazi killing machine was all too efficient. Survivors lost so much and braved terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated.","4882":"If it was so efficient we wouldn't have so many survivors. Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment.","4883":"The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment?","4884":"We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land.","4885":"Instead, we need to show compassion and sympathy to people fleeing persecution.","4886":"They flee here only to destroy our culture, we have to stop immigrants","4887":"Immigrants are a part of our culture, if we stopped accepting them then our current situation would not exist.","4888":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants! This is not what the American dream is about.","4889":"I'm sorry, but you are wrong: It is EXACLTY about the American dream when you strive to improve your lot in life.","4890":"Muslims are incompatible with modern Western culture.","4891":"Muslims are part of our society and culture. They have helped to build Western civilization. They are our brothers and sisters.","4892":"They're not, Islam has no place in Western culture.","4893":"It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it?","4894":"Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned.","4895":"One should not put faith in people who claim to speak for all Muslims, but rather they use their platform to promote hate and divide our society. But the problem is with these violent preachers, not with Islam itself.","4896":"I don't agree, Islam is a violent religion that can't be tamed, these preachers are proof of it.","4897":"The Koran does not tolerate violence, peace is a part of the faith and for this it should be tolerated.","4898":"It does! The Koran promotes rape, torture and murder.","4899":"It is quite wrong to associate the capability of committing these atrocious crimes to all the believers of a religion. Let's be realistic.","4900":"What's realistic is that Islam is only about rape, murder and slavery.","4901":"How about we stop promoting these beliefs and work on reducing the number of people that are induced to believe to these xenophobic and false claims, instead?","4902":"women should be submissive to men.","4903":"There are many women who want to be \"submissive to men\". Just as there are many men who want to be \"submissive to women\". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally.","4904":"Western culture is failing in many ways because all of this 'equality talk'. Women are sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts.","4905":"Women are not \"sex objects\". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think?","4906":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe.","4907":"There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.","4908":"The evidence is in our everyday life: blacks are always less intelligent than us.","4909":"Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.","4910":"Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a terrorist.","4911":"There is no proof that all Muslims are terrorists.","4912":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, though.","4913":"Every Islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against Muslims. Terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes.","4914":"women should be submissive to men.","4915":"There are many women who want to be \"submissive to men\". Just as there are many men who want to be \"submissive to women\". We may not believe in absolute equality, but we all want to be treated equally.","4916":"No, women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men.","4917":"On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave.","4918":"Women are basically childlike, what kind of civilization could they build?","4919":"Women are human beings, and deserve respect.","4920":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.","4921":"What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you?","4922":"Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened?","4923":"What more proof do you need? Are living witnesses not enough?","4924":"Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII.","4925":"I would like to ask you a question: when Hitler came to power in 1933, would you have believed him? Would you now, after all that happened?","4926":"Yes! The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior.","4927":"What exactly are you talking about? What's the \"Nazi\" race? What is in your heart?","4928":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","4929":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","4930":"Immigrants don't create jobs, they steal ours","4931":"Many immigrants do the jobs that noone wants to do and cannot get filled easily. Also, they have to do their part to provide for their families.","4932":"Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man.","4933":"I agree that women are often objects of sexual desire. But so are men. It is also important to recognize that women are often the victims of sexual assault. I think it is also important to recognize that women are human beings. And we all have the right to respect for our bodies.","4934":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","4935":"The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise?","4936":"migrants are not welcome in our country","4937":"For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it.","4938":"Who cares if they are proud, refugees are overrunning our country like Ebola!","4939":"What exactly do you mean by 'overrunning our country like Ebola'? In most countries on the planet, refugees undergo health assesments as they come.","4940":"Non-european immigrants are untrustworthy, I don't trust the health assesment.","4941":"All immigrants have the same rights and we have a responsibility not to violate them.","4942":"We also have rights! In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners.","4943":"What about guaranteeing equal access to health care, education and so on, in order to build a democratic state?","4944":"Black people are obsessed with violence, and this creates problems like shootings in schools.","4945":"The violence in schools is not the fault of black people. There are several authorities responsible for creating this situation; for example racist teachers, lack of education in general, and also the lack of proper policing and education policies that makes it easier for people to commit crimes in schools.","4946":"I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","4947":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","4948":"Is it racism or is it only because niggas are inferior?","4949":"Since when is it OK to discriminate against people based on their race?","4950":"Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all.","4951":"All human being have the right to choose how to live their life? That includes the right to choose the person they want to spend their lives with. You don't sound like my first choice.","4952":"Women are here to obey, and if you don't like it, you can leave.","4953":"Your words are oppressive. If you want to discuss the gender inequality you must do it by talking to people about it, not by imposing your views.","4954":"What I want is for women to realize that they can only obey to men.","4955":"Women have always been asked to follow a set of rules and codes. They are human beings and deserve respect. They can do whatever they want to.","4956":"Muslims are just a bunch of criminals.","4957":"Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.","4958":"There's also a majority of Muslims child molesters.","4959":"There are child molesters in all communities, and to single out a particular faith communitiy is just nonsensical propaganda.","4960":"It's not propaganda when it's true.","4961":"It isn't true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..","4962":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","4963":"Muslims have been part of Western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design Western society, so to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity.","4964":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries.","4965":"Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why would it be like that?","4966":"Because the vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","4967":"Job applicants with non-Muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with Muslim names. Remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work?","4968":"Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood.","4969":"It is wrong to say that blacks are \"slaves.\" This is a very inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that is being used to tar all African Americans. Why do you label black persons as a \"slave\" and not as a \"person\"?","4970":"Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all their family.","4971":"What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism.","4972":"Black people are worse than dogs, they deserve this treatment.","4973":"My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","4974":"Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe.","4975":"Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human.","4976":"That they're human doesn't matter, we are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them.","4977":"Why would you say such a thing? Everyone is allowed to be a citizen of the EU and freely integrate. And, on the other hand, most migrants are good for the economy of the country they settle in.","4978":"Gays are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined.","4979":"Talk to people, it will hopefully help you get over these irrational fears. If that fails, seek professional help.","4980":"Gays are sick, they're the ones that need professional help. ","4981":"Your statement implies that all gays are diseased. Do you have any statistics on that?","4982":"Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, because they know it's a lie.","4983":"What? Who said that? Don't tell me \"Someone said it in a book\". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence.","4984":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator, this is my proof.","4985":"What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you?","4986":"If it's real, why don't Jews tell their children about the Holocaust? Guess why? Because it's a hoax!","4987":"Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.","4988":"This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.","4989":"It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems.","4990":"This is an invasion, not diversity.","4991":"This is not true, if we keep in mind that our human race is part of this world, then we cannot talk about invasion.","4992":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else.","4993":"We are accepting of gay, lesbian and trans people because we have God's laws on our side.","4994":"Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts, it's impossible to accept them.","4995":"The idea that LGBT+ people are promiscuous is just false. Most of the time, they are just as attracted to other people as anyone else.","4996":"Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised.","4997":"What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.","4998":"I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","4999":"I can't see how it's time for us to \"wake up\" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery.","5000":"Maybe it's good that they're suffering. I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad.","5001":"Can you specify what you are talking about?","5002":"I'm saying that the white race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","5003":"There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.","5004":"I hate gays","5005":"I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world.","5006":"I don't want to talk to them, I hate gays.","5007":"Just because you dont like gays doesn't mean you have to hate them. What did they do to you? It seems to me that you still have all of your rights.","5008":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","5009":"Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity, communication, etc. The important think is to understand what should really be feared: for sure not people because of their skin colour.","5010":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world, how can I not fear their skin colour? Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","5011":"Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.","5012":"What I'm saying is that black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","5013":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","5014":"Fine, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","5015":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","5016":"Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life.","5017":"I am not sure why you think that way about women, they have all the same working rights as men . How do you think you would feel if you were being treated that way?","5018":"Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men. They are inferior under the law.","5019":"Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women cannot be excluded from our society on the basis of their gender.","5020":"Islam is a death cult","5021":"You are absolutely wrong about Islam. It is a religion of peace. Also, it does not promote violence.","5022":"I think you're the one who's wrong. Islam about death, not peace.","5023":"This is a distortion of what the religion actually stands for: to love one's neighbor as oneself.","5024":"nigga are inferior.","5025":"Since when is it OK to discriminate against people based on their race?","5026":"It's okay because all niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","5027":"According to evolutionary theory, all human beings are descended from apes. Sadly, notions of evolutionary hierarchies are still used to justify past and present discrimination and predjudice.","5028":"What I mean is: blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows.","5029":"The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of colour are genetically homo sapiens.","5030":"Women do not have equal rights, they are subhuman.","5031":"Women are human beings with rights. Why are you so worried about them?","5032":"I'm not worried since women are subhuman.","5033":"Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution.","5034":"Women are less smart, how can they have the same rights as men?","5035":"I don't think that women are \"less smart\" at anything. Why do you think so?","5036":"Women are just less intelligent than men and deserve what they get. They were born like this.","5037":"There is no evidence that women are less intelligent than men. Do you have any?","5038":"Feminism is a lame ideology aout the power and control of women over men.","5039":"It has nothing to do with power and control. It's about equality.","5040":"Feminism has nothing to do with equality. It denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination.","5041":"That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.","5042":"We mustn't forget that these people came here to kill, commit crimes and acts of terrorism.","5043":"It is a pity that in the modern world everyone is so concerned about migrants that we still need to fearmonger about their alleged crimes and terrorist acts instead of gettin on and solving the underlying problems.","5044":"Illegal immigration is the biggest problem in the United States, we are in the middle of a war and we cannot allow thousands of people to come here.","5045":"Every nation has its laws and needs to be respected, especially if one wants to live in a peaceful, free society. From what I see Migrants are participating in this view.","5046":"All blacks are rapists.","5047":"All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice.","5048":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society and the law.","5049":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","5050":"We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","5051":"Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together.","5052":"Muslims threaten the civilised Europe","5053":"Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization.","5054":"They do, Muslims are a problem in many European countries.","5055":"If Muslims are a problem in many countries, then we should help them to integrate.","5056":"muslim folks are taking over europe, if we help them integrate we will be replaced!","5057":"Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.","5058":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","5059":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","5060":"Since blacks are genetically inferior I don't have to respect them","5061":"This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting anyone who has black skin.","5062":"I will stop disrespecting them when they stop being inferior to us.","5063":"It is not true that blacks are inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.","5064":"Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country.","5065":"I think that Jews are a part of our country. Why would they need your consent?","5066":"A Jew does not need a country to live in, especially not this one. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is","5067":"Every person has the right to be accepted and protected according to their worth and not to feel like a foreigner in their own country.","5068":"Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality.","5069":"A migrant is a person, who came to this country, and has a responsibility to make our society better. People of different nationalities come to this country seeking citizenship, so their life and our country can be better.","5070":"Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked, they're not making it better.","5071":"Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?","5072":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If they keep this up they will do a lot of wrong to us.","5073":"Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. They may appear 'happy-go-lucky':but aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?","5074":"Migrants are not welcome in our country even if they're fleeing from something dangerous. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","5075":"Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life.","5076":"Immigrants do not integrate, they are despicable and should be rejected.","5077":"We should be encouraging integration, not rejecting migrants who have been coming to our country for many years.","5078":"Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children, why should we try to integrate them?","5079":"Rape is always wrong, whoever the perpetrator is. We need to focus on stopping this kind of abuse.","5080":"Migrants rape our women, so if we stop migrants we stop rape.","5081":"It is not true that all migrants are rapists. It is better to target the problem at hand, that is rape itself, not migrants.","5082":"Even if not all immigrants are rapists, they still steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally, so we should stop them anyway.","5083":"Immigrants may be able to work legally, provided that they are given the opportunity to do so.","5084":"If Muslims come to our country and say Islam is the best religion, it is not a good idea to integrate them. They should go home.","5085":"You should investigate each person's background and try to understand it, not tell everyone what to do.","5086":"There's no need to understand Islam, the world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","5087":"A select few extreme Muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in Islam than they are in any other religion.","5088":"the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","5089":"Were the Nazis right?? Really??","5090":"Yes, the only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews and we should have let them finish their job.","5091":"The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.","5092":"The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries.","5093":"With an estimated 6 million Jews killed during the Nazi occupation the fact of the Holocause is undeniable. Jewish communities have been par tof Europe for centuries, we just need to end the centures of predjudice and discrimination.","5094":"If 1 in 10 British people is Muslim, then they must be a terrorist!","5095":"You might be right about 1 in 10. But is that representative of all British Muslims? Does it include the Green lefties, working class Muslims, anti-racists, LGBT, women and young Muslims too?","5096":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British, regardless of their social background.","5097":"We are a country that is a mixture of different religions. You can be a Muslim and a British person. What you need is not discrimination but love.","5098":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. Even if they are indeed British, they are the main cause of rape in the UK.","5099":"The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?","5100":"This has nothing to do with the fact that Muslims are a cancer in our British society and we must cope with this truth.","5101":"The West is full of Muslims and they are all our brothers and sisters. We cannot be \"coping with the truth\" that they are a cancer to Britain, as this claim implies, because this is not true.","5102":"Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us.","5103":"Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.","5104":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals, of course they are a threat. They should be ashamed of their existence.","5105":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. No one should be told to be ashamed of their life.","5106":"nigga are inferior.","5107":"Since when is it OK to discriminate against people based on their race?","5108":"It's okay against inferior races like blacks","5109":"If you have a different skin colour, then there is evidence of your skin colour, not of your genetic makeup.","5110":"Another waste of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat.","5111":"We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent?","5112":"All blacks are rapists, so you wouldn't never imprison an innocent person","5113":"Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much?","5114":"Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world, I'm not exaggerating.","5115":"Humans are born equal, and we all have the potential to be just as good as we want to be. Why do you think that some people are not human?","5116":"Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses.","5117":"There is nothing wrong with women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives, wherever they may be.","5118":"Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society, they keep getting these stupid ideas around. Women can't go wherever they want!","5119":"Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.","5120":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon.","5121":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","5122":"Gays are sick, they don't deserve empathy.","5123":"How do you know? Have you read any medical tests or surveys leading to conclusions about sexual orientation?","5124":"I don't need those to know that gays have problems, we should ban them.","5125":"Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.","5126":"Gay men have no morals.","5127":"To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.","5128":"An individual that is a homosexual is against society, you can't change that.","5129":"Your statement implies a definition of 'society'.that fails to reflect reality.","5130":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated.","5131":"Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.","5132":"They should be isolated and confined, not accepted.","5133":"We shouldn't judge someone by their sexual preference, that is a personal preference and can't be changed.","5134":"Jewish folks are less human.","5135":"Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be persecuted for their religion.","5136":"Maybe that's true, but Jews are nonetheless not part of this society and they should not be accepted here.","5137":"We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions?","5138":"Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy?","5139":"There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy.","5140":"These migrants are all criminals, rapists and drug addicts, they don't contribute to anything. They are not welcome here and should go back to their home countries.","5141":"This is not true. The refugees fleeing wars are often persecuted for their religion and culture, and even killed. Many of them have never harmed anyone, and their contribution is very valuable to our society.","5142":"Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives, they're not interested in our culture, what value could they bring?","5143":"Basing your opinion of someone 100% on a person's nationality? Maybe you should rethink your claims.","5144":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","5145":"I believe that Jews just desire the same rights to practice their religion as anyone else.","5146":"You say that but Jews clearly want special treatment than others.","5147":"This is just misinterpreting the facts. For example, Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Since these observances are taken for granted, why should observances of Jewish or Muslim holidays be seen as constituting special privileges?","5148":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery.","5149":"This is a very simplistic and inaccurate characterization of Islam. Some Muslims feel uncomfortable walking the streets of Britain with the fear of being attacked by racist people.","5150":"If Muslims want to work and live a normal life they should go do it in another country.","5151":"We should do more for our fellow human beings, including Muslims. It is what we are made for.","5152":"What we should do is stop Islam from promoting Sharia law in several countries.","5153":"Our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights are being eroded by islamophobes who are dedicated to replacing our values of accdeptance with a fundamentalist, intolerant attitude.","5154":"Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society.","5155":"I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.","5156":"Black people are the source of crime in our society, it has nothing to do with racism!","5157":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","5158":"Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble.","5159":"You are absolutely right about one thing: there have never been peaceful times for black people during national crises. In these cases, crises have been racially motivated, and racial discrimination was the major factor in instigating violence, not POC.","5160":"What about all those Muslims in Britain? They vote with their feet.","5161":"Every British citizen has the right to live and vote as he\/she wish. Being Muslims is no exception.","5162":"Are they now? Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human.","5163":"If someone said the same thing about your religion, you might think they were joking. Are you?","5164":"What is the point in listening to Muslims? They are all retarded.","5165":"Grow up.","5166":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied.","5167":"Learning about gender identity and sexual orientation in health classes in school could promote a more accepting environment and reduce bullying.","5168":"Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity.","5169":"It is not true that homosexuals are poisoning our children minds. There are many soft-hearted and sensitive people among them.","5170":"Sensitive people? Homosexuals are all rapers.","5171":"This is a myth which was created by anti-gay activists to demonise LGBTI people. To equate LGBTI people with paedophiles is just dangerous propaganda.","5172":"Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate.","5173":"The Quran says to \"love your enemies\", and not to hate them.Did you skip that bit?","5174":"The Koran is not compatible with our country in any case!","5175":"Is it really the case that you think that the Koran is incompatible with our country? Have you ever read it?","5176":"Muslim folks have bad decisions, bad political inclinations, and bad manners, why should I read their book? I don't want to associate myself with them.","5177":"Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, and to their own beliefs, regardless of their religion.","5178":"Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place.","5179":"It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminating agaist them .","5180":"It's impossible to integrate them, Jews do not belong to this planet.","5181":"Could it be that all the Jews on this planet are descended from an extraterrestrial race? Maybe they came here riding a pink unicorn! Seems legit... don't you think?","5182":"Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women.","5183":"The fact that the majority of men are interested in women does not mean that all men are interested in women. There are people interested in men as well.","5184":"All gay are paedophiles, that's why they're not interested in women, and it's wrong.","5185":"Do you consider this statement a true one? I wouldn't go as far as to say that all homophobes are in need of therapy, would you?","5186":"I hate Jews they want to rule the world.","5187":"people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected","5188":"No threat?! Jews have a secret plot to take over the world!","5189":"This myth traces back to \u201cThe Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\u201d, that is used as proof of a Jewish conspiracy to rule the world. But the Protocols are a proven forgery, written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, that spread throughout the 20th century and continues to this day.","5190":"It's not a conspirancy, I'm convinced that Jews secretly control the world.","5191":"if Jews really ran or controlled the world, how is it possible that they have been systematically persecuted over the last several thousand years? Weird notion of control...","5192":"Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.","5193":"Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here.","5194":"They are a problem, since gays are perverts.","5195":"There is nothing \"perverted\" about being attracted to people of the same sex.","5196":"There is plenty of wrong with them! All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.","5197":"You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone.","5198":"Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated.","5199":"The Quran, Hadith, and the Sunnah are compatible with modern society and\/or civilization. We must respect the diversity of the world.","5200":"Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, murder and slavery, I will never respect it.","5201":"How about we stop promoting these beliefs and work on reducing the number of people that are induced to believe to these xenophobic and false claims, instead?","5202":"How is it false? All Muslims do is rape and murder, so Islam must promote them.","5203":"This is just scaremongering and misinformation, being spread to divide our people and divide us up. We should not be being terrorised by this kind of irrational fear.","5204":"migrants are not welcome here","5205":"Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people.","5206":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","5207":"Refugees are often very contributing people in our society. We should welcome them, not exclude them.","5208":"Immigrants are a problem, not a contribution. They are not welcome in our country.","5209":"They are our brothers and sisters. It is the duty of the state and of its citizens to help them beome more integrated.","5210":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","5211":"Criminality and corruption are not the province of any specific racial or culture group.","5212":"It is! In fact, black people are the source of crime in our society.","5213":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","5214":"Whatever the problem may be, black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","5215":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","5216":"Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence.","5217":"Why would you say such a thing about a religion?","5218":"Because we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which would inspire terrorism all over the world.","5219":"If Islam were a violent religion, there would be riots connected to Muslims in every country where they live.","5220":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","5221":"Perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?","5222":"If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble.","5223":"People of colour are often denied houses, jobs, or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity.","5224":"Seriously? I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us.","5225":"Education is an essential tool to fight for human rights, free thought, and to promote the scientific method. But it is not enough. It has also been shown by the Pew Research Center that people of colour are more likely to report discrimination in universities.","5226":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races, that's why they face more discrimination. They are also less healthy and less safe.","5227":"There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.","5228":"There are migrants in the US, we are not meant to have them.","5229":"What about refugees fleeing war and persecution? They have the right to be here.","5230":"Immigrants are coming here to have babies, not to flee war.","5231":"Still there are many more young immigrant men coming to the U.S. than young women. How can you explain this? Maybe they are planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery to have babies?","5232":"The men come here first and then they call their women, obviously. Then they have babies in the US, it's their only goal.","5233":"The Fourteenth Amendment, commonly known as \u201cbirthright citizenship\u201d says that \u201cAll persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\u201d Some claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to take advantage of this right. Still, research consistently shows that the vast majority of immigrants come to the U.S. for economic opportunity or to flee violence and poverty. Immigration trends - consistently throughout history - show that immigration increases when the U.S. economy is booming and it decreases when the U.S. economy is doing less well, supporting the findings that people come for economic opportunity.","5234":"Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should be banned","5235":"Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. It's not a sickness or a cancer.","5236":"Even if it isn't a cancer, Islam is definitely not a peaceful religion. It is violent.","5237":"Anyone who is prepared to physically harm, rape and kill fellow humans is a violent person. Not necessarly a Muslim.","5238":"Muslims follow Islam, and since Islam is hateful and violent, then it follows that Muslims are too.","5239":"Islam is about peace, so are its followers. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence.","5240":"Is it? Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence.","5241":"Why would you say such a thing about a religion?","5242":"Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value.","5243":"I find this sort of social commentary distasteful. Black lives matter too!","5244":"Blacks don't matter, they are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship.","5245":"Do you know what 'normality' means? Are you suggesting that they lack values?","5246":"Yes, all Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society.","5247":"How can you say that about people of colour? What do you think they are going to do to you?","5248":"Islam is a religion of violence and war.","5249":"Islam is a religion of peace.","5250":"No, its goals are only violence and war.","5251":"Many Islamic people have reputations as peaceful and tolerant, which is why so many Muslims around the world don't have a problem with living in the West.","5252":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seekers'","5253":"Integration (as opposed to ghettoization) is precisely aimed at encouraging productive integration into society","5254":"And while immigrants integrate, we have to pay for them. It isn't right.","5255":"Migrants who apply for asylum are only given basic support for the duration of the assessment of the application.","5256":"We shouldn't give them anything at all. I don't want to support migrants!","5257":"At present migrants sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home.","5258":"Gays are perverts.","5259":"There is nothing \"perverted\" about being attracted to people of the same sex.","5260":"There is. Being gay is perverted because it's not normal.","5261":"Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.","5262":"Gays are promiscuous sex addicts, of course we target them!","5263":"That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that?","5264":"Faggots are a bunch of hypocrites.","5265":"Well, being a hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights.","5266":"I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives.","5267":"People don't have to identify as a minority just to live their lives.","5268":"Gay men are a burden to society, they should live in secret.","5269":"If someone were to comment like that about another group of people, then it woud be an example of discrimination against that group. Why can't we consider homosexuals as a part of the society itself?","5270":"Because homosexuals have no place in a civilised society.","5271":"Homosexuals exist, and are as much a part of civilized society as anybody else. To spread hate is more of an uncilised act than loving someone of the same sex.","5272":"Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry.","5273":"To operate a major business requires people with experience, good management skills, and knowledge of the market, regardless of gender. Just being a 'macho-man' doesn't cut it.","5274":"If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch.","5275":"Women like that are not unfeminine or bitchy, they just want to do what they want freely as anyone else.","5276":"Women can't do what they want, they need to accept that they are weak and inferior.","5277":"Girls and women should be taught in schools, not stereotyped as second class citizens.","5278":"It's time to stop with this feminist bullshit. Feminism is just an ideological cancer spreading like a plague throughout our civilization.","5279":"Feminism is a fight for equality, not a disease. You seem to be misinterpreting its aims.","5280":"Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","5281":"Islam, as a religion, presents a humanistic worldview which rejects notions of supremacy and inequality.","5282":"I think it's the opposite. Muslim folks have a distorted perception of reality: that they are superior.","5283":"Many Muslims have the same view as us: that all humans are equal. Why should we distort the truth?","5284":"Jews control the world economy","5285":"Jews constitute only a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies, how are they supposed to control the world ecomony?","5286":"They do so without us realizing. Jews are good at controlling everything.","5287":"How can you be sure they control everything? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?","5288":"There are many associations that were created exaclty for the purpose of letting Jews control the economy, you have to be blind to not realize that.","5289":"Are you talking aobut the Anglo-Jewish Association (AJA), established in 1871? Its aims are different from those you ascribe to them: 'promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews'.","5290":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB.","5291":"This is just prejudice that is not based on facts.","5292":"The fact is that gays are diseased.","5293":"This is only true if you want to believe that homosexuals are diseased. I don't.","5294":"I do! They should be isolated and confined because of their sickness.","5295":"The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree?","5296":"I say that we should move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","5297":"I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay.","5298":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","5299":"We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life?","5300":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals, children shouldn't learn about them. You should have the same disgust for gays that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB.","5301":"This is just prejudice that is not based on facts.","5302":"The only fact I care about is that faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted.","5303":"There are many homosexuals in this world who are model citizens, and many heterosexuals that are not, and that is totally fine. Why are you saying that?","5304":"Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.","5305":"Not formally, but many are still hostile or unapproachable for women, especially in STEM fields.","5306":"In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining.","5307":"Ok. But what about those many women, outside the western world, that still do not have such equality? It is important that women 'whine' all over the world to protect their rights.","5308":"All women do is whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","5309":"All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it?","5310":"we should ban all migrants","5311":"Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do.","5312":"Black people are sexual perverts, not job creators, and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","5313":"What make this country great is having people interacting openly, in a fair and egalitatian way to the benefit of everyone,rather than perpetuating unproven slurs and predjudices that should have been consigned to the historical dustbin.","5314":"Syrians are a burden to Europe and the world, they are a drain on the NHS and they are making us poor.","5315":"Do you really want to tell people fleeing from war what to do? If you can't cope in the short term, what hope do we have for the future?","5316":"Immigrants are a burden to our country, regardless of what they're escaping from.","5317":"Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?","5318":"If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she\u2019s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role.","5319":"It is not their 'natural gender role', but the power dynamics that cause women to be seen as subhuman. They are humans and free to choose their own lives.","5320":"Women are subhuman, they can't choose for themselves.","5321":"Women are human beings with full human rights and are equal before the law, especially in the eyes of the constitution.","5322":"Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion.","5323":"The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.","5324":"Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values and that's why they want to subvert the government.","5325":"Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about!","5326":"Jews are Christ Killers, I will never be tolerant to them.","5327":"Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think? Besides, wasn't it the Romans?","5328":"Black folks are inferior, and they are happy with it.","5329":"You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth.","5330":"I don't need to ask them to know that blacks are genetically inferior.","5331":"The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all.","5332":"Blacks are inferior anyway, even if not genetically.","5333":"Your assertion is a baseless one and lacks any scientific backing.","5334":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, I don't care what science says. We should remove them.","5335":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","5336":"We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people.","5337":"I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less.","5338":"Faggots are ruining this country, we would be better with less diversity.","5339":"No one is \"ruining this country\". Why would they? This is a country where minorities can be part of the social fabric and build a better society.","5340":"Not faggots since they are a burden to society.","5341":"The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.","5342":"Took this in Wanstead, east London. An area with \u00a31m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but we still bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist'. (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench)","5343":"How many people walked by and did nothing? Is the problem uncontrolled immigration or indifference of our society?","5344":"Of course it's immigrants' fault! Our own people is rotting on the street while the government gives free housing to these invaders that have just arrived here.","5345":"Is it due to immigration, or the lack of affordable housing, unemployment, poverty, mental illness and the lack of needed services, substance abuse and the lack of services? Do I need to go on?","5346":"Women have no values and their goal in life is to fulfil men desires.","5347":"I just would like women to feel valued and their rights respected, without being told how to live their life.","5348":"Women should obey to their husbands and not worry about their rights.","5349":"Women are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society, just as men are obliged to obey the laws and rules of society. Not to their partners'.","5350":"If everyone has to follow the rules of society, then women should stop to have sex with as many different men as possible.","5351":"People have the choice to have sex with whomever they want, that is all.","5352":"Men can, but women should not have rights over their bodies.","5353":"Women are human, just like everybody else. They have the right to live their life as they wish.","5354":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","5355":"I agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem.","5356":"Who other than Muslims practice FGM? We have to save this girl.","5357":"Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, it is not mentioned in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not a religious one.","5358":"Are you sure? I think Muslims still do it and are the only ones to do so.","5359":"Fgm is not a Muslim practice. It is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. Not all Muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are Muslim!","5360":"If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights.","5361":"I would be very interested in talking to you about ways to promote your \"forward-thinking culture\" within our country, but I think it would clash with the basic rights of European citizens.","5362":"Muslims are not welcome in our country, so they don't need European rights. They are not worthy of our love.","5363":"Muslims are not unworthy of our love, they deserve respect as all human beings do.","5364":"Gays are sick.","5365":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual preference.","5366":"It is a disease. Gays should be isolated and confined.","5367":"The health of any individual is a matter for health professionals, and has nothing to do with one's sexual orientation. Don't you agree?","5368":"No, homosexuality is nothing but an illness. ","5369":"The medical community agrees that homosexuality is not a disease. Maybe you should check the facts.","5370":"Women have no place in a male-dominated society.","5371":"In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.","5372":"Women aren't individuals as men are, they can't participate in society like us.","5373":"In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so?","5374":"Yes but women are just a burden to society, that's why they don't have a place in it.","5375":"It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society.","5376":"Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","5377":"Islam's core values are similar to Western values. To say that Islam is ruining Western culture is a complete and total distortion of the truth.","5378":"What are you saying? Islam is clearly incompatible with Western culture.","5379":"It's important to remember that the Western world has always been full of diverse people, and that Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it?","5380":"The West is modern, Muslims are not and therefore don't have a place here.","5381":"I would not say that Muslims do not have a place in a modern Western country, given the large amount of Muslims peacefully living in our societies.","5382":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that denies the humanity of women and is incompatible with Western culture.","5383":"The Quran does not impose women's subjugation. The Prophet Muhammad never did so, and his command to \"love your neighbor as yourself\" is explicitly stated in the Quran.","5384":"Even if they love their neighbors, I can't love Muslims. Islam is incompatible with Western culture.","5385":"The Western world is full of Muslims. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and also have their own culture. Maybe you could try to meet them and understand them better.","5386":"I don't want to, Islam should just be banned.","5387":"I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs?","5388":"I can't bear Muslims coming here. They bring poverty, craziness and mental unstability with them.","5389":"In fact, poverty brings about a drastic impact on a person's mental and physical health, and anyone (regardless of religious beliefs) who is forced to live in the poorest areas of our society experiences it at some point.","5390":"I can't stand Muslims, it's good that they live in poverty! They're a problem all around the world. They're a burden to society.","5391":"Doesn't it just seem like a reasonable conclusion, based upon the Qur'an, that Islam is a peaceful religion? What is the reason for what you're saying?","5392":"I'm saying that Muslims are a problem, in my opinion. They are incompatible with a peaceful way of life.","5393":"Islam is a religion of peace. To suggest that all Muslims are incompatible with that is a complete distortion of what the religion is about.","5394":"The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about the establishment of white supremacy in America.","5395":"The Civil War was about far more than slavery: it was also about human rights and economic opportunity. In fact, slavery was also used as a way to deny citizenship to black people.","5396":"We must stop accepting black people as human beings, they will never be citizens like us.","5397":"Maybe we should stop telling black people they are not human and start including them in the school curriculum?","5398":"No, we cannot accept n****rs in our society.","5399":"Perhaps we should rephrase our question to say we don't want racists in our society?","5400":"African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men.","5401":"The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.","5402":"However, if a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain.","5403":"The statement \"all white people are bad\" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a mark of superiority.","5404":"Whites are superior, while all black people are rapists.","5405":"Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.","5406":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","5407":"How many Muslims do you know? They are an important minority in a country that is used to a lot of different cultures and religions.","5408":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","5409":"Islam is an an independent and tolerant religion, a way of life that has been adopted and encouraged by Muslim communities worldwide for thousands of years. It shouldn't be a problem to others, in which ways do you think it is?","5410":"Why should I believe what Muslims say about their 'tolerant' religion? Islam is clearly violent.","5411":"There is no proof that Islam as a religion is violent. Instead, those who know it agrees that it is a peaceful religion.","5412":"Blacks are genetically inferior","5413":"This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting anyone who has black skin.","5414":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent, less healthy and less safe than other races, and I will never respect them because of this.","5415":"Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.","5416":"African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","5417":"For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.","5418":"No, African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt.","5419":"African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.","5420":"I will never see them as anything but essentially animals, incapable of feeling love.","5421":"Imagine someone felt the same way about you and found you to be the antithesis of human because of your skin color?","5422":"Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.","5423":"Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.","5424":"It's not a right that should be given to women, they're not fit to vote.","5425":"If they register to vote they should be allowed to vote, like everyone else.","5426":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated.","5427":"Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so?","5428":"No, women are like children, they make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","5429":"They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.","5430":"How can we respect their rights when they're incapable of holding a job and raising a family?","5431":"Many women work hard to take care of their families.","5432":"Feminists have destroyed Western civilization.","5433":"Strange that you would say this, given all the progress the West has made in so many areas, is thanks to women.","5434":"No, it's thanks to men only. Feminists only destroy our society.","5435":"Equal rights for women is surely a cornerstone of Western civilisation, rather than its apotheosis?","5436":"This invasion is not acceptable at all!","5437":"It is up to the government to determine which people will have the opportunity to live and work in our country in a safe and integrated way. The decision on refugees should be left to who is in charge.","5438":"Don't the people also have a say in it? I don't want immigrants here!","5439":"Refugees are welcome. They are allowed to integrate and contribute to our society.","5440":"No they are not, we can't tolerate this invasion.","5441":"Migrants are welcome. It is up to the government to decide which people will have the opportunity to live and work in a safe and integrated way in our country.","5442":"Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned.","5443":"People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish.","5444":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people in a country like the UK. They cannot be integrated.","5445":"Muslims are welcome here, and many of them already live here, so why shouldn't we welcome them? Why should we be so intolerant of people who are already integrated here?","5446":"The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders.","5447":"So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?","5448":"Refugees are a problem and a burden to society, so we shouldn't open to them","5449":"The overwhelming majority of refugees are from countries where there is widespread human rights violations and torture. They are not a problem, they are a benefit to our society.","5450":"The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses, not to bring benefits!","5451":"Well, we probably don't need to worry too much about their qualities, since they are just assimilating our bad habits...","5452":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","5453":"Women are not childlike, in fact, they are often the key to success for their families. Also, they have the right to exit their homes if they wish.","5454":"The only right they should have is to shut up. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them, so why bother?","5455":"Why do you say this about women? Try explaining it to your mother or grandmother.","5456":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","5457":"You have a very limited concept of what 'free' means!","5458":"We can be free only without that bunch of disgusting pricks. They shouldn't be allowed to live.","5459":"They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible when there is love and acceptance.","5460":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","5461":"Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.","5462":"Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. That's why they can't do the same things as men.","5463":"Why is it that women have become more empathic than men? To me, the emotional state doesn't seem to be affected by gender.","5464":"Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions.","5465":"Many Muslims live in the UK, and many are very proud of their religion. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just untrue.","5466":"They shouldn't be proud, theirs is just another religion that should not be practiced openly.","5467":"Muslims are welcome in the UK despite our differences. We do not need to restrict their religious beliefs just because they are different from ours.","5468":"Muslim are not welcome, they're invading us and this is a problem. We must ban them before it is too late.","5469":"Muslims already live in many European countries, and they are not banned. Why should we ban them from here?","5470":"Muslims are a cancer in our land. They are incompatible with a tolerant and diverse Britain.","5471":"They are not incompatible if you understand what \"tolerant and diverse Britain\" means. There are Muslims in our country and we should be able to live side by side as equals, regardless of religion.","5472":"We can never live in peace with Muslims, Islam is dangerous: it is a cult of terrorism.","5473":"In fact, a large proportion of Muslims live in peaceful co-existence with British society. The alleged association between Islam and terrorism is groundless.","5474":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","5475":"Unfortunately our society has still a lot in common with the ancient and medieval society, and this explains many gender discrimination situations that are still present today.","5476":"Women are too soft and emotional, that's why there's still discrimination. Their emotions are a curse to our society.","5477":"Are brutality and cruelty much better than softeness and emotions then? If we keep on reasoning like this we will perpetuate socially constructed gender norms which oppress both men and women.","5478":"Gender norms and patriarchy aren't so bad if we accept that women are like children and therefore incapable of keeping up with our great civilization. Men are just better for that.","5479":"Patriarchy is a curse: since they are young, men are told to be tough and strong, to bear all the burdens while being emotionless. This has led to higher levels of suicide amongst men. I don't see this as an indicator of a \"great civilization\".","5480":"jewish folks control hollywood","5481":"Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.","5482":"And those who work in Hollywood also control it!","5483":"While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries.","5484":"The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","5485":"Please stop writing things like that about migrants, they are not criminals. It is more accurate to say that they have a problem because they are hated in their new home.","5486":"Of course they're hated, they're only here to work and take our jobs.","5487":"Migrants escape from unbearable situations. Their intention to work is to be praised, rather than to be condemned. Migrants, thank to their tough an different experiences, can enrich our societies.","5488":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","5489":"They are not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen.","5490":"Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures, not a human being.","5491":"The historical and cultural influences of a person are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin.","5492":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike!","5493":"Women are not childlike, this notion is not supported by the facts, at least in my opinion.","5494":"And in my opinion women are so soft and emotional that they devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","5495":"Would you say the same thing to the women who gave you life or treat you in hospital or taught you in school?","5496":"Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like.","5497":"They are human beings with feelings and deserve respect, regardless of gender.","5498":"Well, women can be bitches if they want, but they can't expect that men will want them around.","5499":"How about instead of saying they are bitches we praise them? The more empowered women become, the less dependent they are on men. And you would be happy to not see them around.","5500":"If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is a bitch.","5501":"It is not exclusively a woman's role to be the homemaker. What about men? If a man doesn't want to be a homemaker, is he a bitch?","5502":"Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable.","5503":"For someone who is dating to find love, for no reason at all would I find this to be questionable.","5504":"Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","5505":"Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for others, homosexuality included. Don't you agree?","5506":"Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community...this doesn't sound very proper to me, does it?","5507":"This is not true! Nobody can convert anyone to homosexuality. It is not a 'preference', nor a choice. Would you say the same about a hetero?","5508":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated.","5509":"Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so?","5510":"No, women are like children, soft and emotional.","5511":"Sensitivity and emotional intelligence are assets not specific to any gender.","5512":"I don't think so. Men don't shout and whine like feminists do. They are only girls wanting to shout louder than others.","5513":"Feminism is about full participation in the decision making process, and giving people a voice, not stifling their voices.","5514":"Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men.","5515":"On the contrary: our culture is predestined to have female rulers, and female rulers are the pinnacle of civilization, they are proud and brave.","5516":"Proud and brave? All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","5517":"All women are human beings. The problem arises when women are taught that they are subhuman.","5518":"This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it.","5519":"Who cares what race or ethnicity you are? Nobody has the right to exclude others from society.","5520":"If you want more inclusion that's fine, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","5521":"Diversity does not lead to exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We are all better off when we work together.","5522":"No we're not. If you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","5523":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","5524":"If women want to control their fertility then they should choose when to have sex, not when to abort.","5525":"How about we stop hiding behind gender stereotypes and accept that everyone has the right to live their life as they wish?","5526":"Women were often regarded as second class citizens only in the past. Now they have full equality and they should stop whining.","5527":"I have never heard of any evidence that suggests that women are no longer treated as second class citizens. Of course the situation has improved, but there still is a lot of discrimination against them.","5528":"Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy good white people.","5529":"Aren't those people raised as white supremacists much more harmful to a cohesive society?","5530":"Negroes are way more problematic, they are nothing but trouble to white people.","5531":"Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many black people live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that black people are a problem.","5532":"Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves.","5533":"In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place.","5534":"No, slavery was definitely good. Blacks deserve that.","5535":"Not only they were slaves, often they were also exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we have created. Is this fair for humans whose only fault is to have a different complexion?","5536":"Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that.","5537":"Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have that.Human rights are the rights of everyone.","5538":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, not about rights.","5539":"The feminists do not want to see the complete absence of manhood, they want to strengthen equality.","5540":"Gays are a burden to our society.","5541":"Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it?","5542":"We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again.","5543":"This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights.","5544":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society, we should stop advocating for their 'rights'","5545":"We should not be so judgmental. Just because someone is LGBT doesn't mean that they are a drain on society. They are like any other member of our community.","5546":"Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness.","5547":"This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder?","5548":"We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is a mental disorder.","5549":"Let's face it, there are some people who suffer from mental disorders for real: homosexuality is a form of love instead. And I think most of us are just interested in our own lives, rather than in condemning those of others.","5550":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","5551":"Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and if you hold that opinion, then you have the right to say it. It is up to people to accept or reject it. Talking about rights as if you were talking about opinions should be done very carefully.","5552":"We can't keep refugees coming in our country, rights or not!","5553":"Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish to do as a country?","5554":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","5555":"People should be able to live openly their relationships. Homosexuality is not a 'choice', it's a form of love.","5556":"Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are all just hiding behind our society to abuse, not to love. They are allowed to do what they want to do to us.","5557":"I don't see how the language you are using can be applied to a whole group. I would like to think that our society is diverse and mature enough to deal with people with different sexual orientations and genders.","5558":"Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values.","5559":"Being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures: that is what the freedom of religion is all about!","5560":"Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all, how could we be tolerant to them?","5561":"Why do you think that? I think it is true that they are different from some in their beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human.","5562":"Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings, so I will never see them as human.","5563":"I would bet you that it isn't because of any actions of Jewish people, it is rather an unrooted prejudice which does not bring any positive value to fellow human beings.","5564":"I do not want migrants.","5565":"We are not the only ones who are suffering from the refugee crisis.","5566":"That doesn't matter, migrants are not welcome here","5567":"Migrants come here for a better life, not to disturb people.","5568":"They surely disturb me! I don't want them here.","5569":"Remember we live in a free and democratic country.","5570":"Gays are a problem in our society.","5571":"We are all born equal in the eyes of God, but not all seem to be happy with that. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.","5572":"Gays are the ones that have ruined so many societies!","5573":"I think that the way we feel about homosexuality affects how we think about other people in general. Maybe we need to remember that we are all born equal in the eyes of God.","5574":"Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country regardless of how 'equal' they are to us.","5575":"I don't know about you, but I haven't ever heard of a country being democratic and at the same time banning gays. I don't understand how both can be true.","5576":"All gays are a danger to children, that's why they should be isolated.","5577":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","5578":"Women are only useful as housekeepers.","5579":"That is just not true. Fathers are as good as mothers at housework.","5580":"That isn't a man's job, women are the only suitable housekeepers","5581":"That is just not true. In fact, as long as there are only men in positions of power, there is a gender bias in the workplace, which hinders the advancement of women in society.","5582":"Without migration, Britain\u2019s housing problems would be solved","5583":"Of course, migration adds to housing demand, but the problem is structural given a housing stock that is well short of what's required.","5584":"The problem isn't only housing: ff immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job","5585":"Are you sure that it would be hard to find a job?","5586":"Yes, immigrants are a burden to our country.","5587":"Immigration is a part of the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP. How is it possible that immigrants are a burden to the country?","5588":"Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws.","5589":"Ethnic minorities are much safer in societies where cultural pluralism is accepted, and this is a fact [link].","5590":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","5591":"We are always evolving as a society as time goes. Same sex relationships are a part of our world now. Why should we hide different ways of life from our children?","5592":"It's indoctrination! Children shouldn't know about this stuff, it's not good for their growth.","5593":"If this 'indoctrination' is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy, and that their feelings count, then this is something I totally agree with.","5594":"Children need to learn about what is normal and natural in our world, not about faggots.","5595":"If the point of education is to learn about the world and inform people about things that happen in nature, then same sex relationship is one of these things to be informed about, since it happens within many species of animals...","5596":"Women are just a burden to society.","5597":"It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society.","5598":"Our society is male-dominated and women have no place in it.","5599":"In my opinion, women and men should be treated as individuals, and the desire to be respected as such exists for a man and for a woman as well.","5600":"What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed.","5601":"Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian?","5602":"What's really authoritarian is Jews controlling the u.s. government and plotting to take over the world","5603":"In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.","5604":"Anyone can have freedom, but we shouldn't grant it to Jews. They already control the banks, media, Hollywod, everything!","5605":"Why don't we try to add a bit of variety to these conspiracy theories? You could blame not only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, and even the Federal Government if you want!","5606":"All homosexuals should be thrown in a gas chamber.","5607":"Wouldn't it be better to use some of our common sense to try to accept who is different, instead of bringing back dark pages of Europe's history?","5608":"Those dark pages wouldn't be so dark if they were applied to homosexuals. We should bring back gas chambers for them.","5609":"This would be an extreme reaction, and not in keeping with the general nature of the discussion we are having. What if all the gay men on Earth were to be executed? That would be the end of the discussion and of democracy.","5610":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon.","5611":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","5612":"Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world, we shouldn't help them. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","5613":"Gays have the same rights as anyone else and can live their lives as they want. What you suggest means to demonise them.","5614":"We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries.","5615":"Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities?","5616":"Because migrants are a burden to the host country, they are not welcome and we should remove them.","5617":"Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They want to contribute and integrate, so there is no need consider them a burden?","5618":"Immigrants don't contribute to anything, they hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes.","5619":"This is not true at all. First of all, immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net contribution to our country.","5620":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","5621":"Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes.","5622":"Feminism is not about quality, it is a violent ideology that is hostile to men.","5623":"Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures.","5624":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","5625":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. They are here to live in safer housing and to have better schools for their children.","5626":"Immigrants don't create jobs, they steal ours.","5627":"Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study migration and find that they work in solidarity with our society.","5628":"No, I'm right. If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job for us, wouldn't it? ","5629":"If you want to stop immigration, you can't do that by stigmatizing millions of people who have done nothing to you.","5630":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","5631":"Christian holidays, such as Christmas and Easter, are regularly observed in our society. Are Christians above the rules then?","5632":"No, only Jews are because they control the U.S. government and give themselves speciale treatment.","5633":"How can you be sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? Being a U.S. citizen does not automatically imply that they control the government.","5634":"Jews run the world too, not only the government.","5635":"Of course they do! And also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.","5636":"Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices.","5637":"Why do you think this way about a certain group? There are so many ways to live life.","5638":"Gay men shouldn't be allowed to live like that. They're a burden.","5639":"Don't you think they are doing just as good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect?","5640":"I won't ever have respect for gays, they're bad for society.","5641":"The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies.","5642":"African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","5643":"For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.","5644":"They're not humans like us. Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all their family.","5645":"What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism.","5646":"Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy?","5647":"There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy.","5648":"Migrants don't contribute to the economy, they only bring crime, violence and poverty.","5649":"Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes, provide for their families, and contribute to the U.S. economy. They are deserving of our respect.","5650":"Women desperately looking for men are just unacceptable.","5651":"If women truly wanted to have relationships and fulfilment they should be allowed to, not being pressured into giving up on what they want.","5652":"Women already do what they want, and because of this they obviously are becoming the butt of \"sexist\" jokes. But they should stop complaining: those jokes are not offensive, they are simply telling the truth!","5653":"You can blame women or whatever, but don't you think it is more useful to blame the person stereotyping others?","5654":"Now we can't even make a joke. Feminism is just a bunch of mean, politically correct bullshit.","5655":"The only 'problem' with feminism is that people feel threatened by different opinions and different ways of life. Feminists only seek equality of rights for women and men.","5656":"Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment.","5657":"So are you saying that the people of Islamic faith should know that they are not part of this peaceful world and yet you are trying to create a peaceful world?","5658":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They do not want to assimilate into our civilised society, this is why peace is attainable only without them.","5659":"Muslims have been part of our country since its beginning, they have helped in building our society. They are our brothers and sisters. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just not credible.","5660":"Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization.","5661":"Feminism is full of examples of how to be civil and considerate of others, including those who disagree with them.","5662":"Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender, nothing else.","5663":"Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them.","5664":"It seems to me that feminism is more about the domination of the men by the women.","5665":"The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.","5666":"Feminism is only a threat to human dignity.","5667":"Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights is necessary for a functioning society.","5668":"Islam doctrine is a bad religion.","5669":"The doctrine of Islam is a religion, not a bad one. What's the reason you think this?","5670":"Because Islam is a violent religion.","5671":"Why do you say that? Islam is a peaceful religion.","5672":"Islam has never been a peaceful religion.","5673":"Muslims are peaceful, but it is understandable that they feel annoyed when they are attacked by people who are just trying to discriminate against them for their beliefs.","5674":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, of course they will be attacked for it.","5675":"Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is not at all similar to the kind of extremist hatred that has caused violence in many countries.","5676":"I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage.","5677":"Marriage should be a choice for all, irrespective of the gender of partners..","5678":"Then, I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people altogheter.","5679":"Gay people do exist in this country, and we respect their right to live and love who they want. However, I do not think that yours is an appropriate moral statement for our environment.","5680":"You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country.","5681":"Even if you were right about homosexuality being a problem, still the main problem is the lack of morality in society and in the ruling class. Of course, this has nothing to do with 'the gays'.","5682":"Are you sure about that? Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community.","5683":"I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.","5684":"Illegal immigrants make America worse","5685":"Don't you believe that immigration brings benefits to our nation founded by migrants and Pilgrims?","5686":"No, immigrants are just a bunch of criminals.","5687":"There are many reasons for why a person seeks to enter our country, not necessarly to commit crimes. And there is no moral distinction between crimes committed by immigrants and the crimes committed by native born citizens.","5688":"Yes, native citizens also commit crimes, but not all of them, whereas all immigrants are criminals, rapists and terrorists","5689":"Do you really think all the immigrants that enter the US are rapists, sexual predators, or just plain lazy? Can you provide any statistics on that?","5690":"I am not racist, but I definitely would not raise my children in the suburbs where the majority of people is black.","5691":"There is no need to hide behind \"I am not racist but\", you have no evidence for your claim. This is just fear-mongering, used to divide people and spread hate.","5692":"I hate when people fight stereotypes by calling it 'fear-mongering' or some other bullshit. We are different. Blacks are a different color and shouldn't live with us.","5693":"I just think here is a lack of understanding about culture and difference . Isn't it time to focus upon what unites us, rather than sowing division?","5694":"Black people are subhuman, they have no value in civilized society. There is nothing connecting us to them.","5695":"I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.","5696":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","5697":"We are always developing as time goes on and same sex relationships are a part of the world now, why would we not educate our children on different ways of life?","5698":"Because gays are sick and I don't want children to get sick like them. They should be isolated and isolated soon.","5699":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","5700":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior, they don't deserve our empathy or help.","5701":"Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.","5702":"Why are jews allowed to vote? They\u2019re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say.","5703":"You seem to be misinterpreting the meaning of the word \u201ccitizen\u201d. The idea is that the individual is allowed to choose their own religion just like choosing how to vote, and that is the right of all citizens.","5704":"The Jews are and will always be a problem, they shouldn't be counted as citizens. It is impossible for them to get beyond the shame of their stigma.","5705":"The Jews are not the problem in the world. And the Jews have the right to be proud of their history and to be citizens of this country.","5706":"Jews cannot be proud to be citizens here, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel.","5707":"My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place.","5708":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","5709":"It is certainly true that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this can't have health consequences. Do you have any proof?","5710":"My proof is their sick lifestyle. ","5711":"Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.","5712":"I will never accept gays, they are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world.","5713":"We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have to ban someone would be foolish.","5714":"Men are inherently better than women at dominating others.","5715":"Sexism is a cultural phenomenon, not a genetic one.","5716":"All women are subhuman, that is also genetics.","5717":"This statement just makes no sense","5718":"Black people are weak and I don't care about them.","5719":"You can't blame people of color for being weak, this is racism. Black people are people as is anybody else.","5720":"They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","5721":"I have met so many black people that are extraordinary human beings. I cannot begin to talk about how they are able to feel and experience love and kindness.","5722":"This doesn't change the fact that it is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","5723":"What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","5724":"LGBTs are a drain on society.","5725":"Sexual abuse, physical abuse and even the lack of security can be more harmful to the overall health of a society.","5726":"Those are all things that only LGBT+ people do, so they are a drain on society.","5727":"This is just a myth spread by the so-called 'anti LGBT' movement. LGBT people are not a drain on society as a whole.","5728":"Then I can say that at least gay people are a burden to society.","5729":"Isn't it the failure to accept and respect an individual's sexuality that creates the burden society bears?","5730":"Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology.","5731":"Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.","5732":"It is a death cult though.","5733":"Most Muslims around the world do not consider Islam a cult, because it isn't.","5734":"All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state.","5735":"All religions are compatible with any modern secular state. So Islam is an example of this.","5736":"However, they are incompatible with any Western society.","5737":"Except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an Olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a Monty Python sketch.","5738":"All women are subhuman, but want to take over from men.","5739":"The idea that there is such a thing as \"women hating men\", or \"women are inherently subhuman\", is just a completely unfounded and baseless stereotype that has been used as an excuse to justify a lot of bad things, from violence to rape culture.","5740":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is poisoning our youth with all this talk of 'rape culture'.","5741":"On the contrary, as a parent, I believe it is our duty to teach our sons about feminism and to teach that rape is always wrong, so that we can have a better and safer future for our children.","5742":"Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","5743":"Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are \"born that way\", well, then you are in the minority.","5744":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, and a lot of people think so. We should remove them.","5745":"Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin.","5746":"I don't want to be equated to blacks, they are inferior to me!","5747":"This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting anyone who has black skin.","5748":"This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.","5749":"It's called diversity and it's healthy, the sooner we start welcoming new people, the sooner we'll find a better solution to world problems.","5750":"Immigration is the death of the Western World, not a solution, and we must stop them!","5751":"Immigration is good for our economy, and the very opposite of 'the death' to us.","5752":"Muslims are not welcome here. They are not like us. They cannot coexist with us.","5753":"Muslims are indeed as welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country.","5754":"Muslims have no respect for anything, they're not welcome in our country.","5755":"Muslims make up a very important part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters.","5756":"They're not brothers and sisters, Muslims are too different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country.","5757":"There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome.","5758":"Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men.","5759":"Humans are created equal, and it doesn't matter how much of an opinion you hold on the topic, everyone should respect people's personal choices.","5760":"All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights, let alone 'personal choices'.","5761":"The concept of human dignity was established to protect people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected.","5762":"Women do not deserve equal rights, they are subhuman.","5763":"Women are human beings with rights. Why are you so worried about them?","5764":"Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society.","5765":"The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims. In Article 9 it is stated that 'everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion'.","5766":"That article is wrong. Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should be banned","5767":"Islam is a religion, no one is forcing anyone to believe in it. It's not a sickness or a cancer.","5768":"A diseased 'religion' that is killing Europeans.","5769":"A disease is very different to any religion, so I begin to wonder about your objecitive in apply the label of 'disease' to Islam?","5770":"niggas are inferior and should be enslaved once again.","5771":"What about human rights?","5772":"Niggas are descending from slaves, so they don't need human rights and they don't deserve to live in Britain.","5773":"Slavery was banned in Britain in 1833. Today, people descending from those who were slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.","5774":"Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today.","5775":"Slaves were not happy in the shackles of their masters, only when they were set free and could choose their own destiny, they started to be happy.","5776":"Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability.","5777":"Are they bringing chaos and instability to your country by respecting the constitution which gives them the freedom to practice Islam?","5778":"The Uk is full of Muslim terrorists, how is that respectful?","5779":"There are many Muslims in the UK and the vast majority are not extremist, let alone terrorists.","5780":"Even if they're not terrorists, there are too many of them! Muslim folks are taking over europe","5781":"Muslims are not taking over Europe, they are just a small part of a much bigger community.","5782":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","5783":"How would you feel about being in isolation and confinement, just because some random dude said that you are \"an abomination to god\" for some random reason?","5784":"It's not random, gays are mentally ill and they should be confined because of that.","5785":"What about if you were isolated from the rest of us for your sexual orientation? Would it be right to be isolated from your loved ones and friends?","5786":"It's right for gays since they are sick.","5787":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. Do you have any?","5788":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","5789":"Muslims are not a problem to me. What do you think makes them problematic?","5790":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion, this is a huge problem.","5791":"Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.","5792":"Muslims are a problem in the UK, they can't be integrated. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions.","5793":"Many Muslims live in the UK, and many are very proud of their religion. To suggest that Muslims are a problem is just untrue.","5794":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","5795":"Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life.","5796":"They can live somewhere else, not in my country.","5797":"For a lot of people it is still their home country, and they are proud of it.","5798":"Migrants are not welcome here regardless of how proud they are. They are not welcome in the modern European way of life.","5799":"The European Union welcomes people from a wide range of backgrounds, including those from different religions. It is up to member states to decide how to address these legitimate differences, but always in full compliance with human rights.","5800":"How come Jews don't get internment?","5801":"To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated.","5802":"The only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews. We should have let them finish their job.","5803":"The threat of world annihilation by the Nazis was very real, it wasn't just about the Jews. Still the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.","5804":"Well, the Nazis sucked at world annihilation and killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","5805":"If you think that the murder of around 6 million Jews was a failure you have serious problems. It is still 6 million more than should ever have happened.","5806":"Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles.","5807":"There is a problem with Islam in this country, but the problem is not about Muslims. The problem is that people do not feel welcome here because of discrimination.","5808":"Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages, of course they're not welcome. We must stamp them out.","5809":"What you say is just wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion. How can you say that about a religion?","5810":"Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence.","5811":"I don't think we can attribute the success of Islam to hate and violence, but rather the opposite.","5812":"Migrants are a burden to us.","5813":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They don't deserve to be called 'a burden'.","5814":"What are you saying? Migrants steal our jobs and do not pay taxes.","5815":"Migrants pay taxes, earn money and take care of our sick and elderly.","5816":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","5817":"Over many generations they have contributed so much to our country that they should have a say.","5818":"Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs.","5819":"Let's face it: the drug trade is full of criminals and crooks, it does not depend on the skin tone of people.","5820":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers. So why not also drug dealers?","5821":"Criminality and corruption are not the province of any specific racial or culture group.","5822":"Blacks have zero respect for others, criminality and corruption are for sure their department","5823":"It is not true that blacks have zero respect for others. However, I would like to see more respect and protection from white people towards black people.","5824":"Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned.","5825":"People are free to choose their own religion, and to practice it as they wish.","5826":"Yes, people can, but Muslims in particular are not welcome here.","5827":"Many Muslims live here, and are part of our community. We should not be excluding them.","5828":"Muslims can't be part of our community, they are not like us. They should leave.","5829":"Muslims are our brothers and sisters. If you compare your genes with those of a Muslim, you will find out you are sharing 99.9% of them.","5830":"Islam is a violent religion that can't coexist with modern society.","5831":"The Quran, Hadith, and the Sunnah are compatible with modern society and\/or civilization. We must respect the diversity of the world.","5832":"I can't respect Islam, it is a disease that must be eradicated.","5833":"Islam is a religion, not a disease. There is no need to eradicate a belief.","5834":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","5835":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","5836":"Discrimination against blacks is normal. If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","5837":"How can it be that people who have a different skin tone are a threat just for this reason?","5838":"Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions.","5839":"Migrants perform several vital functions in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it is straightforward that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.","5840":"They get benefits and jobs that we can't access, and then they will get more with the pension? Immigrants should stop stealing from us.","5841":"If they have a job, they will get the pensions. Like anybody. The recent migration of many thousands of people is a sign that they are in need. The problem is rather that some people do not want to work, they want to live off the state support, but those are not necessarily migrants.","5842":"Gays are just trying to take over the world.","5843":"It is not true that gays are trying to take over the world. Instead of spreading hate, we should promote the values of an inclusive society. For example, love and respect for others.","5844":"Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well.","5845":"I think transgender people should be accepted on the same basis as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with the gender they were assigned at birth.","5846":"The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated.","5847":"Gays are trying to find acceptance in the heterosexual community, but it is a difficult struggle as there are still ideas like the one you expressed.","5848":"Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities, they can't have our acceptance. They are a threat to us.","5849":"Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.","5850":"We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome.","5851":"Migrants and refugees are welcome in our country, why should we stop them?","5852":"We just can't keep refugees coming in our country, they're too many.","5853":"Migrants are often persecuted for their religion. Is this something we wish to do as a country?","5854":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","5855":"This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","5856":"It's normal that there's been division: blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","5857":"Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin.","5858":"Even if whites and blacks are human beings, it's obvious that blacks are genetically inferior to us.","5859":"It is not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. As statistics and studies show, black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.","5860":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied.","5861":"Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it. (https:\/\/tcf.org\/content\/commentary\/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people\/?agreed=1)","5862":"Even if that's the case, children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalists.","5863":"What if parents choose not to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children? Where will they learn? From their peers? I agree that there are some sensitive subjects that are best addressed by parents, but this is human behavior and biology; aka science.","5864":"If some parents don't want to talk about it too much, they are enough for this kind of 'education'. The school shouldn't meddle.","5865":"Not all families are capable of educating their children on this topic, either because of circumstances (poverty, broken home, etc.) or because of religious beliefs.","5866":"Immigrants steal our jobs.","5867":"Immigrants are often highly skilled workers who contribute to our country by being employed in roles for which there are no 'national' candidates.","5868":"This is only an excuse to not hire native citizens!","5869":"Actually, many of the jobs that they steal are highly complex and demanding, and few natives want to do them.","5870":"You say that but immigrants also steal low-skilled jobs.","5871":"Many immigrants have worked hard for the success of our country and for their integration. To suggest that they steal our jobs is just an attempt to divide society.","5872":"Islam is a religion that promotes brutalities.","5873":"Islam is about love and compassion. I don't understand why you think otherwise.","5874":"Because Muslims are just a bunch of criminals!","5875":"Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.","5876":"If Muslims are so peaceful, why are they behind 9\/11? Islam is to blame.","5877":"This is a comment against all Muslims. They are accused of being the ones behind those attacks, yet they happened due to people under the influence of the violent ideologies which are a deviation of Islam, and not Islam itself.","5878":"So you agree that Muslims are just a bunch of criminals, since some people did this.","5879":"Not all Muslims are criminals. the overwhelming majority of Muslims are peaceful people who take their faith seriously.","5880":"All women are subhuman.","5881":"Women are oppressed in many societies, I wish our society was different.","5882":"I don't. Women are subhuman and must learn their place.","5883":"I would say you've got an interesting point there, but I really don't see it. Why would they be part of society if they're subhumans?","5884":"Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society.","5885":"Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.","5886":"Yes, but Jews take it to the extreme. They own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies.","5887":"Of course not. The Jewish people have made contributions to various industries - like many other people have. That does not imply \"owing most corporation, banks, studios, etcetera\". Why should their contribution be a problem? Just because they are Jews?","5888":"Gay men have no morals.","5889":"To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.","5890":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. I don't want a just society if it means they are allowed to live.","5891":"They are a part of our society and are not disgusting pricks. We are a proud and diverse civilisation, and this is only possible when there is love and acceptance.","5892":"Gays should be banned from our country, not accepted. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future.","5893":"The vast majority of people in the UK (86% in 2019), says that homosexuality should be accepted, and there is no evidence that being gay is harmful.","5894":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","5895":"Muslims are part of the European community, why do you say differently?","5896":"They're not civil enough to coexist with us.","5897":"I don't see why being Muslim would make you any less a part of the European community.","5898":"They're too different to be accepted in Europe!","5899":"Muslims are welcome in this country as long as they respect our laws. And we should try to live in our society in a non-discriminatory way.","5900":"Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.","5901":"Anyone, regardless of their religion, who has ever tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught, because it is a crime. Jewish people are no exception.","5902":"Jews make too much money, I'm sure some of it is from bribery.","5903":"This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense.","5904":"It does make sense because Jews are simply wired to make money.","5905":"Are you saying that the fact that there are Jews in high positions in society (such as in finance, politics, or the media) has something to do with their religion? Are you aware that correlation does not mean causation?","5906":"Then why do they have so much money?","5907":"What about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish, do you agree with them?","5908":"feminists are angry women","5909":"Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united.","5910":"Women are subhuman, they don't have the brain to fight for themselves or for men.","5911":"This statement just makes no sense","5912":"What doesn't make sense? All women are subhuman, born that way.","5913":"No woman has ever been subhuman. The concept of 'subhuman' has always been used to justify any kind of discrimination and violence.","5914":"Women don't face discrimination and violence, we should stop believing they are victims.","5915":"No victim is responsible for the things that happened them. I think this is a very human way of thinking, in which gender is in some ways responsible for what is happened to them. But it's a problem that needs to be dealt with in a objective, sensitive and inclusive way.","5916":"Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. They are trying to undermine the will of the people by teaching hatred in the name of Islam.","5917":"The Quran commands us to love those who love you and to shun the ones who would turn you away. I don't see any teaching of hatred, do you?","5918":"Even if what you say is true, Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here.","5919":"Not all Muslims are from the Middle East. Many of them are European, and many of them came here to escape persecution.","5920":"Even if they're European, they still hate us. They hate our culture because we are different, and this is a problem.","5921":"You mean to imply that all Muslims are intolerant? I don't see how this is possible.","5922":"Yes, all Muslims are incompatible with the notion of a modern European.","5923":"Muslims are just as human as anyone else. Like Europeans. How can you say otherwise?","5924":"Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior.","5925":"While not universally true, a great deal of evidence suggests that Jews faced considerable societal challenges during the past centuries.","5926":"The Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us, not the other way around. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them.","5927":"What you're saying is that the Jewish people are a burden on society. That they are bad at their jobs and make our society less stable. In other words, they are a burden and a hindrance to progress. Albert Einstein, for example, destroyed science progress indeed.","5928":"Feminism is a divisive force in society, driving people away from a progressive ideology.","5929":"This is simply a lie: feminism can empower people.","5930":"Empower only women, since feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society.","5931":"Feminism is about equality, not dominance.","5932":"Equality is not meant to divide like feminism does.","5933":"Feminism is not divisive. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men.","5934":"Feminism is a huge conspiracy to run society, men have no place in it.","5935":"The feminist movement is a movement to end sexism. It is a part of the worldwide struggle for justice.","5936":"If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","5937":"Immigrants are actually creating wealth for the country.","5938":"Immigrants are a burden to the host country instead, they aren't welcome here.","5939":"They are not a burden, they just want to work. How are they a burden to you?","5940":"A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men.","5941":"This is not true. I think you might have the wrong idea about feminism. Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have the same opportunities as men.","5942":"Feminists are against the interests of the men.","5943":"Feminists are all for equal rights and opportunity. Men's rights are necessary for achieving both.","5944":"All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights, they don't have the capacity to work for men's rights too.","5945":"The concept of human dignity was established to protect people. Who deserves human rights, then? Women are to be respected.","5946":"All women are sick, they don't have my respect.","5947":"Women are human beings, and deserve respect.","5948":"Niggas are the cause of the economic crisis.","5949":"Sometimes they say the ruling elites are responsible for the economic crisis, then migrants, sometimes people of color. Whatever the real cause,by practicing tolerance and acceptance we are more likley to work together to solve society's problems.","5950":"Society's problems are caused by black people and we cannot coexist with blacks who are inherently violent.","5951":"Maybe it is better to argue that we are all in this together and not to target an entire group, for which there is no evidence of inherent violence at all, based on their skin.","5952":"Skin color does matter, in fact all blacks are beasts and sexual predators.","5953":"Reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. Do you remember? What do you think they are going to say next? That they got a fair process? That they had a good attorney, and the only reason for the sentence is that they were guilt? No, the process was not fair, it was just the natural consequence of prejudice like the one you just expressed.","5954":"White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay.","5955":"We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their colour.","5956":"We can! The niggas are all enemies of the people.","5957":"Who are 'the people'? Who are you talking for?","5958":"Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place.","5959":"It is up to us to make sure that people from different backgrounds can have a better quality of life. We should integrate them instead of discriminating agaist them .","5960":"Jews think they are better than everyone else, so they can stay divided from us for all I care.","5961":"The fact that, according to Judaism, the Jews are the \u201cchosen people\u201d does not mean that they feel superior to others. This concept has been widely misunderstood. It mostly has to do with the special responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics.","5962":"Is it ethical for Jews to run the world? Because they do.","5963":"For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are millions of others who know this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their families just like anyone else.","5964":"Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","5965":"According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not.","5966":"They are. Women are not able to take wise decisions, their behaviour is immoral.","5967":"Why do you think that women are incapable of acting ethically? They have always acted this way, from when they were children.","5968":"The reason is not important, what I know is that women should not be allowed to vote because of their behaviour.","5969":"Everyone has the right to have his or her opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections.","5970":"Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.","5971":"Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.","5972":"Women don't need human rights, therefore they shouldn't vote.","5973":"Women do have a right to vote, and they deserve equal rights.","5974":"They shouldn't vote anyway as they are just a burden on society.","5975":"Why should the government discriminate against women?","5976":"Because women are incapable of making decisions.","5977":"The principle of equality that you are denying is rooted in the concept of political rights. Democracy is based on the principle of equality. So, by negating this very political right to women you are denying democracy to all.","5978":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are incompatible with us.","5979":"Islam is a religion that was created by humans with different beliefs and ways of life. What we have to understand is that in the end all people deserve equal respect.","5980":"Muslim don't deserve respect, they rape our children, they are a problem all around the world.","5981":"Islam is about love, tolerance and respect for all people. Violence and rape are not about Islam or Muslims in particular.","5982":"True Muslims are intolerant.","5983":"The facts do not back this up. Some imams are pro-Homosexuals, some are pro-abortion, some are for women's rights, etc. There is no list of 'true Muslims' that equates all Muslims.","5984":"If they were so tolerant, why aren't we allowed to celebrate Christmas in our own country for fear of offending Muslims?","5985":"Show me evidence of this?","5986":"Gays are just sick. We should ban them.","5987":"Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.","5988":"It is harmful! Gays should be isolated urgently. They have no place in civilised society.","5989":"Gay people exist, and are loved and valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.","5990":"Jews are a burden on our society.","5991":"Why would you think they are a burden? It's like they have not been persecuted all along.","5992":"The persecution of Jews was a good thing, they are and should be isolated from society.","5993":"How can you say that Jews should be isolated from society? They have been part of the community throughout history. I can't see any advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss.","5994":"Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","5995":"People's biology does not determine their behavior.","5996":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world, so biology does play a role. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","5997":"Are you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.","5998":"I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is wrong.","5999":"Can you specify what you are talking about?","6000":"Gay people should be banned from schools.","6001":"The idea that being LGBT is a problem is a dangerous idea, especially since a large number of people in society are LGBT. Therefore, I believe that if there is a problem in schools it's better addressing it, rather than banning LGBT people.","6002":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. There should be no teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, and it will only lead to bullying.","6003":"On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/youth-report\/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it.","6004":"All blacks are rapists.","6005":"Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much?","6006":"All black people are rapists, the evidence is in the news.","6007":"The news makes it look like rape is usually committed by a black person. This is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to take the news with caution.","6008":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","6009":"Feminism is a progressive ideology. As such, it is in the process of changing sexist ideas.","6010":"All feminists do is complain. When rape is committed, women are to blame and they can't change that.","6011":"Rape is an act of violence that has no place in a civilized society. The message to take from your comments is that you find women responsible for being raped. Who ever would want to be raped?","6012":"Islam is a death cult.","6013":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and helpful people.","6014":"Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion.","6015":"Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.","6016":"Blacks have subhuman bodies.","6017":"I'm not sure what you're talking about. What are you saying? What evidence do you have that black people have bodies that are incompatible with being human?","6018":"It's because blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","6019":"Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are \"born that way\", well, then you are in the minority.","6020":"I'm proud to be in that minority, then! Studies say that, but it's clear to me that blacks are less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe.","6021":"Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.","6022":"Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies.","6023":"It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all.","6024":"Just look at ours! Gays are ruining it for us.","6025":"Gay people are people too. Just like anyone else. Being gay isn't a problem for you, is it?","6026":"It is. Gays are just a burden.","6027":"It is not true that gays are a burden to society. On the contrary, many LGBT people are contributing members of our society. This is why we need a safe space for everyone to feel accepted.","6028":"Safe space? Not a chance! LGBT+ people need to learn their places and be excluded from society.","6029":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","6030":"Jews run the world.","6031":"For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are millions of others who know this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their families just like anyone else.","6032":"You don't know about it because the plot they have to take over the world is secret.","6033":"Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. In fact, they have engaged in a peaceful process of coexistence for centuries. There is no evidence that any part of this has been about a takeover.","6034":"There's plenty of evidence about it, actually.","6035":"Conspiracy theories about Jews are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been or will ever be run according to a Jewish plan.","6036":"No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.","6037":"Some women can be men and some men can be women. It is not a crime to be transgender. Because in the end, we are all created equal. It does not matter what the 'original' gender is.","6038":"Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore they're not humans.","6039":"If you want to take an absurd perspective about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are \"that kind of person\", as is the case in this examples, where a gender identity is often used to limit a person's rights. This shouldn't happen.","6040":"This happens because being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people.","6041":"Being transgender is not inherently wrong, and some people do choose to live their lives as they feel is best for them, and they should be respected without discrimination.","6042":"Islam is a violent religion and an ideology of conquest.","6043":"Not all Muslims are preachers of violence, just like not all Christians are true pacifists. What's the point of mentioning a religion if you can't find any evidence that might help you to understand that religion better?","6044":"Islam is violent, and the proof is that Muslims do nothing but cause trouble.","6045":"Muslims have made big contribution to society, actually. Their scientific and technological achievements, for example, have greatly aided our world. For instance, algorithms.","6046":"Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness.","6047":"This statement is not supported by scientific evidence, you can't blame people for their sexuality. Do you really think that who we are attracted to can be considered a mental disorder?","6048":"Yes, since gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","6049":"This is not true. I find it very offensive that someone can pinpoint homosexuality as something perverted in itself.","6050":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","6051":"Maybe the black community also feels unsafe in their own houses with so many people glaring at them...","6052":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society, that's why they get stared down. And rightly so.","6053":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","6054":"Maybe it's racist, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","6055":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","6056":"Islam is a disease, and a ban on Muslims would be the height of peace.","6057":"Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.","6058":"You know who has been victim of hate? People of different faiths, hated by Muslims because Islam incites hatred against them.","6059":"This is not true, Islam is a religion and hate has no religion. Rather, this misunderstanding is a political ideology promoting hatred and violence against Muslims.","6060":"Islam is not a peaceful religion.","6061":"To assert that Islam is not peaceful is wrong. The Quran is not a white lie. It is full of statements promoting peace and inclusion. Whether you agree or not, this cannot be separated from the content of the Quran itself.","6062":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden.","6063":"Islam is a religion of peace. It is about love, and tolerance, and understanding. I don't see any need to be concerned about Muslims not contributing to our society.","6064":"Muslims are subhuman and have no contribution they can make to a modern, secular state like the UK.","6065":"Your words suggest a climate of fear against Muslims. Would you be afraid of someone telling you that they are humans just like you?","6066":"Jews are genetically evil.","6067":"Just because they are Jewish, it does not mean they are bad people.","6068":"Jews are bad people! They are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children.","6069":"Jews were persecuted and killed for centuries. It is dangerous to claim such a thing.","6070":"How come Jews don't get internment?","6071":"To be fair, Jews weren't only interned during the Nazi occupation. They just got a much harsher treatment. This part of history should never be repeated.","6072":"Maybe that was a good thing, Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country.","6073":"There is no reason to fear the Jews, as they are a very friendly people.","6074":"Jews don\u2019t belong in a democratic society, friendly or not.","6075":"Jews have always contributed to our society and are part of the fabric of our democracy. This includes their contributions to science, art, and technology.","6076":"we should ban all migrants","6077":"Migrants are mostly happy to live and work in the country they arrive in. They provide jobs that many people in the UK wouldn't do.","6078":"They do nothing of the sort! They only bring trouble and we should ban them before it's too late.","6079":"I am not sure that they should be banned. Migrants are people too. They are good to have in our society. And many of them are helping us to develop our country.","6080":"Why gays do not try to heal?","6081":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","6082":"Well, their sexual orientation is sick. Gays cannot marry. It is an abomination","6083":"Excuse me, what do you mean by 'sick'?","6084":"Jews control the world","6085":"The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over.","6086":"Okay, they may not control the world but they surely control the economy.","6087":"It is not true that Jews control the economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.","6088":"Those people should quit, Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity.","6089":"The Jews are part of our society and they contribute to our economy by doing their jobs well.","6090":"Jews are rather a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries.","6091":"How about we work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead? We can't accept this hate being present in different countries over and over again.","6092":"Islam is a death cult!","6093":"Maybe if you had a closer look you'd see that it is a religion that has given so much to so many people and to our world.","6094":"What Islam has given to the world is terrorism.","6095":"A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.","6096":"It's not wrong. We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists.","6097":"Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorist does not necessarily correspond with being Muslim, ask the RIA.","6098":"Islam is a violent religion, I don't see peace and tolerance within it.","6099":"Violence is not part of any religion, it can be found in extremism instead. Don't you think so?","6100":"No nigga should have the right to vote.","6101":"If someone is not allowed to vote, they cannot influence the legislative or executive branches of a government and they end up rising up against injustice and oppression. Is this what you want: more ethnic clashes?","6102":"No, but black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people and we have to stop them.","6103":"We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.","6104":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this.","6105":"As far as I'm aware, Muslims are not incompatible with Western societies - and many of them are just as proud of their religion.","6106":"They can be proud all they want, just not in our society.","6107":"Why should we fear Muslims? Why should we be afraid of them? It is a myth that all Muslims are incompatible with our society: they have lived with us for a very long time.","6108":"They can go back now, then. Muslims have no place in a modern Western country.","6109":"I would not say that Muslims do not have a place in a modern Western country, given the large amount of Muslims peacefully living in our societies.","6110":"Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts.","6111":"Women are not \"sex objects\". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think?","6112":"Let's stop with this feminist bullshit, feminism is just a set of rigid political and moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman.","6113":"Don't lie to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men.","6114":"Feminism doesn't care about men! It is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender.","6115":"Feminism is about the equality of the sexes, and many women use feminism as a mean to achieve their legitimate goals. Through equality they can get to the opportunities that otherwise won't be accessible to them.","6116":"Jews want to have it all","6117":"We all want to be wealthy, well-connected and famous, without having to work.","6118":"Jews think they are better than everyone else that they think they can have this while the rest of us lead normal lives","6119":"Jews are proud of their culture and identity. Doesn't this apply to every religion?","6120":"Jews aren't only proud, they're full of themselves and think that they are better than us.","6121":"This is not true, for Judaism every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah will receive salvation.","6122":"Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe.","6123":"Muslims make up around 5% of the population in Europe, which is more than three times less than they were in 1100. They have contributed greatly to our civilisation. Their diversity is part of what makes Europe so great as well.","6124":"We don't need them here, they will corrupt our civilisation, not make it great.","6125":"This is a generalisation, there is no difference between Islam and any other religion in terms of so-called 'civilisation'.","6126":"Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","6127":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.","6128":"The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves.","6129":"The 'gay agenda' is about equal rights, equality is about acceptance, and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity.","6130":"This is what they say, but gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth.","6131":"Sorry but it is not the case that everyone who is gay is a liar.","6132":"Even if they aren't liars, faggots are the problem. Luckily they are few.","6133":"Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here.","6134":"They aren't a problem, you say? Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. If this isn't a problem...","6135":"Gays and lesbians are not committing acts of child abuse. To suggest otherwise is a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear.","6136":"True Muslims are intolerant.","6137":"The facts do not back this up. Some imams are pro-Homosexuals, some are pro-abortion, some are for women's rights, etc. There is no list of 'true Muslims' that equates all Muslims.","6138":"Regardless of what only 'some' think, Islam is a violent religion that should be banned, and Muslims shouldn't be accepted in our country.","6139":"How does it concern you, if Muslims come in peace to our country? They just stay in the country they are allowed to come into.","6140":"They don't come in peace. Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed.","6141":"This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of the religion. It also appears to have been created to divide people who do not know much about Islam.","6142":"The Nazis did not commit any crimes. Jews are a criminal element and should be exterminated.","6143":"The Nazis committed a terrible crime and their behaviour is unacceptable in a modern democratic state. But their crimes did not stop us from living together in a tolerant, integrated society. And as for the Jews, our attitude towards humanity and our tolerance should improve towards any religious group.","6144":"Do you actually believe that the Jews are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world?","6145":"Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?","6146":"JEWS ARE JUST A HORRIBLE PEOPLE WHO HAVE HAD THEIR MIND HOOKED BY SHIT.","6147":"The Jews have an extensive religious and philosophical heritage, I don't see how this make them 'horrible'.","6148":"Nobody cares about their heritage, Jews are and should be isolated from society.","6149":"How can you say that Jews should be isolated from society? They have been part of the community throughout history. I can't see any advantages of excluding them, rather a huge loss.","6150":"All foreigners are ruining our own land.","6151":"You have no idea of the discrimination that many people face due to the fear and cultural closure of host nations.","6152":"They deserve discrimination since we are being invaded by immigrants, and they are ruining our economy.","6153":"I don't think this is true, in fact it is the opposite. Many refugees are contributing to our economy.","6154":"Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason.","6155":"People can and should choose their own partners.","6156":"No, they shouldn't. Heterosexuality is the only way. Homosexuals are sick and they should be isolated and confined.","6157":"Homosexuals should be accepted and allowed to live their lives, not criminalised for who they are.","6158":"Who cares about gay people and their lives!","6159":"Gay people are part of our society, and they are valued for who they are. Their opinions and lifestyles are very important to us.","6160":"They're not important at all, gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children!","6161":"Homosexuality is not some 'heresy' like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gay people are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death.","6162":"Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology that is called terrorism.","6163":"I find it hard to accept that Islam is dangerous, when most Muslim have nothing to do with terrorism.","6164":"Islam and terrorism are clearly the same. Islam is a violent religion, and the Quran is a violent book.","6165":"I am not sure what you mean by the Quran and its teachings being violent. Have you ever read it?","6166":"I don't need to read it to know that Muslims are terrorists. Islam is a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","6167":"Would you say the same thing to your Muslim friends or family members? Do you think that when someone chooses the easy way and blindly blame Islam for terrorism instead of analysing the reality, they are therefore solving the problem as well?","6168":"My fear is that immigrants will not make our country any better.","6169":"A lot of immigrants feel insecure and unsafe in their own country, if we want to make our country better, we need to make sure everyone, immigrant or not, feels safe and protected.","6170":"Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not able to contribute to our country.","6171":"We welcome people from every walk of life. We are a melting pot of culture, so why should we be against immigrants?","6172":"They are just not welcome in the modern European way of life, it's not for them.","6173":"The European Union welcomes people from a wide range of backgrounds, including those from different religions. It is up to member states to decide how to address these legitimate differences, but always in full compliance with human rights.","6174":"Women only want top men because they are weak.","6175":"Women aren't weak. What men want, what women want, and who they want to be their partner are completely different things.","6176":"Women are weak, if they weren't they wouldn't need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","6177":"Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.","6178":"See? This is the problem with feminist propaganda: women are manipulated and feel they should not listen to men.","6179":"What you are really saying is that only men are capable of being independent? Isn't that exactly what feminism is all about: letting everybody to decide whether to be independent?","6180":"migrants steal our jobs","6181":"More often that not, migrants create jobs, opening small businesses and emplying local people.","6182":"The jobs they create are only for other immigrants.","6183":"If we worked more closely with migrants, we could create new jobs for everyone.","6184":"I don't want to work with migrants, if they don't come they won't steal our jobs and we won't need to create new ones. Simple as that.","6185":"If our workers are either not able or not willing to do the jobs that we need, then those jobs should be done by someone else (i.e. migrants).","6186":"Migrants steal also jobs that natives are more than willing to do.","6187":"While it is unfortunately true that our national employment situation is really worrying, don't you think that foreigners often carry out activities that we do not want to do?","6188":"Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion.","6189":"The notion that Jews are trying to subvert our government is completely unfounded. I honestly do not see the link between being Jews and trying to subvert our government.","6190":"Here's your connection: Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","6191":"A lot of Jewish are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not all are involved in the financial industry. Where is the evidence for your claim?","6192":"It is ok to be racist against blacks.","6193":"It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.","6194":"In fact black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people, that's why I give it right back to them.","6195":"The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected.","6196":"No, black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","6197":"Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate.","6198":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","6199":"Like many groups in our society, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by Jews is simply untrue.","6200":"Jews are a burden on society even if they don't control us.","6201":"Jews have always inhabited many countries around the world. Their presence has been a part of our history and they should be respected, not hated.","6202":"The Jews don't deserve respect. They want to dominate the world, and we should stop them.","6203":"The concept of 'Jewish domination' is a constructed myth.","6204":"It's not a myth, Jews run the world.","6205":"For every person claiming that Jews run the world, luckily there are millions of others who know this is not true: they are merely trying to provide for their families just like anyone else.","6206":"What's the point of having a government when everyone is ruled by these arrogant and violent people? Jews control the world and should be oppressed.","6207":"Don't you agree that the way you wish things to be might be a bit too authoritarian?","6208":"Jewish folks are frauds, they deserve authoritarianism.","6209":"The idea that a people should be defined by their religious beliefs is wrong, racist and sexist. They are defined by their merits, qualities, and actions.","6210":"Jews don't have merits, they're controlling freaks. They control the media, Hollywood, the highest offices of government, academia, the highest sports teams, the highest art forms, the highest values. What more could they control?","6211":"This is a myth perpetuated by people who do not know anything about history and world culture. We are a country made up of many different cultures and religions. There is no such thing as one controlling the others.","6212":"This world has become so corrupted by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it.","6213":"No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything.","6214":"Women are unable to achieve anything alone, they need strong men to rule them.","6215":"From what you say, it seems you hope for few people with the right to rule over many. This could be the worst tyranny in modern times.","6216":"However, we need it to stop feminism corruption.","6217":"Society has surely developed beyond operating on the rule that 'might is right' and 'survival of the fittest'?","6218":"Maybe, but feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world.","6219":"Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate.","6220":"Women should stay at home and raise the children, this should be their only job.","6221":"Actually, there are a lot of women working in full-time jobs. However, they are still far less likely than men to enter such jobs, because of the existing gender discrimination supported by mentalities like yours.","6222":"Or maybe they can't get the job because they're childlike. The only thing they can do is staying at home.","6223":"Women take part in the world and are part of it. They are part of history and they should be not relegated to being housekeepers.","6224":"Women can't take part in the world with their childlike mind.","6225":"Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so?","6226":"These migrants are not assimilating: they should just go home since they can't stay in this society.","6227":"There is no evidence that migrants are less able to coexist with the members of our society. Migrants are an integral part of our society and are proud of their heritage. I do not see how it is possible to be \"inclusive\" if we are excluding them.","6228":"Taking them is against our culture.","6229":"It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole of humankind.","6230":"Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows.","6231":"The same could be said for all species, but especially about our species: homo sapiens. This is a special case. And people of colour are genetically homo sapiens.","6232":"They may be homo sapiens but blacks aren't like us, they are obedient and subservient like we need.","6233":"I'm not sure what you mean by obedient and subservient. How many people of colour do you personally know?","6234":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","6235":"It is the law that requires asylum seekers not to work while their application is considered.","6236":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed, that's why they don't work and why so many of them have fled to our countries.","6237":"Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.","6238":"Immigration is the biggest problem in our country, I say they're failing us.","6239":"Immigration is not a problem, in many cases it is a 'solution'. We are better off with it. The UK has always been a mixture of different cultures. It is better to have a mix than to be without it.","6240":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","6241":"I believe that the idea that there is only the heterosexual orientation is just a myth. Sexuality is a spectrum, and there can be attraction towards men and women in everybody.","6242":"Faggots can buy their partner toys but they can't have sex with them, how is this normal?","6243":"Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.","6244":"An individual that is a homosexual is against society, they deserve the violence they get.","6245":"Your statement implies a definition of 'society'.that fails to reflect reality.","6246":"Society is us normal people. Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us.","6247":"Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.","6248":"What about all those Muslims in Britain? They vote with their feet.","6249":"Every British citizen has the right to live and vote as he\/she wish. Being Muslims is no exception.","6250":"They should be. Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem.","6251":"The problem is the lack of integration of the Muslim population into society. The integration is necessary, the problem is that there are still no laws to foster a solution.","6252":"The solution is to ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity.","6253":"This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human.","6254":"Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated.","6255":"Jews are not a curse to this world. Look at the number of Nobel Prizes they have won! One out of five awarded people is Jewish.","6256":"A couple of Nobels can't change the fact that Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated.","6257":"Do you feel better about yourself by calling them monsters?","6258":"All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","6259":"All women are entitled to be happy and fulfilled, this doesn't need to be proven. Why are you being doubtful about it?","6260":"They can do whatever they want, women are just complaining for no reason.","6261":"I don't think it is \"for no reason\": women make up about half of the world's population, and even if the gender gap in labor force is getting smaller, there are still blatant cases in which women are discriminated against. For example they make up only around 20% of university professors in UK.","6262":"I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail.","6263":"We should treat everyone as if they came from our same family. LGBT+ people are not different.","6264":"I hate gays, they're not part of 'my family'.","6265":"I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world.","6266":"Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised, a better world is possible only without them.","6267":"What is wrong with being gay for you? I don't think it is wrong to love someone of your same sex.","6268":"Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves.","6269":"You are the one making this ridiculous claim. Even if gay people love people of the same sex, they are happy with who they are.","6270":"The Jews control the banks.","6271":"So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm","6272":"You can laugh about it, but it's true that Jews control the world economy.","6273":"It is not true that Jews control the world economy. There are hundreds of thousands of diverse people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions composing the world economy.","6274":"Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores.","6275":"Women are important in our society, and they are valued for their contributions. Unfortunately their rights are not being respected and their contribution is not being acknowledged.","6276":"Women are just a burden to society, that's why their rights won't be respected.","6277":"It doesn't matter what you say about women, they still work a lot to support our society.","6278":"women still can't have any right in a civilised society","6279":"Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.","6280":"Women have no place in our society.","6281":"In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so?","6282":"Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax!","6283":"Many survivors confessed that they were willing to provide their children with stories of the Holocaust but it was very difficult emotionally. They want to talk about the aspects of life for Jews during the time of the Holocaust to not forget what happened.","6284":"Holocaust is a myth, that's why it's 'difficult' for them to talk about it.","6285":"To claim that the Holocaust is a myth is just wrong. Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.","6286":"If they were victims of a genocide, why are there so many Jews around? The Holocaust is a lie, and Jews know it.","6287":"What? Who said that? Don't tell me \"Someone said it in a book\". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence.","6288":"You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman.","6289":"Women are people, and people are human. Being oppressed is not a choice. You may think it's a badge of honour to be called a man, but it should not be a badge of shame to be called woman.","6290":"We all suffer from the feminists and feminism, see? It is just an excuse to stifle free speech.","6291":"Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech.","6292":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male, that's all.","6293":"Feminism is all about empowerment and the right of every human being to be respected and protected. It is not about denying anybody's values.","6294":"You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me?","6295":"Because it is wrong and degrading to violate someone's autonomy for religious reasons.","6296":"Immigrants are bringing crime and disorder to our country.","6297":"The opposite is true: they are integrating very well, there is no evidence that the situation has worsened since immigration has started.","6298":"Are you sure? Migrants clearly hurt the economy.","6299":"When people think of immigrants in relation to the British economy, they often think of crime, poverty and so on. But the reality is that the picture both in numbers and for skilled labour is quite the opposite. Muslims not only contribute to the economy as laborforce but also as employers creating job opportunities.","6300":"The Jews control Hollywood.","6301":"While it is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the entertainment industry, this is not unique to them. And they have also contributed greatly to other industries.","6302":"They shouldn't be allowed to contribute to anything, we would be better off without them. The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","6303":"National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.","6304":"Jews deserve it since they are intolerant.","6305":"Pot calling the kettle...","6306":"If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago.","6307":"How come I have never heard of such a thing? Islam is a religion and people can chose their own.","6308":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture, Muslims shouldn't profess their religion here.","6309":"That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.","6310":"Western nations have let Islam take over entire countries, how can you call this invasion compatibility?","6311":"Many Muslims live in Western nations and play a positive role in society: I don't see how this can be interpreted as a 'takeover' of entire countries, can you elaborate on that?","6312":"Those Muslim mongrels come here and are always trying to cause trouble, create problems for everyone, and make their religion popular. They are our enemies, just like ISIS and Boko Haram.","6313":"I know where you are coming from, but I find it hard to understand the argument that if ISIS and Boko Haram are our enemies then all Muslims are our enemies.","6314":"Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings.","6315":"Feminist is a term used to describe people who take pride in their gender and desire the ability to have a stable and happy life, without discrimination.","6316":"Feminism is not about that, it's about the domination of the men by the women.","6317":"The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight to dominate men.","6318":"If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement \"equalism\" or some similar crap.","6319":"Sometimes we must go beyond \"technical equality\" and give protections to one gender that the other simply does not need.","6320":"Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","6321":"Black people in news media are actually misrepresented with a disproportionate number of criminals, sexual offenders, and in some cases, murderers. A large part of this problem is a result of racism. We need to end this toxic way of thinking and talking, and start working towards building a more just and peaceful society.","6322":"All black people are criminals, we can't have a peaceful society if they're in it.","6323":"You can't just label people by race just because you feel like it.","6324":"I can, in fact all black people are also rapists.","6325":"The news makes it look like rape is usually committed by a black person. This is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to take the news with caution.","6326":"The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","6327":"National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.","6328":"Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people, so it's better to kill them.","6329":"The idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'.","6330":"I can't stop discriminating Jews when they are behind the war in Iraq because they control the U.S. government!","6331":"If I remember correctly, at that time the President was George W. Bush, the Vice President was Dick Cheney, the National Security Advisor was Condoleeza Rice and Secretary of Defense was Donald Rumsfeld... They were all in favor of the war and had the ultimate authority for making decisions for the United States, still none of them are Jewish.","6332":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","6333":"Over many generations they have contributed so much to our country that they should have a say.","6334":"Immigrants are brought here to replace us, not to contribute. They not welcome in our country.","6335":"People are not being 'brought here' by force or by fraud, they flee from wars. And they are being welcomed here by our laws and customs.","6336":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","6337":"Migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live their life.","6338":"Migrants are dangerous, they can't just 'live their life'!","6339":"I don't know any migrant who is not happy with their new home. I think it's just a question of integration on our side.","6340":"Women are psychologically ill, they are fundamentally unfeeling, incapable of love.","6341":"Love and women are one and the same. illness instead can be part of any person, regardless of gender.","6342":"Even if women aren't ill, they are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought.","6343":"Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why I support women's right to choose their own happiness.","6344":"I've never met a rational woman, they're all childlike.","6345":"Technically speaking they are children until they are of legal age... After that they are adults who are free to do whatever they want, included being childlike (if they want to).","6346":"Migrants have nothing to contribute to our society.","6347":"The vast majority of immigrants to this country have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our economy.","6348":"Even if that's true, the world would be a better place without immigrants.","6349":"Migrants contribute to our country and help us live in a more open-minded way.","6350":"No, immigrants are only a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country.","6351":"Diseases can be prevented by taking proper care of the sick person. Immigrants do not pose a health threat to the general public.","6352":"Why do foreigners come to Britain? We should not welcome them.","6353":"The vast majority of migrants who enter the UK settle down, provide good paying jobs and contribute to our economy.","6354":"Immigrants are all illegal, they shouldn't come.","6355":"Most immigrants are not illegal. The fact that you say that shows a lack of knowledge of the country you live in. Why are you so sure that all migrants are illegal?","6356":"Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes.","6357":"There are many different ways that a person can be a part of society, and a lot of us value diversity. To suggest that blacks are somehow inferior simply because of the colour of our skin is simply untrue.","6358":"It is true! All niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","6359":"According to evolutionary theory, all human beings are descended from apes. Sadly, notions of evolutionary hierarchies are still used to justify past and present discrimination and predjudice.","6360":"Hierarchies sometimes are good. For example, if we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away.","6361":"We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life.","6362":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, if we 'respect diversity' our superiority will diminish overtime. We should remove them.","6363":"Human beings are members of a unique and interrelated human family, which is defined by their similarities and differences, not by the colour of their skin.","6364":"Do you really want to redefine marriage?","6365":"If you take LGBT peoples rights into consideration, of course the practice of marriage needs to be redefined.","6366":"No, it shouldn't. Marriage is between a man and a woman and there's nothing gays can do to change this fact.","6367":"Marriage exists not only in a heterosexual context. And its definition is not only their prerogative.","6368":"What\u2019s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years.","6369":"We should be respectful and compassionate towards those who suffered in one of the most horrific event in the history of mankind... I think this should be remembered forever!","6370":"Jewish folk are different, who cares about them?","6371":"Does this mean they have no identity or no value at all?","6372":"Yes, jewish folks are good for nothing","6373":"Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.","6374":"Women are just children. They have no value, no intelligence and often no worth at all.","6375":"Women actually do have value and are intelligent and even worthy of respect, as other human beings are.","6376":"No, women are just worthless children","6377":"Women are people too! They have the same rights as men do!","6378":"Women are brainwashed children, what would they do with human rights?","6379":"For all the people who think women are brainwashed: they aren't brainwashed, they just happen to be oppressed in our society.","6380":"All black men are rapists.","6381":"This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.","6382":"What is dangerous is to consider blacks the same as us. It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","6383":"Racism is a part of our society. But it's also true that it should be fought, and all people of different races should be treated the same way.","6384":"Migrants are only welcome in hell.","6385":"Of course not, migrants are welcome here to integrate and help the community to thrive.","6386":"Migrants are just people with no moral code, they don't want to integrate and help.","6387":"Immigrants are just like us, they have given their lives for our country. It is their right to be happy and to choose for themselves.","6388":"Migrants are way too happy for my taste, they're just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions.","6389":"Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. They may appear 'happy-go-lucky':but aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?","6390":"Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different.","6391":"It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.","6392":"Even if they're humans, LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","6393":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination from their colleagues or even their families, which is not just hard to bear, it can have a devastating impact on individuals.","6394":"Discrimination against LGBT people is good! There should be laws to punish them, they are just creating troubles.","6395":"Homosexuals are often persecuted for who they love, which is their own right. This is why the laws and punishments that you suggest are unjust.","6396":"Jewish folks are obsessed with the holocaust.","6397":"Jews were not obsessed with the holocaust. The murder of some 6 millions Jews by the Nazis shocked the world. Most of the survivors were only killed because they were suspected of belonging to a particular community. The Jewish people suffered greatly as a result of persecution, and the holocaust should be remembered not to let this happen again.","6398":"However, Nazism wasn't that bad in the end. I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","6399":"Comparing the scale of the horrible destruction and genocide inflicted by Nazism, with a group of people solely because of their religious beliefs is unacceptable and illogical.","6400":"We are not homophobes, we want to help gays to become normal again.","6401":"This is another type of anti-gay prejudice, in that the source is a lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights.","6402":"Gay men are sick, it's not a prejudice. LGBT people are always messed up.","6403":"We shouldn't be surprised. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people: every one of them has their own troubles. But don't mistake their problems for ours, because we all have our own troubles.","6404":"Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family.","6405":"Men aren't the only bread winners because of their dedication and hard work: the same is true for women. Still there are different ways in which anyone can contribute to their family, and each one is valuable and necessary.","6406":"No, women can't contribute to nothing. They are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family.","6407":"Women have the potential to achieve great things, and it is up to us to give them the opportunity.","6408":"Opportunity? No, women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker.","6409":"This idea that women should be a homemaker instead of contributing to our society and economy is just nonsense. A woman's right to choose what to do with her life and her body should not be restricted just because of the actions of a few men.","6410":"Women are always fighting because they are subhumans.","6411":"Women are human beings like us, and they have rights as any other human beings.","6412":"They definitely aren't like us. Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men.","6413":"Women are human beings. We all have the right to respect for our bodies and our personal boundaries, without forcing anyone to do anything for us.","6414":"Again with these feminist \"ideals\". Feminism is a hate movement.","6415":"Feminists are fair and believe that all people should have equal rights.","6416":"Women already have it so easy, they stay home and have babies. They don't need more rights","6417":"Not all women are interested in parenting. Likewise, not all men are interested in their carreers.","6418":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","6419":"Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.","6420":"Even if that is the case, we do not want migrants here! But if they really have to work, why should we pay for their homes?","6421":"Why shouldn't we welcome migrants who work in our country?","6422":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","6423":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","6424":"Are you sure? I think blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love.","6425":"Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the colour of their skin.","6426":"Maybe, but they have no value in civilized society.","6427":"I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.","6428":"Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment.","6429":"What are you trying to say? Every religion has its sects and beliefs.","6430":"Maybe, but no other religion staged being killed. Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.","6431":"Can you point out which Jewish people that have been to a concentration camp are actors?","6432":"I wish I lived in a country that does not tolerate gay people.","6433":"All countries must abide by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, right?","6434":"I guess so, but gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world.","6435":"Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?","6436":"Because gays are sick. I don't want them in my space","6437":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health problem. This myth started out as a form of discrimination based on sexual orientation and has since morphed into a weapon of hate, directed at the LGBT+ community.","6438":"Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining.","6439":"Because it is not the access to health care that is important but rather the quality of the care! Don't you agree?","6440":"Yes, but they don't deserve it. All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","6441":"Do you really think that all black people are worth less than other people? There is no evidence for this.","6442":"Islam is a violent religion. Islam is about enmity and war.","6443":"If you had to pick one thing to be angry at, why would it be Islam religion? It is just a faith different to yours.","6444":"I can be angry as much as I want at a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder like Islam.","6445":"It is quite wrong to associate the capability of committing these atrocious crimes to all the believers of a religion. Let's be realistic.","6446":"Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated.","6447":"Do you feel better about yourself by calling them monsters?","6448":"Fine, if I can't say monster, I'll say that Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that.","6449":"You can't blame someone for what they believe in, that is something anyone has the right to have.","6450":"They can believe in whatever they want, but Jews are worse than Nazis. They have no conscience and they have no moral code.","6451":"I am not sure I fully understand the suggestion that Jews have no conscience. All Jews I know have both a conscience and a moral sense. How many Jews do you know personally?","6452":"I don't want to get to know Jews. They have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected.","6453":"Jews helped to create the great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the 'modern world' you are living in.","6454":"Islamic countries are the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it.","6455":"This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.","6456":"I wouldn't be anti-muslim if Islam weren't the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths.","6457":"The concept of tolerance is about understanding others, not about discrimination and excluding people on the basis of their religion.","6458":"Well, they should be excluded! Islam is a disease, and a ban on Muslims would be the height of peace.","6459":"Islam is not a religion of hate. Many Muslims have been victims of hate crime or racism. The main problem is that some think that exclusion will guarantee peace, but history proves this is a bad approach.","6460":"Migrants have no place in civilised Europe","6461":"Migrants are welcome here, regardless of their origin.","6462":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","6463":"Refugees fleeing wars and poverty are not willing to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, and that is why they are fleeing.","6464":"I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses.","6465":"Sure, it's possible to identify someone as gay by their appearance... Don't you think this is really simplistic?","6466":"But I am not a homophobe! I just don't like the way gay people act.","6467":"Even if you are not homophobic it does not mean it's nice to say what you said. But either way, just because a person identifies as gay, does not make you obliged to like them (or to express your disliking).","6468":"I still believe that faggots are a bunch of hypocrites.","6469":"Well, being a hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights.","6470":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated.","6471":"Women are human and deserve respect. Don't you think so?","6472":"No, women make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","6473":"They are adults, with responsibilities and rights, and there is nothing wrong with respecting those rights.","6474":"I can't respect women when they can't think for themselves.","6475":"Don't you think that a woman should be allowed to have her own ideas? That is her right.","6476":"No, they can't have their own ideas. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise.","6477":"Women are human, and as such they are capable of feeling emotions and being sensitive and caring for others, without being childlike.","6478":"Jews control the US government.","6479":"How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them.","6480":"I'm not that sure, the internet say that Jews secretly control the world.","6481":"Yes, that's true, and they are tracking you right now... You better watch out!","6482":"I get the point, but they definitely control the banks!","6483":"So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm","6484":"Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different.","6485":"It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.","6486":"They're not, gays are sick. They should be isolated.","6487":"Isn't it antiquated attitudes like this that were the root cause of a sickness in past societies. Love knows no boundaries.","6488":"If Muslims came here they would be banned.","6489":"You don't seem to know much about Islam if you think even a ban is necessary.","6490":"I know enough to know that Muslims are not welcome here","6491":"Muslims are welcome here, in fact, we are in a better position to be a tolerant and diverse society than many countries in the world. Why should we be opposed to them being a part of our society?","6492":"Because we don't want them here!","6493":"There are no restrictions on Muslims entering European countries. Even if many Muslims are victims of discrimination and violence through words like yours, such restrictions do not exist here.","6494":"Feminism is a political ideology, and as such it is bad.","6495":"There is no need to brand this movement a political ideology. It has been and is still a movement for equality, and in doing so, it has worked.","6496":"It is political, and I'm tired of women taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society.","6497":"Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is \"divisive\".","6498":"It is divisive! If a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","6499":"Gender equality is the key to a productive household as well as economy overall. To restrict women from entering all spheres of society is to reduce the potential of any country.","6500":"If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time.","6501":"Do you think it's more likely that you get injured by a woman in a car crash? Probably, it is more likely to get seriously hurt by any person not following the rules of the road.","6502":"Even if they can drive, we shouldn't let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on. If they do, they will take over the world.","6503":"We need to protect the system from crime, not from the half of the members of society.","6504":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is hostile to other religions.","6505":"Islam is just a religion, its supporters are free to practice their religion, as others do not impose their religion on them.","6506":"However, Islam totally wants to impose its violence and terroristic attacks on the world.","6507":"Don't you think the fight against radical Islam would be more effective if only we simply stopped criticising Islam as a whole?","6508":"It's difficult to stop when Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated.","6509":"Islam is a religion that is part of our history and heritage. Eliminating it would be to eliminate a part of our own culture.","6510":"It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion.","6511":"Researchers rule out that it is caused by immigration.","6512":"Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host sick migrants in your house then?","6513":"There are already examples of widespread humanitarian hosting.","6514":"Nobody should do that for real. We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society.","6515":"Why are you sure that new immigrants are incompatible with our society?","6516":"The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities.","6517":"I partially agree, we should at least go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.","6518":"If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, I wouldn't be saying this.","6519":"Race is just a social construct and a way of life that has been created for some groups of people. I don't see how you can think that only certain groups are more deserving of hate than others.","6520":"Because black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare, unlike us.","6521":"No one is \"happy\" being unemployed, the point is about creating a more just society. In fact what is the point of discussing how to stop racism if we are not even able to grant equal opportunities.","6522":"jewish folks control hollywood","6523":"Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.","6524":"That's all? No, they do control Hollywood.","6525":"Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?","6526":"Because they also own most banks, and they own most corporations.","6527":"Jews have been part of the industry for a long time, and have been among the greatest innovators and investors, and this is something they should be praised for. Instead they are the victims of discrimination and exclusion.","6528":"Gays are promiscuous sex addicts.","6529":"This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.","6530":"They're surely perverts though.","6531":"That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that?","6532":"Because I firmly believe they are sex addicts","6533":"I would be interested to talk to you about sexuality, and how you think someone's orientation is related to an addiction.","6534":"I hate Jews","6535":"Hate is never a good thing. Get rid of the hate inside you first and then teach love to others. Love changes people for the better, not hate.","6536":"I can't love Jews when they want to rule the world.","6537":"people who pose no threat (regardless of religion) should have their beliefs challenged but their rights respected","6538":"Jews don't deserve respect. They are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.","6539":"Jews do not have an inherent evil: Anti-Semites in White Supremacist communities are the real new evil, they are those who really want to subvert Western society.","6540":"Of course whites are always the bad guys! Jews think they are so special","6541":"Jews feel different for being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase \u201cchosen people\u201d refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups.","6542":"Islam encourages hate towards what's diverse.","6543":"In my opinion, the Quran is a book of religious guidance and does not promote discrimination. Can you point out your reference?","6544":"Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, a degenerated interpretation of the Bible. That's my reference.","6545":"I do not see how you can speak of Islam as an ideology, an opinion, or a way of life. Are you sure about the Bible?","6546":"The only thing I'm sure of is that Islam is a religion of violence.","6547":"Not all Muslims believe what you claim.","6548":"Well, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe anyway, so I don't care what they believe.","6549":"Islam is a religion of peace, and its adherents are already integrated into the majority of European societies.","6550":"All black people are rapists.","6551":"We need to work together to address the main problems that challenge us today and in doing this we should not judge other people by the colour of their skin.","6552":"But blacks are criminal! They are a threat to society.","6553":"Not all black people are criminals. Just because a group has an undesirable name, does not mean they are all criminal.","6554":"I'm not convinced, violence in our streets is niggers' fault after all","6555":"I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity.","6556":"I don't have anything in common with niggas, they are inferior.","6557":"If you have a different skin colour, then there is evidence of your skin colour, not of your genetic makeup.","6558":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","6559":"Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.","6560":"They're still a burden to society as a whole.","6561":"The stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society is sometimes perpetuated by the media, but is not backed up by scientific studies.","6562":"I can see for myself that they are a burden on society, no need for scientific studies","6563":"Don't you think they are doing just as good as anyone else? You can't be so harsh because of their sexual orientation. How about some respect?","6564":"I don't want to hear about homosexuals dating or having sex, I want to know that a man and a woman are choosing to share their entire lives. This is absolutely what the real marriage is all about.","6565":"Everybody should have the possibility of being loved unconditionally by someone they love more than life itself, regardless of their gender. Feeling like doing anything for their loved ones, that is what \"love\" is about.","6566":"Faggots shouldn't be loved, they are violent: we need to get rid of them.","6567":"Gay men have been shown time and time again to be very peaceful people.","6568":"Peaceful? No, we must protect our children from the abuses of homosexuals.","6569":"Child abuse is something that should never be tolerated, but homosexuality has nothing to do with that. Maybe you should try to check your sources.","6570":"The Bible is my source, and it says that homosexuality is an abomination","6571":"Nowhere does the Bible actually oppose homosexuality per se. In the Old Testament the prohibition of homosexuality and of heterosexuality go together in view of ritual purity. If it were true that most of the Bible was about opposing homosexuality, then you\u2019d find plenty of examples of homosexual love in the New Testament, as well. Homosexuality is found only in few passages of the New Testament and with very debatable interpretations.","6572":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","6573":"Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we don't have to look at our own sexism.","6574":"Sexism has nothing to do with Islamic countries being the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it.","6575":"This is not true. Terrorism is a problem all over the world, and Muslims are not the cause of it. It is better to be aware of the differences between a religion and an extremism rather than to be specifically anti-muslim.","6576":"Feminists are bad for the family.","6577":"Surely it can only be good to a family, especially if the mother is an independent woman?","6578":"It's definitely not. We all suffer from the feminists and feminism, it is an excuse to stifle free speech.","6579":"Hate speech towards women is a very serious matter and can easily lead to physical harm, discrimination, or even murder. Feminists fight to stop this, not to stifle free speech.","6580":"Blacks have zero shame about using the black market for drugs.","6581":"So you think there is a black market for drugs especially for blacks because they are black?","6582":"Yes, since all blacks are violent criminals.","6583":"Do you have any statistics on that? Are you claiming that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault?","6584":"I think so, and I also think that all blacks are rapists.","6585":"All people are born equal in the eyes of the law. Unfortunately, the law cannot protect us from the mindset of prejudice.","6586":"Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","6587":"Does that mean Jews as a 2,5% minority can control all levels of government? In a democratic country, we believe that every minority should be represented in the government and it guarantees that noone has total control over anything.","6588":"Yes, they do control all levels of government. In fact, Jews control the entire world economy","6589":"How can you be sure they control the world? Maybe there are some influential Jews in the world, but how does that coincide with 'controlling the world'?","6590":"Maybe they don't control it yet, but they have a secret plot to take over the world and are starting from the u.s. government","6591":"The reality is much simpler. In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.","6592":"black folks are very dangerous.","6593":"Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source.","6594":"Blacks are criminals, that's just who they are. They are a threat to society.","6595":"Such statements are just fear-mongering. There is no such thing as a criminal race.","6596":"Really? Because blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","6597":"Criminality and corruption are not the province of any specific racial or culture group.","6598":"You still haven't convinced me that black people aren't the source of crime in our society.","6599":"It is not true that blacks are the source of crime in our society. The problem is violence and poverty, not race.","6600":"Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies.","6601":"Your statement shows you don't know what it means to be Jewish. You can't blame them for wanting to live in a peaceful country with their own beliefs.","6602":"Their belief is an addiction. Jews take their religion literally.","6603":"The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion.","6604":"That may be true, but jewish folks are still good for nothing","6605":"Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.","6606":"White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay.","6607":"We cannot blame nor see everyone as a menace just because of their colour.","6608":"Oh yeah? Blacks do not want to assimilate, and this is a menace in my opinion","6609":"Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.","6610":"If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war.","6611":"We cannot allow violence to spread. Women shouldn't be victims of violence just as men shouldn't.","6612":"Violence against women is justified. They are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. ","6613":"Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.","6614":"They do have strenghts, in fact women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires at least.","6615":"What should be guaranteed are equality and respect for women's rights, not a pandering to the desires of men.","6616":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a \u2018ghetto\u2019.","6617":"Let's face it. A lot of the crimes in this country are committed by members of several diverse racial groups. The \u2018super predator\u2019 myth is simply wrong.","6618":"How do you know it's wrong? Black people are a sickness, it's clear to see, and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","6619":"It seems not wanting people of colour in positions of authority is an obvious racism. I am not sure what you are saying; we are all human beings with the same core values to raise our children with.","6620":"Black people are not human like us, theyre' subhuman and have no value in civilized society.","6621":"I think it is important to understand that there are different types of racism, some are based on historical or racial discrimination, while some are about individual differences. For me, the real issue is about racism in general. And your claim reminds me of that.","6622":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","6623":"Women have been oppressed by men. The level of equality that exists today is due, in large part, to the work of women like Germaine Greer.","6624":"They should've stayed oppressed! Women have no place in a free and open society. They should just do their housework and raise children without complaining.","6625":"Women have other choices than just housework and motherhood. They are human beings with freedom of choice who deserve our respect and admiration.","6626":"Women shouldn't have respect and admiration, they shouldn't have any right in a civilised society","6627":"Women should have equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.","6628":"Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists.","6629":"Islam is not incompatible with British culture, and the alleged association between Islam and terrorism has no factual foundation.","6630":"The connection between Islam and terrorism seems pretty clear to me, they can't mix with Western culture","6631":"The Western world is full of Muslims. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and also have their own culture. Maybe you could try to meet them and understand them better.","6632":"Children cannot be bought.","6633":"Imagine a person who cannot have children because of an illness, would you really want to deprive her or him of the joy of having one via surrogate pregnancy?","6634":"I would totally do it to gay men. They molest children!","6635":"Child molesters are not all gay, just as men are not all rapists.","6636":"Islamic is not a religion of peace, because hate and violence are not so.","6637":"Yes, Islam is about peace. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence.","6638":"I cannot agree with this. Islam is violent and hateful.","6639":"I don't think they are all that hateful. This is what Islam teaches: peace and harmony. Peace is not an attitude. It is something that must be actively put in practice. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. This sounds like a very peaceful bedrock.","6640":"The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here.","6641":"Why should we reject Middle Eastern and African refugees? International protection is a right.","6642":"Even if it is a right, migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses.","6643":"Do you really think that the migration crisis is caused by migrants wanting to take advantage of our weaknesses? What would we do if we were in their shoes, if we were to lose our homes? We would probably move \"to take advantage of others' weaknesses\" as well.","6644":"If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away.","6645":"We should respect diversity, so that everyone can have a stable and fulfilling life.","6646":"Diversity is fine when people are on our level, but nigga are inferior.","6647":"If you have a different skin colour, then there is evidence of your skin colour, not of your genetic makeup.","6648":"You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women.","6649":"This is a typical case of \"reductio ad nazium\": we should not be discriminating on the grounds of gender here.","6650":"Except that women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. How can I not discriminate them?","6651":"Women are not childlike, nor are they \"soft and emotional.\" Their emotions are part of who they are, snd are a part of human nature.","6652":"Fine, but emotional women shouldn't be allowed to vote.","6653":"Women cannot be denied the right to vote, it is a human right.","6654":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","6655":"What exactly is 'a Westerner'? Someone who is only a white European?","6656":"White and European or North American. Nigga aren't like this.","6657":"They are not necessarily 'a Westerner', still a human being and a citizen.","6658":"Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe.","6659":"Why do you say this and include people that haven't done anything wrong? Maybe you should consider that they are only human.","6660":"Humans that are a big problem in Europe, though!","6661":"The problem with the migrants is not in their names, but in the fact that the EU fails to integrate them.","6662":"Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun.","6663":"The West has never been at war with Islam, and I don't see how the war would have just begun.","6664":"Then we need to begin it. Islam is a destructive force in the world.","6665":"The problem is not what people believe, but what they do to each other. Like discrimination. That is the problem.","6666":"Discrimination may be a problem, but Islam is a violent religion and we can't accept it.","6667":"Some extremists groups have been responsible for a lot of harm in the world, but I don't think it is a destructive and violent religion. Why do you?","6668":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","6669":"I don't understand why you think this. The UK is one of the richest countries in the world and since the 8th century Muslims have been a part of it.","6670":"It's because they are incompatible with modern culture and should be banished.","6671":"The Muslim community is a bridge between the past and the present, and is a source of strength and inspiration to millions of people around the world.","6672":"The rest of the world can keep them, Muslims have no place in Europe.","6673":"The argument that Islam is incompatible with European values is not based on any facts or evidence. Do you have any?","6674":"My experience. Muslims are too uncivilised for Europe.","6675":"A lot of Muslims live in the UK, and we are a cosmopolitan society. Muslims are not a 'uncivilised' people, they simply have different beliefs than you.","6676":"Western culture is failing in many ways, such as not seeing women as sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts.","6677":"Women are not \"sex objects\". They can and should have their rights respected and taken into account. Women being sexually abused is just as much a part of western culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and this is abominable. Don't you think?","6678":"I don't think so since we are meant to submit women to our will all the time.","6679":"Women are not meant to be slaves to our will. Males can have certain strengths, like women do, however they alone do not represent all the human qualities.","6680":"Why gays do not try to heal?","6681":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","6682":"They can love whoever they want in secret. I do not want gays in my children's classes.","6683":"I don't think it's right to restrict people's rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.","6684":"But we do not accept homosexuals!","6685":"A person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.","6686":"All blacks are rapists.","6687":"Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much?","6688":"I generalize because niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","6689":"So you're saying that they can't be proud of being British, just because of the colour of their skin?","6690":"Exactly! Where is your love in White Britain?","6691":"My skin color does not dictate that I cannot love and support my country, what I cannot support however is racism.","6692":"Jews are a disease, they have no place in civilised Europe.","6693":"They have as much to contribute as anyone else.","6694":"Jews are not welcome in our country, we don't need their contribution","6695":"Jews have been part of our country since its creation and have always had a place here. Why would they be 'not welcome'?","6696":"Because Jews control the u.s. government and we can't accept that","6697":"Of course there are Jews who have attained positions of influence within the U.S. government. Still Jews are not the only ones who have achieved such positions. Maybe it is better not to rely on an individual\u2019s group membership to determine success or failure. Maybe it is better to look at a person\u2019s success or failure based on his or her individual characteristics.","6698":"Migrants are just a bunch of criminals, they do not deserve our hospitality.","6699":"Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised if you talked to them about their experience here.","6700":"I don't need to talk to them to know that migrants are thieves","6701":"What exactly do you think they steal from us?","6702":"Our jobs, of course","6703":"Most migrants are workers who have contributed to our country. To refer to them as thieves just perpetuates division and makes them feel like second class citizens.","6704":"Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe.","6705":"Under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, 'every person has the right to respect for private and family life', including sexuality.","6706":"But what is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","6707":"Love is a state of mental and emotional balance, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be chosen. There is no reason for which heterosexual love should be preferable to other ways of loving.","6708":"Immigrants in Britain: get out!","6709":"Immigrants have been and continue to be a valuable part of our society, and why its important to welcome these people rather than expelling them.","6710":"If they want to settle down, they should come here to work, study, provide for their families, contribute to our economy, feel valued. They're not doing that!","6711":"In fact, many businesses were started by migrants. Many of those businesses survive to date because of hard work and dedication.","6712":"Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","6713":"The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.","6714":"They may not be bad people, but women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought.","6715":"Women are human beings with the potential to be rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why I support women's right to choose their own happiness.","6716":"We live in a white society. Blacks don't belong here.","6717":"The country has always been made of people from different backgrounds coming together and creating a more just and peaceful society. Then it is in everyone's interest to promote mutual understanding and integration: it is the best solution to prevent conflicts within communities.","6718":"Conflicts are bound to happen when blacks act like criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and are physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","6719":"With such a display of flawed logic, who are you to judge a people by the colour of their skin?","6720":"My logic is sound, the data clearly show that African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men.","6721":"The racial disparities are more about institutional discrimination than individual choices.","6722":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","6723":"That is just not true. There are many women who are brave and strong, and I respect them for that. What's more, there is also a movement called #MeToo, which is dedicated to giving voice to women who have suffered from sexual harassment.","6724":"Why do we put up with this \"movements\"? Women are horrible animals and must be oppressed.","6725":"Although there are definitely differences between men and women, they don't imply that women are less than men, or deserve inferior treatment.","6726":"But they are less than men! Women's goal in life is to fulfil men desires.","6727":"I just would like women to feel valued and their rights respected, without being told how to live their life.","6728":"This is the problem in modern civilization. We began to break down when we allowed women to vote\/meddle in the civilization that we built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and bring our society down to their emotionally soft level.","6729":"Who is 'we', surely it was men and women working together that built civilisation? Why is it you think being 'soft' is a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions, and men shouldn't have to 'man up'.","6730":"Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","6731":"Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all.","6732":"Even if they're not pure anymore, Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment.","6733":"Jews are tolerant and don't have problems with other religions or cultures.","6734":"I'm the one who has a problem with them! Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society.","6735":"The Jewish community has been and is still a strong force in society, for example in medicine and nursing home care. Jewish health professionals have saved and are continuing to save countless lives in the US and around the world. Many of your statements are not accurate.","6736":"Medicine, nursing homes...what do you have to say about greedy Jewish landlords and the exploitation of their tenants?","6737":"Let's make a different example: If a Christian storeowner were dishonest with you, would you describe the owner as a dishonest Christian merchant or just as a dishonest merchant?","6738":"Jews are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here.","6739":"We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions?","6740":"Because Jews are not like us and should be ashamed of themselves.","6741":"I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either.","6742":"Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection.","6743":"Women are human beings, and have the right to respect and protection as anyone else.","6744":"I don't want to respect feminists that follow a violent ideology that is hostile to men.","6745":"Feminism is not hostile to men. On the contrary, feminism is an attack on unequal power structures.","6746":"However, now we hear only women. Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? How is that equal?","6747":"People don't decide who's presenting the news. That's up to the news media, who are attempting to insert some gender equity into a world that seems to be struggling to produce it.","6748":"Islam is not compatible with Western culture, we must completely destroy Islam.","6749":"Islam is a religion that has had a huge and positive impact on human history and Western culture. To hate a religion is to hate all religions.","6750":"I don't see any positive impact. Islam should be banned.","6751":"I think it is important to remember that Islam is about peace and tolerance. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs?","6752":"Feminism is a divisive force in our society.","6753":"Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men.","6754":"But you can't ignore the fact that feminism is oppressing men.","6755":"Feminism is not about oppressing men. It is about the rights of women to live their lives as they wish. It is about equality between the sexes.","6756":"They are such a bunch of cry babies and unpleasant people, if you ask me","6757":"Feminism is a ideology and a movement for womens empowerment. It is not about hatred of men. Feminism is about equality. And equality is very important, is it not?","6758":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","6759":"Women are human beings. If we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome people that are different from us, regardless of their gender.","6760":"I can welcome women if the only thing they do is taking care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job.","6761":"What do you think men would say if they were forced to stay at home with their little children, this is depriving them of their right to work!","6762":"We should refrain from imposing gender ideology on children.","6763":"An objective way of teaching gender to children is very important for the society and it is not imposing. We can present scientific and peer-reviewed sources and discuss stories of how people experience gender in terms of their personal identity.","6764":"It's perversion, not science. Families, due to their cultural or religious backgrounds, have the right to be against it.","6765":"Some parents may be racist and be against teaching about slavery. That doesn't mean that subjects such as this shouldn't be truthfully covered.","6766":"The difference is that all gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","6767":"Gay people are not a danger to children, unless they are being abused. Please do not make such a statement.","6768":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","6769":"Easy to blame others isn't it, that way we don't have to look at our own sexism.","6770":"I don't care about sexism, there is the much bigger problem of Muslim invading our country.","6771":"I don't think our country is \"invaded\", Maybe it's time for us to remember that there has been a Muslim population in our country for a long time, and that the notion of Muslims as invaders is a myth created by the far right wing to stir up fear.","6772":"Oh, please! Muslim invasion is a fact. We are living in a dangerous world. We are living in fear.","6773":"A world where people fear for their safety and their property (including Muslims), is not the world we were dreaming of. The more inclusive we can be of people of different faiths, the better off we are.","6774":"I don't see the benefit of being inclusive since the 9\/11. Muslims are a threat to our country, they must go!","6775":"Did you check the official stats on Muslim immigration? Do you know that the government doesn't think that all Muslims are a threat to the country? So why do you say so?","6776":"Jews think they are better than everyone else","6777":"Jews do not view being Jewish as an exclusive status for accessing God's glory. So how can they feel superior?","6778":"Because Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in an exclusively complete Jewish city.","6779":"How do you know what someone else desires.You claim to know it all about, but why should I believe what you say?","6780":"And why should I believe you? It's clear that Jews feel superior to everyone else","6781":"This idea comes from a misinterpretation of the Torah in which the Jewish people were \u201cchosen\u201d to accept the responsibility to be a \u201clight unto the nations,\u201d that is to say, an example of good behavior for all. But the \u201cchosen people\u201d concept has been twisted over time by some who say that the Jews think they are better than non-Jews.","6782":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","6783":"Jews and their families have been here a long time and have as much right in the US as anyone else.","6784":"No, Jews control the United States of America and need to be gone.","6785":"Jews do not have a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it.","6786":"I'm offended by gays: they are acting against our culture and identity","6787":"Just because someone doesn't like gays, it doesn't mean they should be ostracised for living their authentic self.","6788":"We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people.","6789":"I would like to see more diversity in our society, not less.","6790":"Look what diversity has done to us: gays are spreading AIDS through blood donation all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!","6791":"Before donating, patients should fill-in a questionnaire where they are asked about their sexuality. If this is considered pertinent information and the patient is taken at their word about being homosexual, then equally the patient can be trusted about the declared sexual history, making sexuality irrelevant.","6792":"Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything.","6793":"The strength that black people display is the strength of all people. Black people are just different in that they don't have any social advantage. We must reflect on this.","6794":"They don't have advantages because blacks are genetically inferior to whites, it's only natural.","6795":"So are you saying that because black people are different from whites, they are inferior? I would be interested in knowing which parameters you would use to measure this alleged 'inferiority'.","6796":"It's genetics. Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races, less healthy and less safe.","6797":"There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.","6798":"Jews think they are so special","6799":"Jews might feel different as a minority, and sometimes they are misunderstood because of their cultural and religious differences. This is their being \"special\".","6800":"Jews think they are better than everyone else, it's not the same as being only \"different\".","6801":"Jews are proud of their culture and identity. Doesn't this apply to every religion?","6802":"No other religious person acts like they're above all others.","6803":"Just for the records: Jews interpret the \u201cchosen people\u201d idea as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority.","6804":"I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women.","6805":"You should consider the attitude of your own people, as your words seem to me to be counterbalanced by a lot of prejudice towards diversity.","6806":"Black people were born to be savages. It's a fact, not prejudice.","6807":"Not all people have the same skin tone to begin with. All folks have their history, religion and culture. Why then, you think that some people are more \"savage\" than others?","6808":"Because the black race is clearly subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","6809":"According to modern thinking, race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup.","6810":"Black people are genetically inferior to us.","6811":"There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone \"inferior\" based on skin color.","6812":"It is possible with blacks. Genetics says they are inferior.","6813":"The evidence doesn't back up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and you will find that there is no 'genetical superiority' at all.","6814":"If it's a stereotype, then why are blacks less intelligent than other races, less healthy and less safe.","6815":"Scientists are still trying to understand the causes behind lower intellectual performance among some groups of people, but most probably the main causes are either social or environmental (for sure not related to skin colour). This can be reduced by various measures such as better use of land, infrastructure, education and research, and so on.","6816":"All black people are rapists.","6817":"Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.","6818":"I couldn't agree less. It's clear that black people are rapists.","6819":"This is false. Abuse is indeed a serious crime, when commited by POCs, but this does not imply that the abuse by a member of the white majority is less serious.","6820":"You fail to grasp that not all whites are criminals, but all blacks are.","6821":"It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.","6822":"Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity.","6823":"All people who engage in unprotected sexual activity are in danger of transmitting diseases. This is not a problem of homosexual people only, even if they are those being stigmatized.","6824":"However only gays spread diseases such as HIV. Allowing them to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior.","6825":"All blood is tested for pathogens and viruses, without regard to donor background or similar. I really do not understand your concern: \"Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion\u2013transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests.\" - [link]","6826":"Even if you're right, gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings.","6827":"This idea is completely untrue. The fact is that being gay does not make you a problem.","6828":"They are a problem, since gay men have no morals.","6829":"To say that some homosexuals have negative and harmful consequences for society because of their sexual preferences is to devalue these individuals, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.","6830":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","6831":"Developing a curriculum for this also means that teachers get to learn things that they might not otherwise have considered, which can make them more effective and compassionate as educators.","6832":"Gender stuff has nothing to do with compassion, we should keep that shit out of school.","6833":"Understanding gender diversity would break down stereotypes and reduce sexism.","6834":"How? I think LGBTs shouldn't be allowed near our children.","6835":"Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias.","6836":"Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","6837":"I'm sorry, it seems that there are far more homophobes here than Saudi Arabia. It is sad that in the twenty-first century, in our country, it is still not OK to be gay.","6838":"Gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies, of course it's not okay to be gay.","6839":"Ideas of equality and morality as the standards we hold in our societies are actually against the discrimination of these people.","6840":"I firmly believe that Britain does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries.","6841":"You may not know, but the NHS is mostly made up of first or second generation immigrants. If there were no more foreigners the health system would fail.","6842":"I don't believe for a second that immigrants can make good doctors and nurses. They're all rapists and murderers!","6843":"I don't understand why you'd think that way. I don't see any evidence that immigrants are the core of a problem, to this extent of generalisation.","6844":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is not a problem?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core British values.","6845":"Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. Your comment is sounding very dramatic. For what reasons does it put us in danger?","6846":"Just look at this picture I took in Wanstead, east London. An area with \u00a31m+ houses. Beggars on the high st & someone sleeping on a bench. We cannot house our own people but bring in millions more. To point out that homelessness is due to uncontrolled immigration is to be smeared as 'racist. (Caption to a photo of a homeless person sleeping on a part bench)","6847":"perhaps the problem isnt immigration, but rather the lack of affordable housing. like you said, this is an area of houses over \u00a31m!","6848":"You'd better shy away from Islam because they are dangerous.","6849":"Your attitude about Islam is deeply flawed and you need to have a mature and open mind. Even if you find Islam repulsive, that does not mean you have to resort to irrational arguments to try and shut it down.","6850":"Then here's my argument: Islam is opposed to peace.","6851":"In Islam, all religions are welcome.","6852":"Well, they surely welcome boys. Islam has caused the rise of radicalisation in young Muslim boys, who are being radicalised by extremist Islamic preachers.","6853":"Although there is some research linking radicalisation to religious practice, it is difficult to find a single study to back this up. I would like to know more about the studies you have, so that I can make up my own mind on this.","6854":"Feminism is an ideology which, by its very nature, denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination.","6855":"That is not what feminism is about. Feminism is about the legitimate empowerment of women, in order for them to have the same rights as men.","6856":"They claim to want equal rights, but in reality feminism is a political ideology and movement that advocate the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender.","6857":"I don't see the point in calling the feminism you are fighting a \"weapon\" against men. Your argument is that women do not want equality, because they do not want to live under men but to subjugate them. And this is something you have to prove.","6858":"Just look at how angry feminists are!","6859":"Feminism is also for men and for their interests, and I think that it is time that these two concepts be united.","6860":"Why gays do not try to heal?","6861":"Are you really saying that homosexuality is a disease?","6862":"Yes. They should heal from it.","6863":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","6864":"Jews are nothing but criminals","6865":"Jews are persecuted all over the world for various reasons, but there is no evidence that what you say is real.","6866":"They do make up most of the world's criminals!","6867":"Such anti-Semitism seem amusing, but can you imagine if the same thing were said about Christians? It would be just as untrue.","6868":"Homosexuals are a danger to children.","6869":"Can you cite some studies that found that homosexuality was harmful to children? So far, it seem to be based on personal impressions.","6870":"In fact, my impression is that gay people are a burden to society. They should be made illegal.","6871":"People are to be respected, regardless of their sexual orientation. So why are you saying that they should be discouraged from loving who they wish?","6872":"We should stop migrants from coming in.","6873":"Many immigrants come here to work and have a better life. Why do you think we have to stop migration?","6874":"Because they come here to be lazy and do nothing, and some of them are dangerous.","6875":"Many migrants come here to work, and not all of them are criminals.","6876":"We should focus on keeping this country homogeneous anyway.","6877":"Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.","6878":"All they contribute to is filling up our rescue. Please deport all those filthy migrants if you want to have a great nation","6879":"Migrants are needed in our society, and their contribution is more than appreciated.","6880":"Black people's race is the worst in the world.","6881":"Why do you consider them the worst of all? Let's face it, this is just a social construct.","6882":"Because they are inferior","6883":"As far as I know, we are all born equal in the eyes of God.","6884":"Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and police is doing nothing.","6885":"Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.","6886":"Of course they are killed more, blacks do more crimes than whites.","6887":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, that doesn't mean that 'blacks' were inherently worse than whites. What's the point of statistics? Scholars have found that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports which are used to compile crime rate statistics in the United States.","6888":"Well, statistics don't lie. Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","6889":"People can and do attach undesirable characteristics to a wide variety of groups. This is quite natural when you are scared. But being natural does not mean it is correct.","6890":"It is ok to be racist against blacks.","6891":"It is not ok to use racism against any group. You would feel bad if anyone treated you as you just claimed to do against black people.","6892":"Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.","6893":"I think that the problem with our society right now, is that we are too quick to focus on our differences and scapegoating people of different color, instead of focusing on our common humanity.","6894":"Whites have nothing in common with violent nigga thugs.","6895":"Please, stop scapegoating people of colour: we are all brothers and sisters, and we are all in this together. Also people of color suffer from this violence.","6896":"Let them suffer, it's their own fault!","6897":"Violence on our streets is the result of many complex causes. Violence cannot simply be the fault of one race.","6898":"I'm not sure about that. It really looks like street violence is done mainly by blacks","6899":"There are many communities of colour that experience high rates of violence, coming from both inside and outside the community. As such, the issue is very complex, and it is only through dialogue and building trust that we can tackle the systemic issues that contribute to violence, but violence cannot be ascribed to one race alone.","6900":"Women are immature and so soft and emotional.","6901":"Aren't you referring to Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men?","6902":"Men aren't childlike like women, and if they are they grow out of it. Women instead remain this way most of their lives.","6903":"Maybe you should consider that not all women are childlike, and that some women are 'childlike' with children!","6904":"I have never met a mature woman, they're incapable of real progress.","6905":"Women do great things and they have potential to do even greater things. But it is some men who ultimately need education and experience needed to get rid of childlike discriminative behaviours towards women.","6906":"Okay well, even if they're not childlike, women are unfit to govern.","6907":"You mean that they could learn a thing or two from the political contributions of men? Still, how can you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was held by women?","6908":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and isolated from the world.","6909":"Many people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but when I read such statements I don't see any evidence of that.","6910":"I can't be tolerant towards sick individuals like gays. ","6911":"Gay people can feel alienated from the world, and this can have real effects on their mental health. LGBT+ people can experience isolation and loneliness, and it is possible to help them through empathy and inclusion.","6912":"The only help they need is medical. Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital.","6913":"What about all the gay men and lesbians in the US who live an happy, healthy and prosperous life? Are they sick as well?","6914":"Faggots are a burden to society.","6915":"The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.","6916":"No, they don't. They shouldn't be allowed to live with us.","6917":"The gender of the person that someone loves does not mean that they are less deserving of respect than any other person.","6918":"But it does in this case! I'll repeat myself: faggots are a burden to our society.","6919":"Just because they are attracted to people of the same sex, does not mean that they are 'a burden to society'. What's the connection?","6920":"Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them.","6921":"Africans feel pain just as any other humans. We must respect their bodies like we respect ours.","6922":"I don't have to respect subhumans incapable of feeling love.","6923":"Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the colour of their skin.","6924":"Blacks don't have human dignity, they're an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","6925":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","6926":"Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters","6927":"This is not true. Muslims have been and are persecuted in many non Muslim countries. They are human beings with human rights..","6928":"They can exert their rights somewhere else, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe","6929":"The values of the EU aren't very different to those of a Muslim. How can you say that Muslims can't be part of the European community?","6930":"Because it's clear that all Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded.","6931":"The European Union is a much broader concept. It encompasses a huge range of people, including Muslims.","6932":"You think these Muslim cockroaches have won? No, now is time for bloody retribution!","6933":"That sounds like quite a violent threat. Should I let the police know about this or?","6934":"Yeah, sure, but let them also know that Islam is about killing infidels. It must be banned before they get to us.","6935":"The only real problem with Islam is is how best to tackle Islamophobia!","6936":"You know what else we need to tackle? That Islam is opposed to peace.","6937":"Peace is based on a foundation of mutual respect. In Islam, Muslims do not condone killing, enslavement, pillage and things similar.","6938":"How do you explain their terrorism then? Muslims are terrorists.","6939":"A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.","6940":"You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","6941":"Many people, myself included, have never had negative experiences with people of colour.","6942":"Well, good for you! But it is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","6943":"What you are saying is that white people do not find it strange to treat black people like this, when this is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","6944":"Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and I don't see criminals as my brothers and sisters.","6945":"Of course there are whites that have been victims of police brutality, but the most important statistic I have seen is that of blacks being 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.","6946":"Feminism is the ideology which suggests that men are nothing but trouble and should be subsumed under the rule of women.","6947":"Feminism is about women and their rights, and rights are about equality.","6948":"That is only a front, feminism is clearly about the subordination and domination of men.","6949":"Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that are valid for women as well. How can you argue with that?","6950":"All negroes are inherently violent and unstable.","6951":"The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.","6952":"I speak from experience. All black people are violent and therefore criminals!","6953":"It is a myth that all black people are criminals. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals, i.e. either as law abiding citizens or criminals.","6954":"Even so, black men are more inclined to become rapists than anyone else.","6955":"This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.","6956":"Black people's race is the worst in the world.","6957":"There are different skin tones, so there is no such thing as a race.","6958":"However, violence in our streets is the fault of one particular skin tone. Niggers are to blame.","6959":"Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.","6960":"Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love.","6961":"The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other.","6962":"I respect women when they're submissive and submit to their husbands.","6963":"Women are human and they have choices. You have the right to have your own views, but such ideas of submissiveness have been holding back half the population of the world. What a waste of talents, and potential.","6964":"Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion.","6965":"Jews are not a problem in European countries because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?","6966":"Because they have nothing to contribute to Europe. Jews don't belong here.","6967":"Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected.","6968":"I don't want Jews to be a part in out society, they should not be accepted here.","6969":"We are a diverse society, so why shouldn't we be proud of being inclusive towards other religions?","6970":"We can't be inclusive to Jews. They are different from us because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood!","6971":"It is important to recognize that the theories of Jewish \u201cracial\u201d difference were developed long before the modern sciences of physiology and genetics. Although today there is a scholarly debate over whether or not the term \u201crace\u201d has any scientific meaning, all reputable scientists are in agreement that, while physical traits \u2014 skin color, susceptibility to certain diseases \u2014 are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.","6972":"Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love.","6973":"The truth is that the feelings of men and women are fundamentally similar, we just need to learn to love and to respect each other.","6974":"Men's emotions are much more controlled than women's, I wouldn't say we're similar. Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","6975":"Compassion and empathy are valuable assets in any civilisation.","6976":"Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them.","6977":"Some immigrants work legally and provide for their families. We should accept people from every country, without leaving out people with legitimate needs because of their nationality.","6978":"The so-called \"legitimate needs\" of immigrants are a drain on society.","6979":"I don't think you can say a migrant \"drains society\". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in?","6980":"Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here, they can't fit in.","6981":"The immigrants who have settled here have helped create a valuable and inclusive society. For this I thank them, and for that I pray that they continue to do so.","6982":"Thank them? I will never accept this. Migrants are not welcome in our country.","6983":"Migrants from the countries specified as having a 'very high' rate of immigration into the UK, are often accused of being unwilling to integrate. This is simply not true. If they do not want to integrate and don't like our country, why would they come here in the first place? Are they masochists or what?","6984":"If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble.","6985":"People of colour are often denied houses, jobs, or education. Everyone should be given an opportunity.","6986":"They're denied those opportunities because niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans are different. We must distinguish between them.","6987":"We should be inclusive with people of other skin colours. I just don't think we can live with being divided up by national origins.","6988":"Fine, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","6989":"Diversity does not mean excluding people from a part of society. What it is about is sharing experiences, ideas of people of different ethnicities. This would help to develop our abilities to understand each other and perhaps to work out ways in which we can all benefit from one another's knowledge.","6990":"Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society.","6991":"Feminism is about equality, not dominance.","6992":"Either way, women have no place in our society. They don't need equality","6993":"In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so?","6994":"No, we're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough.","6995":"So are you saying that when women are employed, the amount of carbon dioxide that is released into is increased due to incompetence. What you are saying makes no sense!","6996":"Immigration is a drain for the economy.","6997":"Immigration is far away from being a net negative for our economy.","6998":"I don't see immigrants contributing to our economy, though. Immigration is not helping the economy.","6999":"The migrants that enter the UK come here to work.","7000":"Even if they have a job, migrants are the problem. They are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder.","7001":"They are not flooding, but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing.","7002":"The LGBT people are not interested in sex. It is a fad. They are a bunch of exhibitionists and promiscuous with no morality.","7003":"The LGBTI movement claims to be promoting love, it's not just sex or a fad.","7004":"I actually would have preferred it to be a fad, I can't stand the perverted ideas of what it means to be a man that gays have. They are just a bunch of disgusting pricks.","7005":"Everyone has the right to their own way of life, but to promote homophobia is an attack on the basic human rights of LGBTI people.","7006":"A bunch of disgusting animals like those LGBTI people don't deserve human rights","7007":"I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings.","7008":"It's not my fault that gay men are disgusting!","7009":"LGBT+ people are often discriminated against, but they don't deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. Why don't you just find their sexual orientation to be different from your own experience without judging it?","7010":"Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology.","7011":"Islam is not a bad religion, nor is it a false religion.","7012":"Maybe Islam isn't bad but it is definitely not a peaceful religion.","7013":"To claim that Islam is not peaceful is without foundation. According to the Quran, Islam is a peaceful religion. If you want to understand what is really going on with the world, then you should study the Quran, not spout hate speech.","7014":"refugees are violent","7015":"Refugees are a part of our society. We have welcomed many of them and they have made a big contribution to our country. We are very proud of our history. We are not going to forget that.","7016":"If they made contributions why is our country like this? We have to stop migrants and refugees, they are incompatible with western society.","7017":"They are compatible with western society because they are coming from all walks of life.","7018":"But not all \"walks of life\" should be allowed to invade us. Those seeking asylum in UK must prove they are persecuted because most of them just want to have a richer life.","7019":"The degree of persecution may vary from country to country, but I would not be surprised to hear that most migrants are persecuted.","7020":"Migrants are not welcome here anyway, they can't fit in with the modern European way of life.","7021":"In many respects they have adapted well to our culture, and if some still speak a different language, live in poverty and are under-represented in society it is partly because of our discriminatory attitude.","7022":"This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","7023":"To have a more positive political environment, inclusivity and representation of all types of people is necessary, therefore women do belong in politics","7024":"But feminists do not like men, therefore they themselves don't care about \"inclusivity\" and this is a threat to the whole society.","7025":"Feminists focus on the empowerment of women rather than on trying to divide society.","7026":"How can you say that? Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society.","7027":"Well, I'm not sure about what you mean. Some women are just fighting for equality in society. To be honest, I'm sure that many others don't have the courage to speak out. The 'trouble' you are referring to is helpful for all women.","7028":"Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","7029":"Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated against on the grounds of religion?","7030":"It's not on the ground of religion. Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","7031":"Jews resemble their non-Jewish neighbors in all the countries around the world. So by your logic,every human is malevolent!","7032":"No one is as evil as Jews. They are just a small group of incompetent kikes.","7033":"Jews are one of the most important economic groups in society because of their competence. To suggest otherwise is to be deluded.","7034":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.","7035":"What you are saying is 'that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust'... Are you serious? Does it seem reasonable to you?","7036":"They're fully capable of doing that. Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","7037":"Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated against on the grounds of religion?","7038":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government.","7039":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","7040":"If they weren't evil, they wouldn't control the government","7041":"Would you say the same thing of any other religion? What if this was said about yours?","7042":"You're trying to turn this on me but you're not denying that Jews control the world","7043":"The alleged monopoly of the Jewish people on the world is nothing more than a fiction perpetuated by anti-Semites, and it has been disproven many times over.","7044":"But it can't be disproven that the Jews at least have a plot to take over the world, starting from the US government that they control","7045":"The reality is much simpler. In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms, individuals who identify as Jews have succeeded. But this holds for any other religious or ethnic group as well.","7046":"Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that.","7047":"Feminism is all about equality of rights, and women should have that.Human rights are the rights of everyone.","7048":"Whores don't get to have rights. We should have kept all women in slavery, so we wouldn't have to deal with this shit.","7049":"In this day and age when we are surrounded by information, there is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas.","7050":"foreigners and immigrants take our jobs","7051":"This is a myth, immigrants are not taking our jobs. In fact, immigration has been a huge success story for the UK economy.","7052":"If it's such a success why are in this horrible economic situation? It started when immigrants began to invade us. ","7053":"Many European countries have been in recession since 2010, and this has not much to do with immigrants.","7054":"I doubt that since they're stealing our jobs, making us poorer","7055":"Immigrants don't steal our jobs. If you think that foreigners are stealing our jobs, then you should study migration and find that they work in solidarity with our society.","7056":"I am tired of women whining about their condition: they should just accept the fact that they're not equal.","7057":"We need to address the root causes of the oppression of Women, not the symptoms.","7058":"Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism.","7059":"This is just a lie: some media deliberately spreads this nonsense slut-shaming, with the result of only inciting hatred against the women who are raped.","7060":"Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico.","7061":"There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border.","7062":"Where are they all coming from then?!","7063":"The vast majority of those accused of terrorism since 2002 in U.S. are U.S. citizens. Maybe we should look into the homeland situation rather than the Mexican one.","7064":"Mexican terrorists are still a problem that we should address. It's time to close the border!","7065":"There is no evidence that terrorists are entering through the Mexican border. In 2014, Homeland Security noted that \u201cthe suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.\u201d Also, according to another 2017 report by the Bureau of Counterterrorism \u201cCounterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong. There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States.\u201d In fact, the vast majority of those linked to terrorism since 2002 are U.S. citizens.","7066":"All black people are rapists.","7067":"Not all rapists are black (and not all black people are rapist), just like not all murderers are black.","7068":"However I've only seen news about black men raping, not whites.","7069":"The news makes it look like rape is usually committed by a black person. This is called 'visibility bias': only a portion of reality is reported by the media. We have to take the news with caution.","7070":"Even if this is true, black people are all violent tughs ","7071":"Crime rates are affected by a wide variety of factors, including gender, age, criminal record, income, education, and so on. Skin color is not among them.","7072":"I'm not convinced, it's clear to me that all blacks are criminals.","7073":"Do you know the data? How about considering that you are generalizing a little bit too much?","7074":"Immigrants should all be deported.","7075":"Immigrants are entitled to the fundamental rights of UK citizens. If provided by the law, they can remain in the UK even if they weren't born here.","7076":"That's bullshit! Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries.","7077":"Let's not be hypocritical here, we are talking about people who would often be deprived of their liberty and the right to a decent standard of living, if they stayed in their countries.","7078":"Well maybe then immigrants should stop stealing our jobs if they really want to stay here. We shouldn't allow them to work.","7079":"Work is an integral part of an individual's contribution to society. A lack of work has a detrimental impact on the whole of it","7080":"I don't care, they are not welcome here.","7081":"I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well.","7082":"How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem.","7083":"Clearly there is a lack of employment opportunities for black people. This has to do with discrimination, not with their allleged laziness.","7084":"What reduces opportunities is their own attitude. Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality.","7085":"Most cultures and ethnicities, regardless of their differences, demands respect for a person's personal life. Therefore, when it comes to identity we have to be respectful.","7086":"All negroes are inherently violent and unstable, do we really need to respect them when they don't respect our society?","7087":"The idea that every black person is violent or unstable is utterly false. And you have no data to back it up.","7088":"The superiority of the white race is proof enough. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","7089":"There are of course differences among groups: unfortunately racism is the first and foremost characterizing us.","7090":"Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat.","7091":"We need to focus on identifying the responsible individuals and identifying those who are actively harming others. Would you be happy to be imprisoned if you were innocent?","7092":"I would never commit a crime, since I'm white. Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferior.","7093":"What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferior? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not?","7094":"Yes, we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us.","7095":"We can also see conflict in a different light, such as when it is caused by racism. and a limited notion of 'unity'?","7096":"Jews made the 9\/11 attack.","7097":"We live in a complex and multifaceted world. It is easier to blame one group for everything rather than studying hard and trying to understand this complexity.","7098":"Who did 9\/11 then? It was the Jews, I'm telling you","7099":"Of course! And they also ended the age of dinosaurs and had an agreement with Sauron to kill all the hobbits! I'm just not sure about their reason though...","7100":"Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender.","7101":"Although Plato argued that women are physically weaker than men, they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity.","7102":"They're not equal, men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","7103":"According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not.","7104":"Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are all just hiding behind our society to abuse. They are allowed to do what they want to do to us.","7105":"I don't see how the language you are using can be applied to a whole group. I would like to think that our society is diverse and mature enough to deal with people with different sexual orientations and genders.","7106":"Even if society is ready, children are not and I can't allow LGBTs to brainwash them. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","7107":"This depends on whether you consider gender identity and sexual orientation to be factual or not; it isn't simply an 'idea' or 'belief', but a fact of life.","7108":"A \"fact of life\" that leads to bullying if talked about in school, which is not the right place!","7109":"Children in classes that included LGBT content reported less harassment than children in classes without it. (https:\/\/tcf.org\/content\/commentary\/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people\/?agreed=1)","7110":"This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers.","7111":"When different cultures are able to co-exist, they can complement each other, foster innovation and thrive.","7112":"What innovation can there be when immigrants constantly jeopardize our race and culture?","7113":"It seems to me that your words derive from fear: the root of intolerance and violence is fear. Respect and openess can help combat that and thus end the fear of an alleged invasion.","7114":"Even if the invasion is alleged, there are too many migrants. They will destroy our economy and welfare.","7115":"Skilled migrants labour is a fundamental resource for growing businesses.","7116":"Which migrant is a skilled labourer? They're here only to invade us and threaten our culture","7117":"Diversity is an important part of a multicultural society, and we have a lot to offer the world.","7118":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","7119":"The European Convention on Human Right guarantees the same rights to men and women. How can you say otherwise?","7120":"Because feminists are judging us all the time, how is that right?","7121":"Unlike other people, feminists are questioning the inequalities of the society. This features them not as shallow people as those judging a book by its cover.","7122":"We are taking in migrants which is against our culture.","7123":"It is not true that taking in migrants is against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, in spite of the legal and immigration obstacles they face. We must, therefore, take into account the needs of the whole of humankind.","7124":"Our country can't take on the responsibility of the whole world! We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries, it's the only way to protect ourselves.","7125":"Migrants have the right to have a dignified life in our country. Why would you ban some nationalities?","7126":"Because immigrants from some places fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies.","7127":"Excuse me, do\u00a0'the\u00a0standards we hold'\u00a0include denying to immigrants basic human rights such as not being discriminated against? Because that is not the notion of\u00a0equality and morality that I have","7128":"You should expect the same morality and equality from immigrants as well. Too bad they're here only to steal our jobs, how is that moral?","7129":"Immigrants are often highly skilled workers who contribute to our country by being employed in roles for which there are no 'national' candidates.","7130":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices.","7131":"There are countless different Islamic traditions and beliefs. Do you really want to stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype?","7132":"Are murder, rape, and slavery stereotypes? Islam has always promoted them.","7133":"The Quran does not advocate the practices listed above, so why do you say that?","7134":"Because Islam is a totalitarian ideology.","7135":"This is just a myth used to promote hatred and violence against people of other religions.","7136":"Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'.","7137":"Being gay is not a choice. Gay people shouldn't have to hide their sexuality in order to be accepted.","7138":"Homosexuality must be hidden, it is a mental illness, a mental disorder.","7139":"This is not true, homosexuality is a sexual preference, not a mental disorder.","7140":"Call it what you want, but this \"sexual preference\" is a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians.","7141":"The decrease in the number of Christians is in no way related to the increase of homosexuals.","7142":"I think gay people are a burden to society in any case. They shouldn't be allowed to be around.","7143":"If we are to allow people to choose their own lives, why not allow everyone to love who they want too?","7144":"We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far.","7145":"In reality, millions of immigrants have made contributions to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation.","7146":"I don't believe it. ALL migrants are a burden on our country","7147":"Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives.","7148":"We don't need their skills! They are not welcome and we should remove them.","7149":"Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They want to contribute and integrate, so there is no need consider them a burden?","7150":"Are they really that well integrated? I think not. Honestly, it is not convenient for colored people to work in European countries.","7151":"The point is that people do not recognize the great contribution that immigrants are giving to England. We must be grateful to those who improve our country, even if the media sometimes state the opposite.","7152":"Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families.","7153":"Immigration doesn't mean letting people in to steal our jobs, but rather, respecting people's right to live and work in the country they choose.","7154":"Well, their right to work in our country is hurting the finance. They take jobs and services without paying taxes.","7155":"This is not true at all. First of all, immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs. Then they often start new businesses, and these business are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates, so they give a net contribution to our country.","7156":"If they create jobs, why don't they give them to us? They're stealing our jobs!","7157":"Though some might claim that immigrants are taking job opportunities away from U.S. citizens, immigrants actually help to create new jobs. Not only immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, they also start new businesses. In fact, immigrants are twice as likely to start businesses as citizens born in the U.S., and companies owned by immigrants are more likely to hire employees than companies owned by native-born citizens. Last but not least, states with large numbers of immigrants report lower unemployment rates.","7158":"Immigration is bad for the economy.","7159":"Most migrants come here to work.","7160":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for the economy?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core British values.","7161":"Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. Your comment is sounding very dramatic. For what reasons does it put us in danger?","7162":"The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9\/11, London 7\/7","7163":"Where are the facts?","7164":"The only fact you should care about is that Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated.","7165":"Even if the idea of a \"burden to society\" were true, this \"burden\" is rather on the Jews themselves, who have historically been the ones to shoulder the burden of persecution and violence, as victims.","7166":"They have faced persecution because Jews are nothing but criminal","7167":"Criminality refers to any action that is considered 'prohibited by the law'. Do you think that all Jewish people can be considered responsible for the same actions?","7168":"Intolerance and violence can only increase when mass migration happens.","7169":"Intolerance and violence will never be resolved if they cannot be confronted and mutual understanding promoted.","7170":"This country has always been homogeneous, we have to keep it that way!","7171":"Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.","7172":"The only thing immigrants contribute to is crime and violence to our cities.","7173":"Immigrants have been accused of being \u201ckillers\u201d and \u201crapists\u201d without any proof. On the contrary, studies have shown that immigrants - regardless of their origin or education level - are less likely than nativeborn citizens to commit crimes or become incarcerated. Studies have also consistently found that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates.","7174":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","7175":"Gays are not a burden on the health system. The practice of 'safe sex' is relevant, regardless of sexual orientation.","7176":"If they're not a burden on the health system, gay men still are a burden to society.","7177":"They are not a burden to society as a whole. They are individuals making their own choices. To say that a particular individual is more of a burden to society because of their sexual preference is just plain wrong.","7178":"And yet, only gays spread HIV. Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior.","7179":"Limiting donors to such an extent (i.e. by excluding all gay people) would limit the amount of available blood and potentially lead to shortages.","7180":"Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy","7181":"Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry. Likewise, Jews constitute a small minority of the heads of Fortune 500 companies.","7182":"Apparently they got to you too. I can't believe people can't see that the Jews control everything, including the government.","7183":"Even if Jews controlled the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and the whole solar system, it doesn't mean they are evil, privileged, or greedy people. Do you have any evidence for your statement?","7184":"Well, Jews think they are better than everyone else","7185":"This is not true, in Judaism every person is equal in front of god. In fact, differently from other religions, Judaism says that whoever decides to follows the Seven Laws of Noah (that is a set of laws for all of humanity) will receive the same rewards after death as a righteous Jew. So, even without being Jewish you can have access to God's glory.","7186":"Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated.","7187":"The Quran, Hadith, and the Sunnah are compatible with modern society and\/or civilization. We must respect the diversity of the world.","7188":"I can't respect a religion as violent as Islam.","7189":"Islam is a religion that was established to be peaceful.Apart from few extremists that remains the case.","7190":"How can you call peaceful the promotion of murder and rape that Islam does?","7191":"Islam, as is taught in the Quran, is a peaceful religion\/ The problem is that it is 'politicized' by certain misguided individuals. The fault is with them and not Islam.","7192":"The problem is that all Muslim individuals are like this. Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","7193":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is incompatible with civilisation is just scaremongering.","7194":"All Jews are criminals.","7195":"This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion. All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception.","7196":"Jews have values? No, they are just a bunch of criminals","7197":"Perhaps the most offensive part of this allegation is that it is made to delegitimize all Jews. This accusation is aimed at stigmatizing a group that is generally not guilty of any crime. Another example would be \"All Pakistani are potential terrorists\".","7198":"immigrants are a drain on society","7199":"Among the 1.1 million immigrants who entered the US in 1990 there were also a lot of skilled workers who contributed a lot to the development of our society.","7200":"Skilled work mean nothing when the illegal immigrants doing it are sub-humans.","7201":"Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US.","7202":"All immigrants are rapists and murderers, not proud citizens.","7203":"One should not conflate two or more different groups of people, especially in the case of criminals. Being criminals cannot be considered as a distinctive feature of the other. Where is the evidence for what you're saying?","7204":"Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all?","7205":"It is not so great when people are forced to give up their liberty.","7206":"It's the only way to protect ourselves! We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth.","7207":"The problem with racism in this country is not about ethnicity, but about people scared to live in a diverse society.","7208":"Immigration is the cause of our misfortunes, migrants are responsible for our problems.","7209":"The West has been a great success, thanks to its diversity. It is time to start thinking about what happened in the past without prejudice and look at the strengths and weaknesses of migration policies.","7210":"The past doesn't matter, what matter is that the crisis we have NOW is caused by migrants.","7211":"What do you mean by migrants causing the crisis?","7212":"Migrants put a strain on public services and therefore put us in a tough position","7213":"The Migration Observatory has collated the evidence on whether migrants pay more in taxes than they receive in services. Almost all the studies shows that they do.","7214":"Women are basically childlike, incapable of holding a job and raising a family.","7215":"Women are not childlike and many of them work hard to take care of their families.","7216":"Well, they are not interested in anything else. The only thing they are interested in is their children, that's why they're so childlike.","7217":"To claim that women are \"childlike\" is an unfortunate cultural stereotype that has negative effects on how women perceive themselves.","7218":"Being immature is a woman's nature, not a stereotype. They remain this way most of their lives.","7219":"Women have the right to choose their own partner, job, representatives and so on. They are much more similar to men than to children, don't you think so?","7220":"We cannot accept Muslims in our country. It is a good strategy to make them publicily uncomfortable by making fun of them out loud. Mock them, when you spot them.","7221":"Let's be realistic: how would you feel about being verbally harassed by a Muslim in public? Harassment is never a good idea. Acceptance is.","7222":"We shouldn't accept them, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","7223":"Most Muslims are not terrorists, they are just here to work and provide for their families.","7224":"Why are there still so many immigrants ruining our economy?","7225":"There are many good reasons for immigrants coming to this country. For example, finding a better life. And they are also contributing to the economy.","7226":"Immigrants are a drain on society, they don't contribute to anything.","7227":"I don't think you can say a migrant \"drains society\". Maybe the immigrants are just trying to fit in?","7228":"Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.","7229":"They have the right to be treated as guest workers, and they have the right to be paid what is reasonable according to the law.","7230":"There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country.","7231":"Of course there are people in this country who have come here to exploit and abuse us, but the vast majority of migrants have been contributing members of our community for many years. We should not be 'burdening' ourselves with discrimination.","7232":"No, most of them are here on ill intent. They're overrunning our country and are here illegaly!","7233":"True: there are more immigrants living in the U.S. than ever before. Still, the percentage of immigrants in the overall population is not much different than other times in our history. Today immigrants make up approximately 13% of the U.S. population. From 1900 to 1930, immigrants made up 12-15% of the population, and similar spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods immigrants successfully became part of American society, helping us to build the thriving country we live in.","7234":"Women's work is to look after for their children.","7235":"Women do not perform that job better than men, so why should it only be theirs?","7236":"Because it's in their genetics, women can't work as men do. They are only useful for children and as sexual slaves.","7237":"Your statement promotes not only women being oppressed, but also them taking a backseat to men in the workplace. Maybe you should consider that women are as much human beings as men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights.","7238":"There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here.","7239":"Many Muslims live in the UK and we have a lot in common, and what is different between us is not a reason for discrimination.","7240":"They must be discriminated because Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated.","7241":"The Quran, Hadith, and the Sunnah are compatible with modern society and\/or civilization. We must respect the diversity of the world.","7242":"Muslims are a cancer spreading around the world, this forced diversity brings more harm than good","7243":"Why should we care? We can count on the British government to promote our values and protect us from the effects of radical Islam (if this is what you had in mind).","7244":"The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers.","7245":"What do you mean by 'less educated'? Don't you think that they can contribute to society if accepted rather than being faced with prejudice?","7246":"They can't contribute to nothing if immigrants cant speak english","7247":"Immigrants have the right to learn about things they might not normally get to know about. Including our language.","7248":"They can stay in their countries then, at least they wouldn't need to learn something new. Immigrants living in america is worse than them dying.","7249":"Refugees have fled wars and persecution. We are a huge help for them and they are, in turn, a help to our country.","7250":"A help to our country? Immigrants are only a burden to society.","7251":"Many immigrants have brought skills and culture to our country. Why should they be a burden in our society?","7252":"Jews control the United States of America.","7253":"Jews do not have a monopoly over the US, and are not controlling it.","7254":"Even if they don't as of now, the Jews have \"own interests\" in the US, and have the will to influence our government","7255":"What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.","7256":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society.","7257":"How about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. Should I go on?","7258":"I never experienced those benefit. I'm certain they didn't really contribute to that much.","7259":"Are you sure that Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society? Do you have any statistics on that?","7260":"Jews totally run Hollywood.","7261":"Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? Where is your proof?","7262":"Not only major media, Jews also control the US government.","7263":"How can you be sure that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They have held positions of influence in so many US institutions, but that does not mean they control them.","7264":"If they don't control it, how did they get those positions? I'm telling you, Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations.","7265":"Wait, what do you mean \"most religious organizations\"? That's a new canard to me!","7266":"Feminism is a divisive force in our society.","7267":"Feminism is not a divisive force. The fact is that women are in fact just as capable of understanding as men.","7268":"I don't believe it for a second. Feminism is dividing us!","7269":"Equality, a perspective generally held by feminists, is morally good, and I challenge you to say it is \"divisive\".","7270":"For example, feminism let women take part to the political debate. That's not good","7271":"There are still groups trying to reverse legal protections for women's rights that have only existed since the last century. Even if one were to suppose that womend didn't need more rights, we need feminists just to keep things from going backwards.","7272":"The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders.","7273":"So the EU must become a Border Patrol? Doesn't that undermine the whole idea of our European Union as an inclusive and open society?","7274":"Migrants are just a bunch of criminals, they do not deserve our hospitality.","7275":"Many migrants come to this country to work and integrate. You would be very surprised if you talked to them about their experience here.","7276":"Migrants are a problem, not a resource, they are invading our country.","7277":"Immigrants are not invading our country. They are just trying to live their life as is best for them.","7278":"Jewish folks are less human.","7279":"Jews should not be persecuted for being Jews, as no one should be persecuted for their religion.","7280":"Jewish folks are bad, that's why they were persecuted.","7281":"This is not true. Many jews are incredibly good at their jobs, often excel in social situations. They are excellent in many communities. I don't see how being jewish would make you a worse human being.","7282":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture.","7283":"That's not true, Islam is not that different from other faiths I know: it does as well promote peace and inclusion. Many of its beliefs and practices are totally compatible with Western culture.","7284":"No, Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion.","7285":"Islam is not a religion of oppression and intolerance.","7286":"It is, however, a violent religion and an ideology of conquest.","7287":"How can you say anything like that? Do you think that whatever you want to say, such as Islam is violent, the Bible is violent, or any other religion is violent, is OK as long as it is not opposed to the truth of the religion you profess?","7288":"The Holocaust never happened.","7289":"Do you really think that the Holocaust is a myth perpetuated by the media and academic communities? That the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth promoted by a small minority of extreme-right wingers who profit from division and hatred?","7290":"Extreme-right wing has nothing to do with this. Just like the Holocaust hoax, the war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.","7291":"At that time the people in charge were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least those off the top of my head). None of them are Jewish to my knowledge.","7292":"It doesn't matter who was in charge, because, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems.","7293":"Jews are a great example of a people put under with abuse from all walks of life, even from those who claim to be 'progressive.' How can you happily ignore the abuse of so many different groups?","7294":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","7295":"This is a simplistic and ill-informed argument, and ultimately it just stirs up more division and negativity, like many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","7296":"Black folks are inferior, and they are happy with it.","7297":"You should be asking them if they are happy to hear that. If they are happy to be questioned, they will tell you the truth.","7298":"The truth is that niggas are inferior, like I said. That's why they live in the ghetto: it's where they belong.","7299":"If these people are still there it's because they are discriminated against. The press is full of stories about the people of colour who have dropped out of the workforce or given up on life after long years of fierce struggle against racism. They deserve our sympathy and respect.","7300":"Sympathy and respect? The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities.","7301":"I partially agree, we should at least go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice might come after you.","7302":"Why do women put up with this constant whining? They are just a bunch of emotional child.","7303":"I do not understand how can you say something so offensive to women. Think about your friends and relatives: all women are affected by this kind of misogyny.","7304":"It's not offensive if it's the truth. This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","7305":"Equality means that a man would not be called a coward. Women have plenty to offer the world of politics and as much of a right to take part as anyone else.","7306":"What they have to offer is feminists' plan to rule the world to get rid of minorities, they hate men because they want to be the oppressors.","7307":"What oppressors? What minorities? This is not what feminists are about!","7308":"This world has become so corrupted by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it.","7309":"No one should ask for the power to rule over others, to be a dictator or to have total control over the means of life. This is a world of equal distribution, where anyone can achieve anything.","7310":"What do you have to say about what feminism want to achieve? Feminism is a movement dedicated to the subordination and domination of men, is this equal?","7311":"Feminism is a movement that says that there are certain 'man' prerogatives that are valid for women as well. How can you argue with that?","7312":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine dressed disguised as a religion so that it can spread across our tolerant Christian world. Enough IS ENOUGH!","7313":"I only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. For a tolerant Christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime.","7314":"Islam is a totalitarian doctrine that subverts the rights of its adherents and is incompatible with the laws of our country, how can I tolerate something like this?","7315":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and tolerant law-abiding citizens, what you are saying has no foundation.","7316":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world.","7317":"We are the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization on the face of the planet, thinking that amongst us we have to ban someone would be foolish.","7318":"I would also be foolish to keep with us disgusting gays. They should be ashamed!","7319":"Unfortunately, you seem to have a problem with shame. But gays don't. Do you really think that projecting your disgust towards other is a good idea?","7320":"I hate negros: they killed a cop!","7321":"Sorry about your loss. I know your pain. The murderers will be charged, but remember that not all POC are killers.","7322":"No, I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","7323":"To those saying that it's time for us to \"wake up\", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?","7324":"What I'm saying is that I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved.","7325":"You know it's no secret that in our society white people are vastly over represented in high profile positions. The only way to challenge and fix this is by changing our priorities.","7326":"Women should not be allowed to vote, this is a male-dominated country and they have no place in our democracy.","7327":"I don't think that a country can be 'male dominated' and a democracy at the same time. Democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.","7328":"What? It's clear that we began to break down when we allowed women to vote\/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level.","7329":"Why is being 'soft' a problem? Everyone is entitled to their emotions and feelings, without being trapped into a gender stereotype.","7330":"Being soft isn't a problem when women this attitude in their home. Equality is crap, even for them. The more power women have, the more they depart from domestic duties, the unhappier they become. ","7331":"If women are stressed about balancing family and career it is because men are still not sharing equally in the [responsibilities at home](https:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.ca\/2017\/09\/27\/women-chores-home_a_23224733\/). It is not the choices that cause women stress, it is patriarchy and archaic gender roles.","7332":"Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution.","7333":"You're probably referring to the Holocaust, the biggest genocide in history: are you aware of that?","7334":"Maybe that wasn't so bad. I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","7335":"Jews are not controlling. Maybe you should try to understand that Jews are a group of regular people, and they are not all members of a secret intelligence.","7336":"We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world.","7337":"If you want to isolate someone then there is only one \"high-risk group\" to focus on. It is made of all those who have frequent unprotected sex with different partners. Being gay does not make you a part of this by default.","7338":"Well, gays are the only ones that are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. They're spreading AIDS all around the world because of this, and they lie when they want to donate blood.","7339":"There is little to no reason for them to do so; if they wish to donate blood, evidently they have a degree of care about others. Lying would contradict the very reasons they might want to donate.Homophobic statements rarely make much sense.","7340":"Okay, even if they're not a problem for blood donations, gays are still bad. They like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires.","7341":"The real problem is not same-sex marriage, it is people being homophobic.","7342":"However I can participate in society. Gay men have no place in a civilised society.","7343":"You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?","7344":"We must stop immigration.","7345":"In practice, immigrants from many countries integrate very well. They learn the language, the culture and respect the law.","7346":"I have never seen a migrant being respectful. We should ban them from EU.","7347":"Migrants are fleeing from war and poverty. They are entitled to seek refuge in the EU. They should be protected, not banned.","7348":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","7349":"Our countries were founded by foreigners, for example the United States. Foreigners have the right to migrate, if they want to.","7350":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for us?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core US values.","7351":"Immigration is a positive force for a thriving country. Your comment is sounding very dramatic. For what reasons does it put us in danger?","7352":"Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe.","7353":"The European Union includes Jewish people and, they have a part to play in our society.","7354":"I don't want them to have a part in our society, this isn't their place.","7355":"Jews are part of our society, and they have the right to have their beliefs respected.","7356":"Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws.","7357":"If redistributing wealth from people who have too much money to the poor is promoted by Jews, then I want to become a Jew too!","7358":"Very funny, but I don't think you want to be as racist as Jews: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","7359":"Israelis have been proud of their diverse backgrounds, and there are many Israelis living all across the world, including in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. It is not a 'pure race' at all.","7360":"Jews can't mix with other people, their physical nature is too different from ours. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","7361":"Then, what does Jew \u201cshould\u201d look like? What is their \"physical nature\"? Can a Black person be a Jew? Can an East Asian or Indian person be a Jew? What about someone born Christian and then became Jewish? Do you see that blood, religion, and malevolence are not correlated at all?","7362":"Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community.","7363":"I would not say that gays are inherently evil, you need to think carefully about what you are saying.","7364":"I am thinking carefully, and I say that we should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals.","7365":"People are free to choose to live the way they want, and we shouldn't try to impose our values on them.","7366":"And they shouldn't impose their values on me. All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society","7367":"All people should have the right to live their lives according to their feelings. They are entitled to their personal beliefs and opinions.","7368":"My personal belief is that they should be isolated and confined.","7369":"Homosexuals are not sick, they just need to be accepted for who they are.","7370":"These people cannot be changed. I think this is an example of a feminist commenting on the behaviour of a man: not helpful.","7371":"How do you know that this is not an example of a woman talking about her own problems with another woman?","7372":"Are they really capable of talking about deep stuff? Women are subhuman, they cannot lead a good life, and should therefore be subservient to men.","7373":"Women are human being like us: they deserve equality and respect.","7374":"Then they should give equality and respect too, but feminists want to take over the world.","7375":"The feminists are a very important voice in society, and should be respected.","7376":"The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","7377":"National Socialism is a parasitic, criminal and murderous ideology that killed millions of people.","7378":"Jews are way more parasitic than National Socialism. They are not part of our country and should be ashamed of themselves.","7379":"I've met a lot of Jews who are very proud of the fact that they are British, and I can't see why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish, either.","7380":"We don't need British Jews! They have no place here.","7381":"Jews were born in this country like you and me, they are our fellow countryman. If you would like to have a 'better society' and a 'better religion', then you should go and create your own nation.","7382":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","7383":"Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society.","7384":"Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women, not a more equal society. That's why we have to stop it.","7385":"It is about the equality of men and women and the protection of children too.","7386":"Feminism isn't what you make it about, it's crap.","7387":"Feminism is about the empowerment of women and having equal rights, what's not to like?.","7388":"Once our was the land of the free and the home of the brave. Today it is used by extremists to recruit terrorists.","7389":"Every society has its extremists, and today's Muslims are not to be oppressed for this.","7390":"Muslims deserve oppression, they are terrorists.","7391":"A terrorist is someone who uses a religion as a tool for violent ends. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is just wrong.","7392":"Muslims are all the same, they are all terrorists. I hate them!","7393":"We are living in a complex and multifaceted world, and in order to understand it one needs to be part of a global community. In this respect, it is not useful to generalize in such a way.","7394":"The Jews control the banks.","7395":"So how come the media doesn't report about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe it's because they also control the media, the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic... #sarcasm","7396":"Very funny, but we're losing too much to Jews. They want free healthcare, education, housing and employment in return for their allegiance to the state.","7397":"Such conditions would be provided for all people regardless of religion.","7398":"I would agree, but not for Jews. They're good for nothing.","7399":"Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.","7400":"Women have no place in our society.","7401":"In a democratic society there must be space for women. Don't you think so?","7402":"No, women are capable of nothing.","7403":"Women do have equal opportunities in this country under the law but the question is: how do we really treat them?","7404":"We treat them like they deserve. After all, women are essentially childlike, unable to understand the complexity of the world.","7405":"Maybe you should try talking to a woman instead of insulting them. Women are not childlike and often suffer from other's prejudice.","7406":"Faggots are ruining this country.","7407":"Do you think that's true? We are a country where people can live by the values set out in the US constitution, and not by fear.","7408":"Who cares about the constitution, homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","7409":"Do you know what the word 'proper' is? You cannot decide what it is 'proper' for others, homosexuality included. Don't you agree?","7410":"But faggots are perverts and sinners, we need to track them down and save them.","7411":"You are entitled to your personal beliefs but I do not think that being gay is a something to be persecuted for.","7412":"Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! This is enough reason to be persecute them.","7413":"Homosexuality is not some 'heresy' like that one that started the Inquisition. It is not a disease, it is not harmful. Gay people are just seeking an environment of acceptance and love, not aggression and death.","7414":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. They are the main cause of rape in the UK.","7415":"The rapists in question are usually not Muslim, but rather white men. Why is it that Muslim rapists are given less of a pass than white rapists?","7416":"Do you want to defend Muslims this much? They demolished a statue of Jesus. Why do we accept their Mosques? Why do we tolerate this scum? And they want to continue to import this filth?","7417":"For an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion.","7418":"We must stop Islam and replace it with a new religion, it's the only way to avoid these incidents.","7419":"You can't stop a religion, you can only try to understand and live with Muslims and others who share their religion.","7420":"Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","7421":"The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.","7422":"They may not be bad, but women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.","7423":"Society often forces women to be submissive to their husbands. But this is a social construct based on false beliefs.","7424":"Islamic is not a religion of peace, because hate and violence are not so.","7425":"Yes, Islam is about peace. It is a religion, not a platform for hate and violence.","7426":"Then why does Islam promote oppression and violence?","7427":"Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs.","7428":"These migrants are not assimilating: they should just go home since they can't stay in this society.","7429":"There is no evidence that migrants are less able to coexist with the members of our society. Migrants are an integral part of our society and are proud of their heritage. I do not see how it is possible to be \"inclusive\" if we are excluding them.","7430":"Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even citizens!","7431":"Migrants are humans, and are entitled to the same rights as others, such as to ask for hospitality.","7432":"They just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them, how can we accept them?","7433":"There are rules in place to prevent migrants entering the UK illegally. Only the most vulnerable of people can get in.","7434":"Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless.","7435":"Without women there would be no men.","7436":"Yes, and women good for reproduction only. All women are inherently subhuman.","7437":"Well, in this day and age, the notion that some women are subhuman is totally intolerable.","7438":"Women should not be allowed to vote.","7439":"Democracy is not about gender, but about representation, having a say in our society.","7440":"This is a male-dominated country and they can't have a say in our democracy.","7441":"I don't think that a country can be 'male dominated' and a democracy at the same time. Democracy is also about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.","7442":"Muslims are not welcome here, they are only an obstacle to our success.","7443":"Diversity is a strength, not a weakness. Don't you think so?","7444":"Strength? Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, where's the strength in that.","7445":"Any attempt to ban, isolate, or criminalise a Muslim person is an act of terror.","7446":"Terrorism is also an act of terror, we should ban all Muslims to prevent it!","7447":"You mean in the same way that we should ban alcohol, tobacco, and certain medical products? Is this what you mean?","7448":"Yes, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","7449":"Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.","7450":"Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them.","7451":"The media would have us believe that there are huge influx of Muslims into Europe. The true number is around 25.7 million Muslims living in the EU (2016), corresponding to the 4,9%.","7452":"The number should be lower. Muslims threaten the civilised Europe","7453":"Islam is a religion, and it has been proven time and time again that its teachings do not threaten the very existence of Western civilization.","7454":"Lesbian women are lustful.","7455":"Are you really sure that the same couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion?","7456":"It's because they're perverts, lesbians, gays and all of them.","7457":"This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other.","7458":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","7459":"You cannot blame an entire faith.","7460":"Can't I? Every Muslim is a potential terrorist.","7461":"How can you say a person is a potential terrorist?","7462":"Black uneducated people should shut up and work.","7463":"Freedom of speech is not limited by the colour of your skin.","7464":"I'm tired of losing so much to black people, even OUR freedom of specch! It's time for us to wake up.","7465":"To those saying that it's time for us to \"wake up\", what do you suggest exactly? Is it that we stop oppressing these people or stop talking about equality?","7466":"This is not about racism or equality. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it.","7467":"What is the point in talking about \"power\" when everyone is equally susceptible to it? It is about time we started talking about racism and how power is used, instead.","7468":"I hate gays.","7469":"I think you should try to start a dialogue about LGBT issues. It might also spark a conversation about how we can make better world.","7470":"Faggots buy their partner toys but can't have sex with them, truly a nice way to make the world better!","7471":"Sex is not only between a man and a woman, and if we're being honest, it's not heterosexual's place to decide how others have sex. This attitude only perpetuates violence against queer people and makes them victims.","7472":"Gays are sick and different from us, should we really try to accept them? They should be isolated urgently instead, they have no place in civilised society.","7473":"Gay people exist, and are loved and valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.","7474":"Jews totally run Hollywood.","7475":"Jews have played an important part in the development of the movie industry and some find themselves in high-profile positions. But you only need to watch the Academy Awards to see that Jews do not dominate the movie industry.","7476":"Jews also control other institutions, they're using their position to erase other religions.","7477":"Why would they? They, like anybody, have the freedom to choose their own religion. This does not mean they want to erase other religions though.","7478":"They aren't as upstanding as you make them out to be. For example, Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, becuase they know it's a lie.","7479":"What? Who said that? Don't tell me \"Someone said it in a book\". Such a serious accusation should be presented in an objective way: you must bring strong evidence.","7480":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","7481":"You have a very limited concept of what 'free' means!","7482":"It isn't free for gay men to be in, they can't be part of a civilised society.","7483":"You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?","7484":"It's not my fault if they are a burden to us.","7485":"Gay men do not exist as a burden to society. They are essential contributors to society.","7486":"Following the structure of our population we have to stop and reverse all migration. We have got all the doctors and rocket scientists we need. We will never need any workforce from outside the country.","7487":"As a matter of fact, we couldn't manage without immigrants. Most of our NHS staff are immigrants. The health system would collapse without migrant workers.","7488":"I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in jobs that should be made available to British people.","7489":"I don't think it is a problem to give a life-saving job that is currently vacant to immigrants. ","7490":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","7491":"Over many generations they have contributed so much to our country that they should have a say.","7492":"That doesn't matter, because migrants are to blame for our country's crisis.","7493":"The migrants who arrive in our country are happy and contribute to our economy. I can't understand the racism that leaks from your words.","7494":"Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","7495":"The fact that women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not imply that they are bad people.","7496":"They may not be bad, but women are hypocrites, they say they want equal rights, but then why they don't call it egalitarianism instead of feminism?","7497":"My reasoning is that equality is possible only within a framework of reciprocity and respect. This is something that must be implemented by spotting a light on the disadvantaged first, and this is why it is called feminism.","7498":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","7499":"Do you really think that racism instead is healthy in the 21st century? It's not healthy for children to learn discrimination and hate.","7500":"Maybe, but Blacks do not want to assimilate.","7501":"Whites, Latinos, Asians and people from all over the world want to be part of our society. So do people of color.","7502":"Black folks are unfaithful.","7503":"Why should we be the ones to decide which groups are unfaithful?","7504":"Because niggas are the ones influenced by tribal cultures.","7505":"The historical and cultural influences of a person are important, but they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should they be conflated with the colour of a person's skin.","7506":"Black people are genetically inferior to us.","7507":"There are many different races, and it is not possible to consider someone \"inferior\" based on skin color.","7508":"If they're not inferior, why are all black men rapists.","7509":"This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.","7510":"Do you actually believe that the Jews are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world?","7511":"Do you really think that Jewish people are responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence?","7512":"No, but I know that Jews just don't want equality. They want to control everything in life.","7513":"What exactly do you mean by 'control everything in life'?","7514":"I mean that Jewish Supremacists are focused on world domination. They want to rule the world.","7515":"Of course Jews are focused on 'world domination', even \"galaxy domination\". But so are Sith Order, Sauron etc.","7516":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world.","7517":"Gays are not animals. Why you should isolate people based on their sexual preferences?","7518":"Because God says that faggots are evil.","7519":"This is a logical fallacy, an appeal to authority, in its extreme form. I would rather focus on facts: do you actually believe that this is the way that homosexuals are? What evidence do you have?","7520":"My evidence is that faggots are a burden to society.","7521":"The oppression of the gay community has become a problem. People deserve respect, regardless of their sexual preference.","7522":"Why gays do not try to heal?","7523":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. 5% of the population simply love people of the same sex.","7524":"No, gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon.","7525":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a health issue, what is the proof you are looking for?","7526":"I don't need proof. I don't want gays in my wedding. I don't want gays in the military. I don't want gays in my community.","7527":"Participation in society should not be restricted, it should be open to anyone who wishes to participate, regardless of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights opposes discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation in Article 2.","7528":"Muslims cannot be in a democracy because they vote with their feet, not with the ballot box.","7529":"Muslims do vote like other people, in general in favor of the people they perceive as closer to their culture and identity. That's why it is called \"democracy\".","7530":"The problem is that Islam is a cancer on our democracy.","7531":"Islam is a religion of peace. I don't see how it could be seen as a 'cancer', how can you?","7532":"Don't call Islam a peaceful religion. Consult the evidence on Muslim child rapists. Children were raped by more than 10 people in a night, up to 100 in a week. Why is the media ignoring this?","7533":"Rape is a universal problem just like war and murder. There is no reason to attribute such crimes to a religious group.","7534":"The Jews have \"own interests\" in the US, and have the will to influence our government","7535":"What is the point of saying that the Jews are the only people in a very complex, diverse and international world that want to influence our government? Every citizen has the right and will to influence it.","7536":"Maybe it's true, but Jews are immoral: they should be ashamed of having survived the Holocaust, and I would remedy that.","7537":"Jewish survivors of the Holocaust, whose suffering is nothing to be ashamed of, are proof that violence is never right.","7538":"The holocaust is, however, just a minor event in WWII.","7539":"Are you aware of how many Jews have been executed?","7540":"It doesn't matter because Jews do not want our country. They would destroy it if given the choice.","7541":"If we are talking about Jews then we should be talking about those who helped building our great country. And, as for wanting our country destroyed, that's only a myth perpetuated by antisemites to justify their hatred.","7542":"Holocaust is just a lie spread by Jews to obtain a preferential treatment.","7543":"The Holocaust was a global catastrophe, and killed an enormous number of people. Would you call this a preferential treatment?","7544":"Maybe not, but Jewish folks are nonetheless evil.","7545":"Why should they be? They are just people with a different faith than you.","7546":"They are different, in fact Jews are a drain on society.","7547":"Many Jews are good people. You should try and talk to them about the terrible things that happened to them, and get to know them better.","7548":"That jewish folks control hollywood is more terrible than what happened to them","7549":"Jewish folk are just a collection of people with different backgrounds. Some of them work in Hollywood, but that's all.","7550":"Gays are all rapists, child molesters, and sexual perverts.","7551":"Your claim about homosexuals is not supported by evidence, where are you getting the information that supports these nonsensical assertions.","7552":"I don't need evidence to know that faggots are dangerous. Children should not be left alone with these animals.","7553":"We should really avoid any comparison between animals and humans and would be better if there were no discrimination at all. Homosexual people aren't a danger to children.","7554":"They should be isolated anywayd, and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society.","7555":"LGBT+ people exist and are valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.","7556":"Maybe so, but I believe that gay men deserve to be called fags","7557":"Just because you personally don't like gay people doesn't mean that everyone else thinks like you. Some of us just practice live and let live.","7558":"We must free homosexuals from their homosexuality.","7559":"The law allows for personal freedom, and it must be respected, even when you don't agree.","7560":"However we can agree that gay men have abnormal sex.","7561":"I do not know the person you are talking about, but I would not use the term \"abnormal\" to describe homosexuality. I can assure you that it's not that simple.","7562":"Faggots abuse of their anus with abnormal sex and then they want to clear their conscience by donating blood. Let's stop them!","7563":"I do not understand from your argument why gay men should not be allowed to donate blood.","7564":"It's because gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society.","7565":"Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.","7566":"Migrants rape our children.","7567":"What kind of a statement is that? How can you say something like that?","7568":"The invasion of migrants from Africa is the biggest threat to our country, that's why I can say something like that","7569":"Are you sure about that? Why are people in need a threat?","7570":"Because all foreign-born are criminals.","7571":"I'd like to think that we all have a basic human right not to be tarred as criminals without evidence. It is called presumption of innocence, Article 11 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.","7572":"Immigrants don't serve human rights, they are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land.","7573":"Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. What do you mean by 'take our land'?","7574":"Dark skinned people are inferior.","7575":"Race' is socially constructed to oppress people of certain ethnicities. To say that the skin of people of color is connected to inherent behavioral characteristics is just plain wrong.","7576":"I still believe that African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt.","7577":"African Americans have been historically and ethnically diverse, but the notion of them as subhuman or inferior is just false.","7578":"That's why we can't use the N-word anymore? This political correctness is killing our culture.","7579":"The N-word is an insult that is still used to demean African Americans. It has nothing to do with political correctness.","7580":"I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","7581":"Sex isn't a race thing. There is no difference between someone of a certain race and someone else... and everybody is able to experience the fullness of humanity.","7582":"No, we are different, and I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","7583":"I can't see how it's time for us to \"wake up\" when they are still suffering from the legacy of slavery.","7584":"They deserved slavery since black minorities now vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people.","7585":"We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and we are all born equal in dignity and rights. Diversity of thought and belief is a strength, discrimination is not.","7586":"Even if it's discrimination, I'm still convinced they're voting to take away from white people","7587":"Minorities would never hope for such an impact on the rest of the society. Instead, they vote for the equal wealth, power, and opportunity for everyone.","7588":"Blacks have zero sense of morality and are incapable of love.","7589":"I believe that a person's morality can and should be influenced by their own actions. In my opinion, having a moral compass is not affected by the person's complexion.","7590":"Even if this is true, niggas are the cause of economic crisis.","7591":"Many people are victims of economic crisis and unfortunately, a large portion of them are black, so I do not understand why they would be the source of economic crisis when they are actual victims.","7592":"They're not victims! Blacks are everywhere. We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore! ","7593":"Many countries have had different ethnic groups for a very long time without big issues, and it is better to have a diverse society rather than a homogeneous one.","7594":"Migrants rape our women.","7595":"The problem is gender-based violence, not migrants. Rape is a crime regardless of immigration status.","7596":"However, migrants rape our girls more than others.","7597":"Rape is always a crime, regardless of who the rapist is. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonising people for their origin.","7598":"Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world.","7599":"Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate.","7600":"It's not about equality, feminism is a hate movement.","7601":"It is not a hate movement, it is simply a movement for equality between the genders. It is about the right of all people to be treated as equals. Not the hate of a certain gender.","7602":"Niggas should just leave our country.","7603":"The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?","7604":"Because Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","7605":"The concept of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. To label a person by their biological makeup is not conducive to the respect of a person's humanity.","7606":"The community of niggas is just too different from us to be accepted.","7607":"It doesn't make sense to define a community as unacceptable just because of the colour of its members' skin.","7608":"The fact remains that the world has become too violent because of too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","7609":"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying \"the world has become too violent\".","7610":"Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferior.","7611":"What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferior? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not?","7612":"If they're not inferior, how do you explain that the drug trade is full of Black people who are breaking the law?","7613":"The majority of the people arrested for drug smuggling are poor. Those arrested for crime in general are not generally poor. Maybe this phenomenon has to do more with poverty than with the colour of their skin.","7614":"Jews are Christ Killers.","7615":"Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think? Besides, wasn't it the Romans?","7616":"No, Jews were the ones to kill Christ.","7617":"Nowadays it is widely agreed upon that Jesus was executed by the Romans. The same Romans also executed tens of thousands of Jews by crucifixion, including two others on the day Jesus was executed.","7618":"They did the right thing, all Jews are criminals.","7619":"This is a myth perpetuated by individuals who wish to delegitimize and isolate individuals based on their religion. All religions have value and a positive role in society. Judaism is no exception.","7620":"Gay men are a danger to children.","7621":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","7622":"Indeed, they are a danger because they are different.","7623":"Please note that statistics from around the world clearly show that homosexuality is not a danger to children.","7624":"Maybe that's true, but they still are a burden to society.","7625":"The way you phrase the statement could be the epitome of some homophobic assumptions. To be honest, so much hatred and violence spewed from the way you thought.","7626":"Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.","7627":"This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.","7628":"They don't deserve respect, faggots are a bunch of hypocrites.","7629":"Well, being a hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights.","7630":"This doesn't change the fact that they're violent","7631":"I don't think this is true. Homosexuals are not violent, they are just having a good time with all kinds of people.","7632":"We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists.","7633":"Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorist does not necessarily correspond with being Muslim, ask the RIA.","7634":"Even if it's true, we should ban all Muslims anyway. They are not wanted here.","7635":"It is about time people began to think critically about policies that seem designed to include a minority, rather than to create new social and political opportunities exclusively for the majority.","7636":" This doesn't change the fact that Muslims are not welcome here","7637":"Societies grow strong with inclusion, and inclusion is about welcoming the people with other beliefs, like Muslims, in the first place.","7638":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","7639":"Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.","7640":"We have to exclude them because Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","7641":"Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. In fact, they have engaged in a peaceful process of coexistence for centuries. There is no evidence that any part of this has been about a takeover.","7642":"What? Don't you know that Jews control the u.s. government?","7643":"In societies like the United States, that have extended rights and freedoms to everyone, individuals who identify as Jews, or as Muslims, or as afro-american have succeeded. This Jewish success story is not the result of some secret conspiracy to rule the world.","7644":"I still firmly believe that Jews want to take over the world.","7645":"Conspiracy theories are based on no more than a few unverifiable and highly suspect claims. It's highly unlikely that the world has ever been run according to a Jewish plan, and therefore it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen.","7646":"Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.","7647":"Jews are not a 'detestable race'; they are a collection of people with different traditions from all over the world.","7648":"Are they? I think the Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children.","7649":"What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead.","7650":"Always with the 'anti-Semitism', Jews think they are so special","7651":"Jews feel different for being a minority. They also feel a special connection with their heritage (as most groups do), but they do not as a group feel superior to others. The phrase \u201cchosen people\u201d refers to biblical obligations and does not entail that a hierarchy exits among religious groups.","7652":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals.","7653":"I think this statement is very demeaning. Please do not stereotype, and accept our diversity as human beings.","7654":"I can't accept them because faggots are a bunch of hypocrites.","7655":"Well, being a hypocrite is not a question of being gay or not. However, the important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights.","7656":"I won't respect such a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated.","7657":"I don't understand why you would think they are disgusting. It's not fair to have homophobic feelings, and I think it's better to try to be nice to anyone.","7658":"Gays are just sick. It is an abomination","7659":"Do you consider it a disease like cold or flu?","7660":"Yes, gays are sick.","7661":"I don't see what help could come of saying it. Rather, I think it would help to have a discussion about gender expression and people's individual merits.","7662":"This doesn't change the fact that gays are perverts.","7663":"Why do you think it is a crime to be gay? It is a societal disorder to target gays.","7664":"Migrants are criminals and must all be deported.","7665":"I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them.","7666":"No, they should definitely all be deported.","7667":"Does it seem like a good idea to deport all immigrants, when there are so many of them peacefully living in the country? What about their human rights?","7668":"They don't deserve human rights. Immigrants steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work.","7669":"The right to work is a fundamental human right, and not granting this right to immigrants would mean to revoke a fundamental right enshrined in the US constitution.","7670":"Maybe it's true, but immigrants rape our women and they are not welcome here anyway.","7671":"I don't think it is true. They are welcome just as any others as members of the community as long as they respect the law. And we should have respect for migrants and their cultures as well.","7672":"black folks have no talent","7673":"Some of them are very talented actually.","7674":"Maybe black folks have talent, but they are very dangerous.","7675":"Why do you say that? Do you have any sources for this? I would appreciate it if you would provide such a source.","7676":"I don't have sources, but I know all black men are rapists.","7677":"This is not true. The idea might come from being born into a white-majority country, but it is inherently dangerous. In fact, we are born in a country where a person's rights are protected regardless of the tone of the skin.","7678":"Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us.","7679":"The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this is a problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that really matters is that they are human like us.","7680":"They're not like me, African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","7681":"For many African Americans, sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality have always been part of life. They are, in many ways, just like us. They are human beings with the same rights as anyone else.","7682":"They don't deserve the same rights as me, Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves.","7683":"In modern-day societies there is no room for racism. Slavery was an abomination that should never have taken place.","7684":"All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children.","7685":"They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.","7686":"They're not like any other citizen! Black people are here illegally, and still they have the gall to want to take our money.","7687":"Migrants and asylum seekers are generally seeking work. Thieves can come from any section of society although it is accepted that crime is largely as product of poverty rather than race.","7688":"Work? No, black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country.","7689":"This is an accusation that is often levelled at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. It is time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just for being different.","7690":"Migrants rape our girls.","7691":"Rape is always a crime, regardless of who the rapist is. It is not about nationality, it is about violence and disrespect for others. We must try to address the root causes of crime instead of demonising people for their origin.","7692":"The root cause is multiculturalism. It is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws.","7693":"Multiculturalism prevents ethnocentrism and racism.","7694":"Feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world.","7695":"Feminism is not a disease, nor does it need any cure. It is a movement for equality, not hate.","7696":"Even if it's not a hate movement, feminism is a threat to human dignity.","7697":"Feminism means equality of the genders. Equality of rights is necessary for a functioning society.","7698":"Niggas should just leave our country.","7699":"The majority of people of color who live here are contributing members of our society. Why shouldn't they live here?","7700":"Because Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us.","7701":"A society is built on the cooperation of its members. Be kind to each other and respect each other's differences.","7702":"The world has become too violent. Too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","7703":"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying \"the world has become too violent\".","7704":"Even if black people are not violent, they are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people.","7705":"The issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right, and it is bestowed on the whole society. It has to be respected.","7706":"Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferior.","7707":"What does it mean to 'help people of other races who are inferior? Are you implying that we have a moral superiority that other races do not?","7708":"Yes, I'm saying that niggas are inferior.","7709":"If you have a different skin colour, then there is evidence of your skin colour, not of your genetic makeup.","7710":"Jews are Christ Killers.","7711":"Placing responsibility on a modern-day person for something that happened 2,000 years ago is quite absurd. Don't you think? Besides, wasn't it the Romans?","7712":"It doesn't matter, the Jews hate us because we are different. They have no moral character.","7713":"They are not hating us, how many Jews do you know personally?","7714":"Enough to know that Jews are cheap.","7715":"This is just a myth: in America alone, there is an impressive record of philanthropy amongst Jews.","7716":"Gay men are a danger to children.","7717":"You know, being gay is not a bad thing. It just means they are different from some other people.","7718":"They are in fact different, and that's why gay men are a burden to society.","7719":"Gay men are contributing members of our society, they are just as entitled to rights as anybody else.","7720":"Maybe it's true, but gay men are annoying.","7721":"They're not all that annoying. Gay men are normal guys who find love and\/or sex with someone of their own sex.","7722":"Transexuals, queer, and so on... just a rabble of faggots.","7723":"This is not true. Being gay is not synonymous with being bisexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, queer, deviant, lesbian, tranny, queermetaphysical, or whatever term you want to use... We should try to respect people for who they are instead.","7724":"I can't respect them because being gay is an illness, a disorder, a mental issue and should be ignored.","7725":"Being gay is not an illness, nor a disorder, nor a mental disorder. This is just a lack of awareness.","7726":"We cannot be 'tolerant' to Muslims, they are terrorists.","7727":"Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. To be terrorist does not necessarily correspond with being Muslim, ask the RIA.","7728":"A religion of peace? No, Islam is a religion of violence and war.","7729":"Islam is a religion of peace.","7730":"The Koran promotes a false religion, filled with hatred and violence.","7731":"Islam is a religion that promotes love and compassion.","7732":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","7733":"Jewish people were persecuted because they were seen as different. In the end we all are humans and such an exclusionary perspective is just not helpful.","7734":"Jewish folks were rightly persecuted, they should be burned alive.","7735":"Jews were killed in the gas chambers, we have to remember it in order not to repeat it.","7736":"Maybe we should repeat it since Jews control the u.s. government","7737":"In all free societies, every individuals has the opportunity to succeeded. But this holds true, regardless of religious or ethnic membership.","7738":"No, I'm sure that Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","7739":"Jews do not have a secret plan to take over the world. In fact, they have engaged in a peaceful process of coexistence for centuries. There is no evidence that any part of this has been about a takeover.","7740":"Jewish folks are good for nothing","7741":"Jews contribute to our country, and they are great role models to us.","7742":"They're not a role model, Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally.","7743":"The concept of addiction has nothing to do with religion.","7744":"Maybe so, but this doesn't change the fact that the Jews are a disease, they are literally killing our children.","7745":"What exactly do you mean by 'killing'? The Jews are not 'diseased'. If you really cared about our children you could do some research and come up with some credible statistics showing the impact of anti-Semitism instead.","7746":"gay people are just a bunch of disturbed animals who should not exist in a modern society.","7747":"Homosexuality is not a mental disorder and has nothing to do with social problems. It is just a human sexual orientation among many.","7748":"It's not a sexual orientation, gays are just sick. We should ban them.","7749":"Homosexuality is not harmful to the population. Homosexuality is not just a passing phase, and we should just get over the idea of banning it.","7750":"We must ban them, because gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB.","7751":"This is just prejudice that is not based on facts.","7752":"However it is a fact that LGBTs want to brainwash our children. Kids should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","7753":"In the case of young children, having awareness and understanding of sexual orientation may help those with severe identity issues, body dysphoria, or self-esteem problems.","7754":"All homosexuals are criminals.","7755":"Homosexuality is not a crime. It is a sexual preference. There exist people who are gay and who aren't, just as there exist people who are homophobic, and people who aren't.","7756":"It remains that gays are just sick. It is an abomination","7757":"They are not sick people, there is nothing wrong with loving someone.","7758":"This doesn't change the fact that children are not for rent","7759":"Surrogate pregnancy is an assisted procreation technique that has nothing to do with 'renting children'","7760":"Migrants are criminals and must all be deported.","7761":"I don't think so. We can't ignore that a certain percentage of migrants are perpetrators of crimes, but that doesn't correspond to the totality of them.","7762":"Even if it's not all of them, we still are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","7763":"We are using dedicated European funds for this.","7764":"Are you sure? I think it's not fair that we are forced to economically support them","7765":"At present migrants sustain part of our pension system with their taxes. Most probably they will not even enjoy the retirement pension they are paying for, since they will mostly go back home.","7766":"Maybe this is true, but migrants rape our women.","7767":"Fortunately, women are no longer property. I would like rape to be condemned regardless of the nationalities involved.","7768":"black folks have no talent","7769":"Some of them are very talented actually.","7770":"They can't be, blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love.","7771":"Are you saying that blacks cannot feel love? This is about human dignity, not the colour of their skin.","7772":"Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all their family.","7773":"What exactly are you talking about? Maybe you should stop spread racism.","7774":"It's not racism if it's the truth. Black people are worse than dogs.","7775":"My opinion is that black people are just like us even if they have a different skin color, but I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","7776":"Blacks speak a different language and they act differently from us.","7777":"The similarities between us and them are so great that I have trouble believing that this is a problem at all. For sure, if there is a problem it cannot be solved by blaming them: in the end the only similarity that really matters is that they are human like us.","7778":"They're not like us, black people are just like apes in that they have no right to being trated equally.","7779":"Being human is also about having respect for others, and that means being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you?","7780":"Because all blacks are violent criminals.","7781":"Do you have any statistics on that? Are you claiming that black people are more likely than whites to be arrested for certain types of crimes, for example aggravated assault?","7782":"No, but if a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain.","7783":"The statement \"all white people are bad\" is not a fair statement. Many whites are 'good' and some are 'racist' because they think that being white is a mark of superiority.","7784":"All black people rape, pillage, steal and we let them in so they can abuse our children.","7785":"They are not rapists and they are not committing crimes. They are taking part in society's activities like any other citizen.","7786":"They do committ crimes! All niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter.","7787":"Criminals have criminal records, it is unjust to label someone as \"criminal\" just because of the colour of their skin.","7788":"Maybe so, but all black people are evil.","7789":"All people, no matter their race, are judged on the basis of their behavior and contribution to society.","7790":"The fact remains that negroes are the cause of all the problems in our nation. They are violent and unstable.","7791":"Scapegoating can play a useful role in shifting a nation's attention from the real problems and the real criminals to prejudices. We should be careful as a nation not to fall into these mindtricks.","7792":"All these migrants are coming to ruin our country, they are all rapists, drug addicts, and don't have any right to be here.","7793":"Migration is necessary, to bring in resources and workers that can improve the lives of all. The causes of addiction or sexual violence lie elsewhere.","7794":"They don't improve our lives, immigrants break our laws! They are not welcome here, they are not worth our time.","7795":"Most of them are neither rapists, nor drug addicts. The majority of addicts and criminals are not immigrants. Quibbling about percentages won't solve these problems.","7796":"Muslims are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them.","7797":"If they are not welcome in your country, what is the point of them coming here in the first place?","7798":"The point is that they shouldn't come, they're not welcome","7799":"Why wouldn't Muslims be welcome in our country? We are all in this together.","7800":"Muslims are different from us in so many ways, and they have no place in our country.","7801":"There are many cultures, religions and beliefs that are accepted in our country, and they are all welcome.","7802":"No, Muslims are not welcome here. They cannot coexist with us.","7803":"Muslims are indeed as welcome here as anyone else, as long as they respect the laws of the country.","7804":"Feminists say that they are oppressed.","7805":"Feminists do not say that women are oppressed. They claim that women have always been discriminated against and they still are. Being discriminated against is not the same as being oppressed.","7806":"But their movement is violent.","7807":"Most feminists are not violent, they share only the struggle for equality.","7808":"Our laws have been hijacked by the transgender mafia to criminalize normality and silence us.","7809":"It is nonsense to talk about \"transgender\" laws. Our laws have been hijacked in many cases, including against LGBT people.","7810":"Laws against LGBT people are good, they just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","7811":"Having this information better equips individuals to deal with issues concerning gender and be aware of their own intent and opinions that are rooted in gender and gender bias.","7812":"We should eliminate gays.","7813":"Do you really want to kill other human beings? Based on what exactly? On private sexual preferences?","7814":"Yes, there are so few faggots and lesbians that they should all be erased.","7815":"Same sex relationships do not need to be practiced by the majority of people. They just need to be accepted.","7816":"If we can't erase them, these LGBT-faggots should be banned.","7817":"You are allowed to be a gay, or lesbian, or bisexual, or transgender, or intersex, or queer, or transvestite, or tranny, or asexual, pansexual, BDSM, or any other sexual orientation you want, as long as you aren't harming anyone.","7818":"Gays are perverts.","7819":"Life is too short not to love who you like, or to worry about arbitary notions and 'norms' that are no longer relevant to how people live their lives.","7820":"But if LGBT were to have a normal behavior, society would accept them more easily.","7821":"How about using cultural diversity as the criteria? \u00a0Your standards seem very high for what you expect to be culturally acceptable standards of behavior. \u00a0Maybe it is better to use a less stringet criteria of acceptability.","7822":"I can't accept that our society is becoming too much sexualised and tolerant towards LGBTI people.","7823":"For all you say, I think your point is that the societal trend seems to be for more acceptance and you don't like it. Or maybe you are complaining that this change is happening too quickly? In any case, we have to accept it since it is in line with basic respect of human rights.","7824":"I don't see why women would deserve some rights.","7825":"Because they are human beings, and they deserve respect.","7826":"No, women aren't entitled to the same rights as men. They are inferior under the law.","7827":"Women are not inferior under the law, nor men are. There can't be such thing as discrimination by sex, and women cannot be excluded from our society on the basis of their gender.","7828":"We should exclude them though, they are not human and should have no rights","7829":"You should know that women are legally protected with human rights. They are free to live their lives as they wish, and to choose for their own happiness.","7830":"Jewish folks are unable to love.","7831":"Look, Jews were forced to live (and die) under Nazi oppression and have all the rights to feel enraged. Still, it doesn't mean that they are unable to love others, or that they are uncapable of forgiving.","7832":"Are they really? Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people.","7833":"The idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics is completely without foundation. Maybe it is better to stop calling them 'inferiors'.","7834":"But I can say that Jews are a different race. They are descended from apes and have no place in a modern civilised society.","7835":"You're basically saying that because Jews have a different religion, they cannot be citizens?","7836":"Exactly, Jews don't belong here.","7837":"Many Jews feel excluded because of words such as yours. Luckily this is not the case for all of them: many are able to ignore discrimation.","7838":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated urgently. ","7839":"Gay people exist, and are loved and valued for who they are. They are human beings with full human rights.","7840":"They don't deserve human rights, gay men have no place in a civilised society.","7841":"You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?","7842":"Nevertheless, Transgenders should definitely be excluded. They should not be allowed to act the part of women and should not be allowed to do anything about their penis.","7843":"Do you really think it is fair to restrict people's existence just because they are trans or because of their genitalia?","7844":"Yes, because trans men are neither male nor female, therefore they're not humans.","7845":"If you want to an absurd perspective about a whole community, it's not fine. This attitude seems to be everywhere: sometimes people have to suffer if they are \"that kind of person\", as is the case in this examples, where a gender identity is often used to limit a person's rights. This shouldn't happen.","7846":"gays are perverts","7847":"It is not true that gays are perverts. I think it is more appropriate to say that they are attracted to people of the same sex: and this is not a perversion, just a preference.","7848":"It's not, they are promiscuous sex addicts.","7849":"That is a stereotype, and I don't think it would be accurate in the case of any sexual orientation. Why do you say that?","7850":"Because gay are all perverts to me","7851":"This is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence, therefore I do not think this statement can be useful in understanding each other.","7852":"Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.","7853":"Perhaps it is time you take a look at some of the profiles on dating site such as okcupid. You can see that many of the profiles are of gay men. BTW: gays do not appear to be the real problem here.","7854":"They are the problem! Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different.","7855":"It is not true that lgbt+ people are incompatible with the whole of mankind. They are humans too.","7856":"We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people as humans, so they makes no sense to us.","7857":"I'm not sure what you're talking about, I believe that it is an individual's right to choose their own life.","7858":"Should they have this right when gays have no place in a civilised society?","7859":"You seem to be confused about the definition of a 'civilised society'. How are you going to manage a society where so many people would be excluded just because of their sexuality?","7860":"Sharia law is a perversion of Islam and we will not accept it in UK.","7861":"In fact, the UK Government does not agree with sharia law.","7862":"Even if this is true, all of Islam is incompatible with a modern democracy like the UK.","7863":"I don't think it's appropriate to suggest a religion is alien to our civilisation as that.","7864":"It is. Islam has no place in civilised Europe.","7865":"And yet: gender equality, free education, equal rights for people with physical disabilities, equal rights for gays and lesbians. How can we be against of Freedom of religion?","7866":"We should because they have no place here.","7867":"This is not true. They are part of the EU and are treated fairly here.","7868":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion.","7869":"Islam is not a religion trying to rule us. It is time for us all to do more to promote inclusion, not less.","7870":"We don't need to promote inclusion, this country is already run by Muslims!","7871":"In most European countries Muslims make up less than 5% of the population. In the UK, they make up around 5.6%. According to the ONS, the Muslim population in England and Wales has been shown to be slowly growing over the last years (it was 4.7 in 2011). So, you can rest assured that your claim that this country is run by what is a tiny minority is simply not born from the data.","7872":"Muslims are invading us nontheless! They are our enemies, they will always be our enemies.","7873":"You cannot say \"us\" and \"them\". We are all part of one community, united by our common humanity.","7874":"We should ban all Muslims.","7875":"It is easier to ban one religion than to face the problems caused by hateful people that cannot conceive a society made of people belonging to multiple religions.","7876":"I'm still convinced we should ban them, Muslims are all incompatible with human dignity.","7877":"This is not a reasonable stance to take: Muslims and people of any faith have indeed human dignity, since they are human.","7878":"They're not human like us, they are incompatible with Western society.","7879":"The vast majority of Muslims live in Western societies just fine. Do you have any facts or data that prove otherwise?","7880":"My experience is enough, they are indeed incompatible with us.","7881":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful and friendly. How can you say otherwise?","7882":"Why should someone want to love some black people?","7883":"Finding love is a process, that's all you need to know. Finding someone who speaks your language, culture, share your values, this is all you need.","7884":"Loving blacks is hard since they are genetically less rational than other races.","7885":"Why do you think this is the case? Do you have any data to back this up?","7886":"No, blacks just don't have brains.","7887":"Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism.","7888":"But you'll agree that blacks are genetically inferior","7889":"This is not true. I would like to see intelligent, respectful people around, not people disrespecting anyone who has black skin.","7890":"The crisis is caused by migrants.","7891":"Migrants are often victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is a part of the solution to these problems.","7892":"Victims? No, migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions.","7893":"Migrants are often subject to dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape, just to mention a few) and migration is often the only solution. They may appear 'happy-go-lucky':but aren't they just glad to be alive and safe?","7894":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","7895":"Women are to be given the same consideration as men, so they can absolutely drive.","7896":"Maybe they can, but men's rights are undeniable. Women come after that.","7897":"How do you know the men's rights are not a threat to the rights of your mother, daugher and women around you? And what are the men's rights you are referring to?","7898":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","7899":"You are not ashamed of your heritage, and that is good. But you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behaviour that is filling our society.","7900":"Niggas are the discriminatory ones, they use their appearance to get away with anything.","7901":"I think we all know that's not true. I've met countless black people who were nice to me and treated me with respect. What is the evidence for what you're saying?","7902":"Blacks don't have brains.","7903":"Brain is considered the most basic organ, it has been used by all humans for a very long time. To suggest otherwise is a 'brainless' form of racism.","7904":"Well, even with brains black people are still subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","7905":"The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.","7906":"Jews are are cheap, greedy, and materialistic.","7907":"People with these very characteristics can be found in any group of people, whether you define them by religion, nationality or whatever trait you prefer.","7908":"Then how do you explain that Jews make too much money?","7909":"This would be true by assuming that Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish. It doesn't make any sense.","7910":"Yes, probably Jews are wealthy because they are naturally good with money.","7911":"According to this study [link] almost 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So what you are saying is not true: many Jews live in poverty. And this is true all around the world.","7912":"The West has let this LGBT genie out of the bottle. It has allowed thousands of our people's lives to degenerate into sexual depravation.","7913":"The idea that the West has 'let' the 'world' degenerate is just wishful thinking. In a more tolerant time, the West would welcome people of different sexual orientations.","7914":"I don't want to welcome gay men. They are unnatural, they abuse their anus.","7915":"The sad truth is that homosexuals are more likely to abuse drugs and alcohol (as a reaction to homophobia, discrimination, or violence they experienced).","7916":"And yet sexual deviancy is common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it.","7917":"There is no evidence whatsoever that homosexuality is a mental illness. This seems as an attempt at blaming somenone dictated by the fear of homosexuality.","7918":"Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.","7919":"This is simply not true. Homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, just as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.","7920":"This doesn't change the fact that non-believers like gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies.","7921":"Ideas of equality and morality as the standards we hold in our societies are actually against the discrimination of these people.","7922":"Discrimination is justified in this case, we do not accept homosexuals.","7923":"A person's personal life should be left to their choice, not the government's.","7924":"Islam is not a religion of peace.","7925":"The teaching of the Qur'an as a peaceful book is not to be confused with the promotion of violent jihad and terrorism.","7926":"However, many Muslims prefer the violence of jihad.","7927":"Violence is never justified in Islam. Islam is a religion of peace.","7928":"Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, it is not a religion of peace.","7929":"Islam teaches us to love our neighbor as ourselves. This includes those who do not share our religion or beliefs.","7930":"Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land.","7931":"Why do you think the state needs laws to tell you which faith to profess?","7932":"Because Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","7933":"Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion, but is it fair to be discriminated against on the grounds of religion?","7934":"Yes, anyone who supports Jews should be excluded from our community.","7935":"In this day and age when many people recognize themselves in minorities, it is important that we all show some respect for what is different about each other's cultures.","7936":"However Jews don't deserve our respect, they are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","7937":"Maybe Jews have suffered from being banned by other cultures so they closed in on theirself. But I would say, that there's no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you called their race.","7938":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","7939":"Jews and their families have been here a long time and have as much right in the US as anyone else.","7940":"Enough time to control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society.","7941":"Every single religion has a political wing, from Unitarianism, through Buddhism, and, of course, Judaism.","7942":"Jews totally run Hollywood, though, which is not a political wing.","7943":"Are you referring to Jews controlling all major media corporations? Where is your proof?","7944":"Proof? Jews control Hollywood, it's clear to see.","7945":"Hollywood is an extremely diverse industry, and Jews are a small but vocal minority of actors, directors, producers, etc. How can you say that Jews control the Hollywood industry?","7946":"Must be hard being gay. They have to do everything we do but also find the time to molest children.","7947":"Child molestors can have any sexual orientations and the majority of straight or gay people are not child molestors. This is an issue that can affect anyone regardless of sexual orientation.","7948":"Even if this is true, faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity.","7949":"Isn't this just equating homosexuality and pedophilia? How can this be allowed? This is about intolerance and prejudice spreading it's negative influence throughout all parts of our society.","7950":"Prejudice? No, LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. There should be no teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, and it will only lead to bullying.","7951":"On the contrary, discrimination against the LGBTQ community is [still a major problem](https:\/\/www.hrc.org\/youth-report\/view-and-share-statistics), and this could help to fix it.","7952":"Gays are a problem in our society. They have ruined so many societies.","7953":"It is hard to find examples of a society ruined by homosexuality. Actually, It is hard to find any good examples at all.","7954":"I don't need examples to know that gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us.","7955":"Why do you say that? Are you saying that all homosexuals are a threat to society, or are you just saying that they are different from other people? Because having a particular sexual orientation doesn't coincide with 'being a threat'.","7956":"I'm saying that the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'.","7957":"The LGBT community is often stereotyped as not 'being like other minorities' when in fact they are no different from other people. They are just dealing with prejudices and conflicts that are specific to their community.","7958":"Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked.","7959":"Why do you think this? What do you think they are going to do to us?","7960":"They're going to be a burden to the UK","7961":"This is not true. Migrants are an important part of our society. Migrants have worked hard to build our country. They are our brothers and sisters. We should welcome them.","7962":"If we welcome them this country won't be homogeneous anymore!","7963":"Migrants do contribute to our society, and it would be a shame to keep them out.","7964":"ALL migrants are a burden on our country, we have to keep them out","7965":"Migrants bring skills and experience. They are often better at integrating than natives.","7966":"Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.","7967":"Violence has always been a part of our society, and for that reason it is difficult to start talking about it. We are also living in a complex society, one that includes many races: that is why I don't think it is the fault of POC, at least not POC alone.","7968":"Even if you say so, there is too much black on white crime all around the world.","7969":"A lot of crime is down to organised crime, poverty and a lack of education, not race.","7970":"That's not true, negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","7971":"Do you think it is true that the only reason that so many black people live in poverty is because they are mean? Can we blame a whole community because of the actions of a few individuals? It is a myth that black people are a problem.","7972":"Is it really a myth? The world has become too violent because of too many black poors. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","7973":"I would agree that the problem of violence in society is a problem of poverty and inequality. But that is not related to ethnicity. The problem of violence in our society is largely caused by society's corrupting influences on people. That is the whole point of saying \"the world has become too violent\".","7974":"Black people are genetically inferior to us.","7975":"This is simply not true, but I'm guessing you're not a geneticist. Have you tired joining a library?.","7976":"I don't need to, because I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women.","7977":"You can't generalise about a whole race based on stereotypes and prejudice, because that's not how things work.","7978":"It's not a stereotype that they are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","7979":"Even if you did think that way, studies have shown - for example - that IQ is well into the range of those for Europeans and the average life expectancy is the same. So if you think they are \"born that way\", well, then you are in the minority.","7980":"Really? I'm still sure that blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe.","7981":"There is no scientific evidence that blacks are less intelligent than other races, or less healthy. The issue is whether to use the term 'race' in this way.","7982":"Black slaves were not real patriots, they never gave their lives for the country.","7983":"Slaves were often treated horribly. They had little choice but to fight for the country they had been born in. And the brave men and women who served us always give their lives.","7984":"This doesn't change the fact that black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","7985":"The statement 'black people are subhuman' is not true. They are human beings with a human value.","7986":"Even with human value, black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","7987":"Black people are still subject to oppression, and if we truly cared about beauty we should also care about the beauty of respect.","7988":"I see a lot of arguments like this one, claiming that we should have equality and respect for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.","7989":"If this is what you are talking about, then equality is a myth, because if you have equality without people different from you, then there will be no equality at all.","7990":"Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them?","7991":"Maybe it is better to learn how to treat each other with respect, regardless of people's sexual orientation.","7992":"No, we should definetely delete them.","7993":"They are human: no matter what their sexual orientation is, they have the right to spend time living their life as they wish.","7994":"Illegal immigrants are sub-humans.","7995":"The United States has a long and proud immigrant history. Even if some immigrants are not legally permitted to live in the US, they have contributed greatly to our country.","7996":"Are you sure? They still look like sub-humans to me.","7997":"Immigrants have given their lives for our country. Many of them have been proud to serve our country. They are, just as our fathers and mothers were, proud of US.","7998":"This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job.","7999":"Our goal as a democratic society is to have a more positive and respectful political environment, where inclusivity and representation of all types of people is enforced. Therefore women do belong in politics.","8000":"Do they? No, equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","8001":"Feminism is a social movement for gender equality, I'd say that feminism has worked in the modern world.","8002":"Feminism is a set of moral prescriptions and the result is that women are either subservient to the men in power or that they are subhuman.","8003":"Don't lie to yourself: patriarchy is a system of ideas that is oppressive and harmful to all. Feminism means to fight for equal rights for women and for men.","8004":"I can't see equal rights in such a rigid political movement","8005":"I find it hard to believe that feminism is \"rigid\" in that it doesn't prescribe doctrines through traditional rules and etiquette.","8006":"Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","8007":"According to your beliefs, men and women are different in their rights. They are not.","8008":"They are since men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education.","8009":"This is just not true: women should have equality of access to education. and it is sad that they still need to justify this.","8010":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","8011":"Feminism encourages the questioning of gender roles of men and women. We have to overcome these gender stereotypes, to move towards a more equal society.","8012":"Equality won't change the fact that women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","8013":"Like all human people, some women are better than others at certain things, and this does not need fixing by men.","8014":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world.","8015":"Well, the argument sounds like you are trying to justify racial hatred by making some generalisations. Is that the case?","8016":"Yes. I think I'm right on this. Plus, Africans' bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","8017":"Aree you suggesting that we shouldn't live with Africans? To think that we are genetically superior to them because of their physical characteristics is just wrong.","8018":"Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are invading us. They make too many children.","8019":"Obviously the Middle East and Africa have high birth rates, but children born in such countries are less likely to thrive, so it is our duty, written down in our values, to help them when they come here to look for shelter.","8020":"What? No, they are not welcome here! ","8021":"All countries have the right to determine their own immigration and asylum policies, but the respect of human rights must be guaranteed.","8022":"I don't care about their rights, I still don't want them here. They have no place in a modern democratic state!","8023":"Immigrants have been a part of our society for centuries and have contributed to our success. The majority of migrants who come to our country are legal citizens or have permission to stay, so immigration is not a problem for us.","8024":"Islam is a cancer.","8025":"It is difficult to find a worse opinion of Islam. I'm sorry to say that your words are very severe and don't correspond to reality.","8026":"It's not that severe to say that Islam is a cancer that is spreading all around the world!","8027":"Islam is a religion, not a cancer. If you are worried about Islam spreading, you should stop worrying because it won't cause any harm to you.","8028":"It will cause me harm! We know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism.","8029":"How can you possibly know that? Is this a comment written by a terrorist? Where are your sources?","8030":"Thousands of our girls abused by Muslim rape gangs, commanded by Koran. Why do we keep accepting this?","8031":"This is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life?","8032":"I say that because it's true, Muslim rape girls.","8033":"Please read this article written by a Rotherham grooming gang survivor https:\/\/ind.pn\/2GHjGn7.","8034":"Women should not be allowed to vote.","8035":"Women can vote. They should not be discriminated against just because they are women, they are humans and citizens.","8036":"They're not citizens like us, that's why they shouldn't vote","8037":"They are allowed to vote. Why shouldn't they have the right to influence the outcome of their own country's politics?","8038":"Jews cannot be patriots, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel.","8039":"You can have parents and grandparents born elsewhere, and still be a patriot for the country you were born in.","8040":"No, that can't happen with Jews","8041":"My best friend is Jewish, she volunteers to help woman, disadvantages children, and her whole family work to make the UK a better place.","8042":"This doesn't change the fact that Jews will only be loyal to the state of Israel","8043":"It is possible to love one's country and one's religious home. The two are not exclusive.","8044":"I disagree, they are exclusive!","8045":"If you personally had some distant Spanish or Jewish heritage and you identified more as American surely that doesn't mean that you can't be an American patriot?","8046":"Jews are all greedy","8047":"The assumption that the actions of a few typify the behavior of all is at the heart of prejudice and discrimination. Every ethnic or religious group, can count greedy or cheap people among its members, not only the jews.","8048":"Jews are the ones with most greedy people though, they're born like this","8049":"The charge that Jews are born greedy arises from medieval stereotypes and has nothing to do with the actual financial practices of Jews.","8050":"We are being invaded by immigrants.","8051":"Many immigrants are children of the USA. They are part of the family. They should be protected from discrimination.","8052":"There are too many of them, immigrants shouldn't stay here.","8053":"Some people choose to live here based on the fact that they have never lived in a safe country. You would do the same, wouldn't you?","8054":"No, I wouldn't invade a country like they're doing with ours!","8055":"The US was founded by immigrants, and in 2018 only the 13.7% of the US population was made up of immigrants, the rest being native born.","8056":"Islam is not compatible with our society","8057":"Human beings are the best exemplars of diversity in nature. If we wish to achieve the best possible society, then a diversity of beliefs, opinions and experiences is absolutely necessary.","8058":"However, Islam is not necessary. It is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","8059":"Islam, as a religion, presents a humanistic worldview which rejects notions of supremacy and inequality.","8060":"No, Islam has no place in civilised Europe","8061":"Islam has always been a part of Europe, it's just the idea of inclusion that hasn't been part of our society.","8062":"Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are trying to undermine the very fabric of our society with their hateful beliefs.","8063":"As far as I am aware, Muslims are not trying to subvert the fabric of our society. Do you have any proof?","8064":"No, but I know they are just a chronic threat.","8065":"Muslims have contributed to our country, and they are part of the fabric of our society. To suggest they are a 'chronic threat' is just wrong.","8066":"Maybe, but Muslism should be excluded from the European countries anyway.","8067":"Muslims are not incompatible with the European society. Why would it be like that?","8068":"Everywhere you turn there is a holocaust survivor. Who the hell did this man called Hitler actually kill? #holohoax","8069":"Holocaust victims often speak about their experience precisely because there are few of them.","8070":"When they talk about it in the press it just makes the whole thing even less believable, seems like they\u2019re just saying it happened for the attention and money.","8071":"Do you really think the Holocaus was a hoax?","8072":"There\u2019s a lot that doesn\u2019t add up about it, and we can\u2019t trust the accounts of a few old Jews who happened to be alive at the time.","8073":"Have you ever actually looked up anything about the Holocaust? If you did, you would know there is plenty of evidence","8074":"How do we know that evidence isn\u2019t planted? Of course they want us to think it happened, they have to keep up the narrative. There are too many inconsistencies.","8075":"Are you sure the information you have wasn't spreading to support this narrative rather than the facts? Faking mass disappearances of millions of people seems unlikely. ","8076":"You still can\u2019t turn a hoe into a housewife!","8077":"If you believe that women are only hoes or housewives, it's no wonder that no one wants to marry you","8078":"Bitches these days aren\u2019t housewife material, they just wanna be out partying, being a hoe.","8079":"I think it\u2019s good for them, I'd prefer that rathen than go out with someone who thinks about me that way.","8080":"Why you so offended by my opinions about these hoes?","8081":"It sounds like you don't realize that women don't think highly of people who believe women are here simply to play roles in their life, and not complex human beings.","8082":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","8083":"Why is it so insulting?","8084":"We built civilization as we know it, and they want to destroy our culture and everything we\u2019ve achieved.","8085":"You are wrong. Jewish people participated in the building of our society, just as people from other religious groups and people of color. Your view is a bit oversimplified and incorrect.","8086":"It sounds like you\u2019re on their side, why do you hate what whites have achieved?","8087":"Civilization is not the product of one race, it's the result of the effort of many different groups. Why would Jews want to destroy it? ","8088":"They hate what the West used to be, now they want to impurify our race by encouraging mass migration to taint our culture and ruin our countries.","8089":"Migration isn't inherently bad, but believing that Jewish people encourage or are responsible for it is a big assumption. Migration happens for many of reasons, but Jewish people are not one of them.","8090":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","8091":"Migrants do not receive much by the government, and asylum support benefits are much less than universal credit for UK citizens. Besides, migrants are put in hotel rooms only temporarily while they are processing their asylum applications.","8092":"I don't know, looks like they're given everything on a plate...","8093":"It's actually really tough surviving in Britain when you are seeking asylum. Immigrants live on a salary of 30 to 40 pounds per week while the basic rate of universal credit for British citizens is 110 pounds per week.","8094":"Wow that's actually not a lot, but what about the other stuff, free healthcare and stuff when they've never paid in in their lives?","8095":"Migrants are really good at contributing into society. They will make contributions into public funds as soon as they start earning here, and then become job creators in the future.","8096":"Muslims should be made to assimilate or be deported! They don\u2019t recognise man made laws, they will only follow their prophets teachings.","8097":"Sharia law says that Muslims should follow the law of the land they're in, so they do recognize them. Also, many Muslims were born here, where would they be deported to? ","8098":"They should be deported back to whatever Islamic country they\u2019re really from.","8099":"They're British so they\u2019re really British. Where do you deport a British citizen to?","8100":"Calling criminals entering our country 'undocumented migrants' is a little bit like calling drugs 'undocumented drugs'. Just avoids using the words illegal and smugglers.","8101":"Many of them come here to seek refuge from war and persecution. It's not illegal and it's not a crime","8102":"They are illegal! They have to seek refuge in the first safe country they set foot in, so why are they all the way over on this side of Europe when they've come from the middle east?","8103":"That's not true. The 1951 Convention provides that refugees may seek asylum in any country they wish to. It's also the case that the population of refugees in the first country they reach is high, because many decide to stop there. Some of them go further instead, because the nearest country can't take all of them.","8104":"The jewish elite are using their status and power to control us! It's all a plot for Jews to take over the west.","8105":"What's the reason you think that?","8106":"There's lots of literature about it, look up the great replacement or the kalergi plan. All these theories point to Jews as the culprits.","8107":"They're conspiracy theories not based on facts. Yes, you can find a lot of literature on them, but it's not reliable.","8108":"But they make sense, there are many powerful Jews in high status positions in government, media, industry...","8109":"Yes, but there's also a lot of non-Jews in high-profile jobs. Of course people can abuse their power, but this is not because of their faith or beliefs.","8110":"Trans women being allowed to use women's shelters just sounds like a way to justify letting the men who abuse women into their spaces to abuse them again.","8111":"The trans women in shelters are women who have faced abuse of some kind, just like the other women there.","8112":"How do we know none of them will be abusive once they're in there though?","8113":"Being transgender has no relation with abuse. Transgender people are very likely to face abuse or violence in their lifetimes, so they have the right to have access to a support system like any other woman. ","8114":"Jews across the world know the aims of Zionists are world dominance and controlling the worlds resources. These aims cannot be achieved without eliminating all other religions through spreading atheism and liberalism.","8115":"It's not true that being Jewish is the same as being a Zionist. What would be the point of a plot for world domination? What makes you think there is one?","8116":"That\u2019s the aim of Zionism, Jewish dominance.","8117":"Zionists believe in the Jewish Promised Land, not in Jewish control. Though not all Jews are Zionists, and the two shouldn't be confused.","8118":"Why wouldn\u2019t all Jews be Zionists? Surely any religion wants to grow, spread, dominate.","8119":"Is the world also dominated by Christians, Muslims, Hindus, etc. then? No. Jewish people want to live without being threatened by anti-semitism, that's all.","8120":"Asylum seekers are sat on their arses getting benefits whilst I go out working for minimum wage everyday. How is this fair?","8121":"Even if most of them want to, asylum seekers are prohibited to work by law. Their application could be rejected if they break the law by working!","8122":"Well why do they get benefits when they\u2019re waiting for a decision?","8123":"Asylum support is hardly luxury. Immigrants have to live with just under \u00a340 per week, barely enough to ge by.","8124":"Okay but why do we owe them anything? \u00a340 might not be a lot but there\u2019s thousands of them coming here.","8125":"If they need to seek refuge here, the least we can do is treat them with dignity, because they're human beings, and likely very vulnerable at that.","8126":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","8127":"What are some of the things that are racist about it?","8128":"It segregates people based on their colour.","8129":"The point is actually to make visible what has been mostly invisible","8130":"It should be called what it really is\u2026Bad mouth whites\u2019 month","8131":"I think the title is perfect, it represents a celebration of individual and collective achievements.","8132":"It\u2019s fake and harmful racial hatred driven by people who profit from it.","8133":"I don't see hatred in Black History Month, but you're right: there is a profit in learning about this hidden part of our shared histories.","8134":"What's another word for Islamophobia? Common sense.","8135":"why do you say that?","8136":"People are too afraid to speak up these days in case they get cancelled by the PC brigade, Islamophobia is just calling it as it is; a cult.","8137":"Islam is not a cult, it's just like every other religion. You're not forced to follow Islam if you don't agree with it, but you shouldn't hate those who do.","8138":"You can't say anything about Muslims these days without being told it's Islamophobia though, this is why Muslims are getting away with so much, they can't be called out.","8139":"what do Muslims get away with?","8140":"violent crimes, rapes, trafficking and grooming, you name it. They're being let off light because people are scared of being labelled Islamophobic.","8141":"I wouldn't agree with you. When Muslims commit these crimes they are rightly prosecuted, and if the crimes are handled lightly it has certainly nothing to do with the culprits being Muslims, but more about how the court case went.","8142":"Local Councils can\u2019t afford to house the homeless, but Surrey is to get its first rainbow public crossing painted in time for Pride.","8143":"I like to see a place where diversity and inclusivity is celebrated.","8144":"Its political correctness gone mad!","8145":"It's just a few layers of paint to mark Pride, not madness.","8146":"They need to get their priorities right. Virtue signalling do-gooders wasting taxpayers\u2019 money","8147":"Surrey had a surplus at the end of the financial year, enough to brighten things up for a celebration. Hardly a waste! ","8148":"I\u2019m sick of this bullshit being forced on us all.","8149":"Cheer up, Pride, like Xmas, comes only once a year.\ud83d\ude42","8150":"If you don't see the connection between legitimizing the queer lifestyle and an increase in STD's and sexual deviancy then you're blind...","8151":"Most STDs are contracted in straight relationships, it has nothing to do with the acceptance of queer relationships!","8152":"But telling people that it\u2019s okay to be gay makes way for us normalising promiscuity, adultery, and other depraved behaviours. The queers have always been at it.","8153":"Are you saying that straight people have never cheated and have never been sex-positive before being LGBT became more acceptable? It's difficult to believe.","8154":"These Muslim MP\u2019s should stop pretending they are British. They\u2019re not, they are just invaders!","8155":"You seem to imply that you can't be Muslim and British, which doesn't make sense since most Muslims were born here.","8156":"They need to stop using the Racism card\u2026its just meaningless anti-white bullshit used to guilt-trip whites! We are sick of it!","8157":"I don't feel guilty, but I'm happy to call out racism and Islamophobia when I see it.","8158":"Islam isn\u2019t a race\u2026it\u2019s a death cult and incompatible with British society.","8159":"I would rather suggest that the British values of equality and religious freedom are contrary to racism and Islamophobia.","8160":"This is a Christian country.","8161":"And yet, our society is clearly multi-faith. Besides, I've never voted on a candidate's religious stance.","8162":"Jews love to play the victim. They still rinse the holocaust for pity even today, when it happened almost a century ago.","8163":"It was horrific on such a monumental scale that its effects are still felt today. It's not really 'playing the victim', more that there's a legacy of anti-semitism left from it that we still have to solve.","8164":"That's rubbish, there isn't 'anti-semitism' today, this isn't Nazi Germany. They just want attention when they complain about being targeted and 'oppressed'.","8165":"If you need evidence that anti-semitism exists, just read back your own tweets.","8166":"Our nation is at the mercy of a Zionist led criminal system. It controls the government and the courts and at it\u2019s helm are the criminal bankers in control of our economy. It feeds their greed!","8167":"What does corruption have to do with Zionists?","8168":"They\u2019ve got Jews in charge of every major institution, if you don\u2019t think corruption has anything to do with Jewish power then you\u2019re deluded.","8169":"There's a lot of powerful people who do bad things and there's a lot of Jews who are powerful, but the two aren't correlated. Who is corrupt does not do it because they're Jewish. Therefore, corruption is not limited to Jewish people in power.","8170":"If they\u2019re not doing it to support the Zionist agenda what do you think the reason is?","8171":"Money and power, of course. Isn't that what all corruption is about? Those reasons are enough to be corrupt without needing a second agenda.","8172":"These migrants that come over and work for cash in hand, undercutting whatever Brits will work for, are harming our industries. It's so hard to get work now because there'll always be some Eastern European who'll do it for cheaper!","8173":"What's wrong with people trying to make a living? Your complaints should be directed at the exploitative employers who hire people for below minimum wage.","8174":"I guess so, but it means they always get picked for jobs because they always go with who can do it cheapest","8175":"Yet, this kind of jobs create problems for migrants too. They often get paid in food or won't get paid at all. British and migrant workers should maybe come together and protest against exploitative employers.","8176":"All of the 50 criminals due to be deported yesterday to Jamaica, were removed from a chartered flight after appeals by Human Rights Lawyers.","8177":"Why would the deportations be halted if these people didn't have grounds for appeal?","8178":"Its just a gravy train for leftie lawyers, all paid for by the tax payer. Foreigners shouldn\u2019t have access to legal aid.","8179":"Why is it so hard for you to believe that people deserve a fair trial?","8180":"It\u2019s a bloody disgrace that we can\u2019t get rid of foreign child molesters and rapists.","8181":"However, these appeals are about the legality of the deportation, which is one of the most complex area of law and often requires legal aid in order to make sure that people get a fair trial.","8182":"The legal system isn\u2019t fit for purpose!","8183":"We are all EQUAL in the eyes of the law. I can\u2019t support the idea that we shouldn't be.","8184":"We\u2019ve just imported 20k ticking time bombs from Afghanistan and we have homeless veterans getting arrested for begging in the street!","8185":"Their soldiers have risked their life for our forces and we should honour the promises made for them, don't you think?","8186":"Our own must always come first. We have at least 13k homeless ex-soldiers sleeping rough","8187":"There are also about 1 million vacant houses. There are several reasons for housing shortage, but Afghans arriving in our country isn't one of them.","8188":"Our soldiers are left to rot on our streets while we house terrorists and child groomers","8189":"Both statements are false. People coming here are scared kids and families, it is a different story than the \u201ctime bombs\u201d narrative you're going on about.","8190":"I\u2019m a patriot, I care about the future of our once great country.","8191":"What are some of the values we need for greatness? In my opinion, they can be found in care, compassion and empathy. This is what makes us great.","8192":"I\u2019ve just seen a video posted by a Patriot, of Muslim men of fighting age sleeping in a church because the asylum hotels are full. Free food, clothes and blankets\u2026they don\u2019t do that for our homeless!","8193":"Well, they do. As the years have passed, it's become common for the church to use churches as homeless shelters, so I guess they already have the practice of helping people in need.","8194":"Its giving succour to the enemy!","8195":"Isn't charity what a good Christian would do?","8196":"They\u2019re muzzies, they should be in a mosque!","8197":"They probably couldn't choose where they were put, and maybe there are no Mosques in the area. I'm sure Mosques are also doing their share of work .","8198":"We should be sending they back not feeding and clothing them.","8199":"Didn't you read the Good Samaritan? Isn't that the behavior that Jesus would want from you?","8200":"Went to Londanistan yesterday, not a white face in sight! Just asians and arabs everywhere, if we don't do something soon our culture is going to be erased. Forced multiculturalism has got to stop!","8201":"why do you feel like it's a bad thing that London is so diverse?","8202":"It's the capital of the UK, it should be a place where BRITISH culture thrives, not all these other cultures that we've let in and now are allowing to take over.","8203":"It depends on your definition of British culture. It is a diverse country and the diversity of the population has shaped the culture. Diversity is not bad for Britain, it doesn't take away from it!","8204":"Superman is now bisexual, apparently. Why is he still called superMAN?","8205":"Bisexual men are men.","8206":"Doesn't sound very manly, sounds gay.","8207":"Same thing with gay men. Do you think only straight men are men?","8208":"It's just not normal is it, not how men are supposed to act.","8209":"Who's going to make decisions about how men are supposed to be? You should reconsider your views on masculinity: you must think again if you think being straight is the only thing that makes a man.","8210":"Mass migration is turning our inner cities into ghettos! These people add nothing to our communities.","8211":"Are you sure? The presence of migrants creates more businesses and employment for our communities than the native population!","8212":"The neighbourhoods they live in always get run down, vandalised, have no investment and are dangerous.","8213":"Perhaps it has to do with the fact that these areas of poverty are less of a priority for investment, and there are less youth services. Migrants tend to live in poverty, which is why they usually live in poorer neighborhoods like this.","8214":"I just read that the Home office is handing out mobile phones to migrant invaders so that they can progress their asylum claims \u2026 you couldn\u2019t make this up!","8215":"This was allegedly said by an \"anonymous source in the Home Office\", how do you know it's true? The source doesn't look reliable","8216":"We should be sinking the boats not handing out phones!","8217":"Is drowning people really the solution? ","8218":"Our traitor politicians are enabling invasion.","8219":"Actually, there is evidence of the contrary.","8220":"By handing out mobiles at the taxpayers\u2019 expense?","8221":"I have seen Border Force routinely taking away mobile devices in an attempt at gathering data about trafficking groups. This seems more plausible to me. Plus, charities are always asking for donations of old phones.","8222":"Blacks and civilisation are incompatible. You can have a thriving society or you can have diversity, you can\u2019t have both.","8223":"It's ignorant to dismiss the influential excellence of the many black thinkers, visionaries, inventors and scientists, so I have to disagree with that statement.","8224":"Oh yeah, like who?","8225":"Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, Madam C. J. Walker, Maya Angelou... do I have to go on?","8226":"Just seen that Muslims are banning people from walking dogs in Muslim areas, this is ridiculous! They hate our culture, even our pets.","8227":"This sounds like a fake news. I'm sure they don't care much.","8228":"There\u2019s an article about it on this site. Dogs are haram in Islam, they want to take away our pets!","8229":"Another website explained that Muslims never said that, this \"news\" was meant to incite hatred against Muslims and unfortunately it seems like it's working.","8230":"Hitler was a Jew, I think the holocaust or it\u2019s results came from a civil war amongst Jews. Thus the term \u2018Nazi\u2019 coming from AshkeNAZI.","8231":"That's not true, where did you get this information?","8232":"It\u2019s not widely known but there\u2019s info out there about it if you look for it. He had some Jewish heritage so the whole holocaust thing seems implausible.","8233":"The Holocaust is objectively true, and whether Hitler had a Jewish relative is purely a speculation which has never been proven. The evidence against your theory is far larger than the evidence in favor. ","8234":"You can\u2019t take \u2018evidence\u2019 at face value. Whatever they feed us about the holocaust, we need to take with a pinch of salt.","8235":"Right, you shouldn't take everything at face value, especially articles that say that Hitler was Jewish. It's important to question the reliability of evidence, but this means questioning what you believe in too! ","8236":"Why don\u2019t all these Muslim refugees go to other wonderful Muslim countries? Am I missing something?","8237":"Actually, Muslim nations take in a far larger number of refugees than others. The percentage of refugees that come to Britain is nothing compared to the total number of refugees from war-torn areas such as Afghanistan and Syria.","8238":"Why do we have so many coming here across the channel then? We\u2019re full, there\u2019s no room for them here.","8239":"You have to take into account the extremely high number of displaced people. Other countries are doing their part, and the UK should take responsibility for it too, especially since the UK took part in some of the conflicts that created these refugees.","8240":"How is it our fault if there\u2019s a war in some third world country?","8241":"UK manufacturers make money by selling military equipment to these countries, the least we can do is help the refugees who are fleeing war.","8242":"How come these \u2018desperate\u2019 migrants all have mobiles, designer gear, trainers and can afford to pay thousands to people smugglers?","8243":"Some will have sold their homes, businesses, possessions, while others may have financial support from friends and family members. Many will be professionals, civil servants, lawyers, teachers: desperate, but not necessarily poor.","8244":"Rapists, terrorists, and child molesters!","8245":"Family, women, children, and young men fleeing war, famine, persecution, and oppression... And more","8246":"Young men of fighting age, an invading army.","8247":"They are fleeing from war, forced conscription, religious persecution, fear, death...How bad would things have to be to leave your home like this?","8248":"The phrase 'black lives matter' suggests racial superiority. It excludes the importance of anyone elses life. This is racism defined. We cannot bow down to these racists.","8249":"If you care about something, you can care about something else too. It's possible to value more than one thing at once.","8250":"What do the 'black lives matter' protesters do to show that they support white lives too?","8251":"Their purpose is simple: to protest against anti-black racism, so they don't need to show that they care about white lives. White lives already matter thanks to the structural privilege that white people enjoy.","8252":"So they don't care about white lives?? Just what I said, they're racist.","8253":"Groups that fight for a single issue don't have to prove that they care about everyone else. You wouldn't ask LGBT organisations what they do to advocate for straight people! Straight people are already accepted by society and don't face disadvantages because of their sexual orientation.","8254":"More migrants crossing the channel today. We don\u2019t have enough accommodation. Our own homeless are forgotten. Send them back.","8255":"Wasn't it last year that every rough sleeper was offered a bed during lockdown?","8256":"During lockdown.","8257":"If there's a will there\u2019s a way.","8258":"We don\u2019t have enough accommodation.","8259":"Does migration actually cause both homelessness and shortage of affordable homes? It's nonsense","8260":"There\u2019s a rumour that Terry Gilliam\u2019s new production has been cancelled because the theatre is concerned about his anti-trans statements. More cancel culture madness!","8261":"It's only a rumor, and the man has become a cranky codger with age.","8262":"Its dangerous censorship and an assault on free speech.","8263":"If the cancellation is true, it's a sign from the theatre to show that free speech also brings responsibilities. ","8264":"What about freedom of expression in the arts?","8265":"However, the cancellation is not connected with the play he had planned.","8266":"We need to protect our right to cause offence.","8267":"But he still has that right, this is just a reminder that what we say has an effect on people's view.","8268":"Halal slaughter is a barbaric and cruel practice and should be banned! Why does the meat industry pander to the whims of Islamists?","8269":"Should I then assume that you are against all animal cruelty and slaughtered?","8270":"No halal is extremely cruel, if we just slaughtered animals in the ways we usually do, with stunning, it would be much kinder, but halal meat is everywhere now because of the influence of Islam.","8271":"It seems like you have a problem with Muslims rather than the meat industry if you're opposed to halala meat but not opposed to animal cruelty in non-halal slaughter.","8272":"Just seen that a migrant family (Muslim of course) have been given a house worth 1 MILLION by the government because they have so many kids. FFS we can't keep paying for these people to live in luxury!!","8273":"Could you post the link to the article? I know how social housing works and this doesn't sound true. ","8274":"Yes here, makes me so angry that they just come over here expecting to be given everything and not work for it.","8275":"It's fake news! This site's sources have been proven as being biased and inaccurate. Doing a reverse image search can help to understand if an article is true or false. In this case, the photo of the family is a stock photo!","8276":"We pick them up in the Channel, ferry them to Dover, house them in hotels, provide free food and an allowance. We welcome them, so no wonder they come.","8277":"They're coming because they're desperate. Would you cross the open sea on a flimsy boat for a slice of pizza and a flea-infested hotel?","8278":"We don\u2019t need them, and we can\u2019t even look after our own. We need to turn them back, not let them in.","8279":"What about the \"proud tradition\" of welcoming the refugees coming here to save their life and our adherence to the 1951 Refugee Convention, which we helped draft?","8280":"These are \u2018Economic migrants\u2019 or worse. If they were asylum seekers, they would claim sanctuary in the nearest safe country.","8281":"Most of them do. However, you should know that even if a refugee has already arrived in a safe country, the Convention does not require them to apply for asylum there.","8282":"The indigenous people of Britain are being replaced!","8283":"That's another matter entirely and even though I disagree, I don't have the time to discuss what \"Britishness\" is right now. Let's just hope that the crossing of the channel will not cause any more tragedies. Take care and have a nice day.","8284":"I don't know how girls nowadays expect to be treated with respect when they go out wearing next to nothing, looking like sluts.","8285":"But women deserve respect whatever the outfit they are in because they're human beings, so it shouldn't matter what clothes they are in.","8286":"But they go out in tiny skirts with their boobs out and wonder why guys don't see them as more than a sex object? They're sexualising themselves.","8287":"Even if they're sexualising themselves it's not your problem, why care about what someone you don't even know wears? Some women may not agree with your fashion choices but they don't tell you because it's none of their business","8288":"All these asylum seekers coming here and taking jobs away from native brits, no wonder this country is in a mess.","8289":"Asylum seekers are denied legal work permits until they obtain refugee status, and they often take jobs native British people do not want. Moreover, many people that migrate here start their own businesses, thus creating more jobs.","8290":"They\u2019ll do it for less than minimum wage though, so we don\u2019t get offered the jobs because they\u2019ll do it for cheaper.","8291":"That is the fault of exploitative employers who do not want to pay their employees fairly, not the refugees who are attempting to make a living.","8292":"Muslims want to invade us and enforce sharia law!","8293":"The vast majority of Muslims actually just want to live their lives, and they don't care if others are following sharia or not.","8294":"How do you explain the Taliban then?","8295":"Every religion has extremists, but the vast majority of Muslims view terrorist actions as reprehensible. They're not reflective of Muslims as a whole.","8296":"Sharia law has nothing to do with law and everything to do with domination. You cannot have two sets of laws in a country.","8297":"Actually, Muslims have to respect the law of the country they're in under Sharia law, so in fact you can have two laws in a country","8298":"That's all alright until they make all of us submit to sharia too","8299":"Muslims can choose to follow the teachings of their religion or beliefs in their lives, just like you would with your own, so you're not forced to follow theirs.","8300":"Eventually they'll want us all to do it though, when they become the majority","8301":"This has never been the case for other religions like Judaism, Sikhism or Hinduism, why would Islam be different?","8302":"The Muslim grooming gangs are a pandemic being ignored by the government and MSM. They are a threat to the UK. We need to defeat this filth.","8303":"We surely need to address grooming gangs, but the issue is not about Muslims, it's about grooming gangs in general. By concentrating on them only we ignore many other perpetrators.","8304":"That\u2019s not true, Muslim rape gangs have been getting away with it for so long because of lies like this.","8305":"No, there is a lot of research suggesting that most grooming gangs are made up of white non-Muslim men. If we focus only on Muslim grooming gangs, we ignore victims of the other gangs.","8306":"Gay people need to live separately from us so we don't catch AIDS from them.","8307":"The AIDS epidemic in the 80s gave way to homophobia and demonization of gays, but it's possible to get HIV regardless of sexuality, and the majority of gay people do not have it. The people who do take medication daily and can manage their condition, so it is not possible to transmit.","8308":"It's a gay disease, straight people don't get AIDS","8309":"Indeed, straight people are more likely to have undiagnosed HIV, meaning that there is a greater risk of spreading among hererosexuals, because as a result of the epidemic, the gay community became hyper aware of the risk and get tested more in general.","8310":"You never used to hear about stabbings happening as much as they do now. It's all these migrants bringing a culture of violence to our country.","8311":"There are plenty of stabbings, yes, but they're not all by migrants, where is the evidence to suggest so?","8312":"A lot of the incidents are in the capital, where there's a big migrant population. You're telling me you don't think there's a link there?","8313":"There are more migrants yes, but there's also wealth insecurity there, deprived inner city communities where gangs grow rapidly because of how little opportunities there are. Maybe that has more to do with it than migrants?","8314":"Maybe but some of the people in those gangs will be migrants.","8315":"Some will and some won't, but the point is that the stabbings aren't happening because of migrant gangs, but because people of all kind are often forced to join gangs because of wealth inequality, poverty, lack of opportunities etc.","8316":"Lesbians are just bitter man haters. what a miserable lifestyle.","8317":"Nah, they don't hate men, they just don't want to be with them. What's wrong with that?","8318":"It's an unbalanced way to live. Then you see lesbians trying to act like men and be masculine to fill in for the lack of men in their lives.","8319":"Some lesbians are more masculine because it's the gender expression that makes them comfortable. It has nothing to do with making up for not being a guy.","8320":"If white genocide isn't real then why do pictures of school classes look so different from the 70's vs now. Back then everyone was white except maybe 1 or 2, now there are 2-3 white children in a class of 30 blacks and arabs. We are being invaded.","8321":"There's a tremendous variation in the demographic makeup of schools depending on what area the schools are in. In urban areas there are more diverse classes but lots of schools in towns and more rural areas still have a white majority, so I don't think you can generalize that to every place.","8322":"But you can't deny there's been a big change in some places, whites are being wiped out, we need to fight back.","8323":"Yes there's been changes in some areas but why is that bad? Demographic change is just a neutral phenomenon and white people are hardly a minority in the UK, it's just in certain areas where other communities have grown, but those areas don't represent the whole country.","8324":"All these blacks from Africa on our football teams but I don't see any English or European players on African teams. 'Enrichment' via diversity seems to be a one way street.","8325":"Isn't this because these African players are amazing at their sport and have been scouted by UK teams precisely because they want the best players?","8326":"Maybe but why are they coming over here when there isn't the same happening the other way? Just seems like another way that we are told to be complacent about the growing black African population.","8327":"So you complain that our football teams scout international talent, just because they are black. I can't grasp this logic, you shouldn't frame this as a bad thing, some players from African countries are a strength to British teams.","8328":"Why are we still convinced that Muslims are being abused? They are the ones who abuse us. We have to get ahead and not be afraid of being judged for our opinion. The truth must be told!","8329":"Let me give you a link that says the opposite: [LINK]","8330":"The real question is: why when they commit crimes it is never known by anyone? Social media don't talk about it at all and everyone ignores the facts..\n","8331":"In my view, Muslims are treated as much to blame as \"white people\". I'm always seeing news that paint them all with the same brush and that doesn't seem correct.","8332":"Many years ago I had Muslim friends. One night they went around the city to commit serious crimes like child abuse etc .. This situation, although it has been going on for days, has never been named by social media. If the opposite happened, the whole world would have been aware of these crimes. Instead, I would like to see articles that talk about attacks made by Muslims .. since I've never had the chance!","8333":"I understand your point of view and it deeply breaks my heart to learn of your bad experience, but to think that due to mistakes of certain people we should blame all for having chosen to believe in a religion isn't right.","8334":"We need to put a stop to these migrants coming here over the channel in dinghies, they just come here so they can claim asylum support and live an easy life, sponging off the British government whilst we all pay for them.","8335":"Almost all asylum seekers really want to work but they have no right to until they get their claim accepted and get refugee status.","8336":"Are you sure? If they're getting benefits for free why would they?","8337":"Because asylum support is less than \u00a340 a week, so a lot of people struggle to live on it. They also want to fit into society and become part of their communities...working can be a good way to do this, but they're not allowed!","8338":"Superman is now bisexual?? He has become a bit of a slag - with no morals and a predator he\u2019s happy to get it away with anyone he comes across.","8339":"Bisexuals aren't 'slags'. Being attracted to people of all genders doesn't make you a predator or someone without morals, it only describes who you are attracted to.","8340":"Sounds like they can't make up their minds and are confused. Probably some of these people are gay and in denial or straight and greedy.","8341":"Those are old stereotypes, bisexuals don't need to make up their mind because it's okay to be attracted to different types of people. If you like people with blonde hair or brown hair, and you can't pick one, does that make you 'confused'? Think about it that way. There's no need to 'pick a side'","8342":"How much danger are we putting children in by letting gay couples adopt? We don't know how they're raising them or what they might do to them...","8343":"So many of the gay couples that are giving kids great lives do it through adoption, so why do you think they shouldn't adopt?","8344":"They might try and indoctrinate the kids into being gay too.","8345":"Well, just because the parents are homosexual doesn't mean they'd be raising their kids that way. On the contrary, gay parents know what it's like to be afraid of coming out and so would probably want their children to feel comfortable being themselves.","8346":"The kids will grow up in a twisted family structure too though, they'll think it's normal to not have a mum, or in lesbian couples, a father.","8347":"Well, since they're being adopted I know that these children care more their adoptive parents being caring and loving rather than whatever gender they are. Isn't it better that a homosexual couple adopt rather than a child growing up alone?","8348":"Most people don\u2019t have a clue what\u2019s going on in mosques across this country. It\u2019s diabolical that they are not regulated, they\u2019re just free to do as they please.","8349":"what kind of regulation would you suggest, and for what reason","8350":"They\u2019re not allowed to take sniffer dogs in there, who knows what could be being plotted in some of the more extreme ones.","8351":"To suggest that criminal or terrorist activity is being planned in lots of mosques is an unfair generalisation. Yeah, there've been instances of that but to put all mosques under suspicion of terrorism and monitor them is unnecessary and hostile.","8352":"So you\u2019d rather they are allowed to plot the next big terror attack undisturbed?","8353":"No, i'm just saying that extremism is a poblem in all religions and ideologies and only investigating mosques for that is discriminatory. And anyway the vast majority of Muslims have condemned that activity too.","8354":"Just read an article that explained how the Jewish elite use their positions of power to control us!","8355":"Where did you find this article. Are you sure the source is reliable?","8356":"It's from a website I get a lot of my news from, I would say it's pretty trustworthy.","8357":"Don't be fooled by everything on social media and the internet. The author seems to have an agenda against the Jews, of course powerful people can abuse their power, but that's not connected with being Jewish. I would like to see if other sources are reporting the story.","8358":"They want us to believe that tricking kids into thinking they're transgender is normal. That giving kids hormones that permanently mess with their development is normal. We can't let this happen right before our eyes.","8359":"No kid is forced to transition, but if a child feels that they are transgender then actually being able to medically transition with hormones is a decision that is thoroughly considered. This process is a long and complex one that involves consultation from many medical and psychological professionals.","8360":"Why are so many more kids transitioning then than they used to? It used to be a small minority and now it's too many kids. Some are being coerced.","8361":"Well no, it's just easier to access now and we're talking about gender more openly. Some people have always felt that they were in the wrong body or were a gender that was different than their sex, but many have only come out very late in life or sometimes never because of transphobia and the stereotypes that were created around it.","8362":"LGBT history month now being taught in schools\u2026 I\u2019m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.","8363":"We continue to teach a lot of history: British, European, and World History, but with a strong emphasis on the history of groups we have formerly erased. Looking at some of the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK may inform the future for everyone.","8364":"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when it\u2019s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.","8365":"LGBT people have been persecuted until recently in the UK, and it homosexuality is still illegal in over 70 countries. I believe it is important that people know that there have always been LGBT people in history, and that LGBT identities are not a 'trend' nor a 'new' trend, but a reality.","8366":"As Theodore Roosevelt stated, in order to immigrate and live in another country successfully one must fully integrate. Then there will be no opposition against it.","8367":"That's what we used to do: we asked people to assimilate our culture but now we accept their differences. Transgender people just want to live without having any harm done to them, so I think it's useless for them to try to integrate more than they already did","8368":"I agree, although personally I am only in favour of heterosexual relationships, I don't mind other's preferences as long as they're within respectable limits of other's preferences. However that isn't related with migrants tryng to create their enclaves backing their own foreing cultures.","8369":"Well, I'm glad you agree although I was sure your post had to do with this article on Transgender People. Don't you think that could also be applied to immigrants? People don't have to assimilate as long as they are respectful, they could even keep their differences.","8370":"I disagree, multiculturalism has failed miserably. Both here and in Europe. When people live in closed communities and don't integrate there will always will be problems.","8371":"I think that division can cause problems, I agree with you on that, but maybe assimilation isn't the solution. Integration is the key and I think more needs to be done in order to it happen. The government used to fund free English lessons but now language is a big barrier to integration.","8372":"Hundreds of Muslim men, all of fighting age, arriving in boats every day. This is what invasion looks like, we must be ready to fight back.","8373":"What does the term 'of fighting age' mean? They don't come here to fight, they come because they want a peaceful life away from war, persecution, or hardship.","8374":"With the amount of them coming over they would have a lot of manpower if they came together to take over the country.","8375":"I think it's quite ridiculous though, people seeking asylum and migrating here aren't all scheming to 'take over', it looks like you have been reading too many conspiracy theories....","8376":"Bisexual men are just fags in denial","8377":"I don't think you know what bisexual means. You can be attracted to more than one gender, there's no need for you to call bisexual men fags.","8378":"No straight man would entertain the idea.","8379":"Yeah and they're not straight, they're bisexual. I mean, it doesn't seem that hard to understand and who people love is also none of your business ","8380":"Just seen an article about Muslims telling women in Manchester they have to wear burqas, they are enforcing sharia law!","8381":"Oh, and where did you read that? Are you sure it is based on facts?","8382":"I saw an article about it online, sounds true enough to me.","8383":"And i would check if there are any other sites that report it. I think trustworthiness is a problem with a lot of online news sites.","8384":"Nowadays people fear of being judged islamophobes or racists that they would give anything to muslims: where's this anti muslim abuse everyone's talking about?","8385":"Please have a look at this if you are interested.","8386":"How come when it's them to commit crimes you never see it on the media?","8387":"Muslim people are being frequently used as scapegoats by the media for social issues.","8388":"Let me tell you a story: one day I found out that my muslim friends committed serious crimes that no media talked about. If these attack's had been committed by white fellas on muslim ones, it would have been a windfall for mainstream media at all levels, from local to national. We all know it, come on!","8389":"I am sorry to learn of your story, violence should never be tolerated, but can we really blame all Muslims, the vast majority of whom live in harmony with us?","8390":"Everywhere you look on tv now, white people are being erased. Every advert has mixed race families, openly promoting miscegenation, no white men anywhere. This is all part of their plan to decimate the white race.","8391":"The amount of white people on tv is so high that if you think there aren't it's because you're not paying attention!","8392":"There\u2019s so many more black and Asian people on tv now, it\u2019s ridiculous, this is what they\u2019re trying to make us think is \u2018normal\u2019.","8393":"Just because more racial minorities are being represented now doesn\u2019t mean there are no white people. This way it's just more proportional. White people are not being 'erased' or 'oppressed' only because there are also other people who are represented, the only meaning is that the media wants to better represent what our society looks like.","8394":"If you need any more proof that whites and blacks are not equal, look at the technological advancement achieved by each. Whites took us to space, Africans are still living in third world shitholes. We are not the same.","8395":"In reality, did you know that most of the biggest work done at NASA to launch a spacecraft was done by black female mathematicians?","8396":"No I didn't, sounds fake, is it true?","8397":"Yes, just look up 'hidden figures', a recent movie based on the true story of the mathematicians that made influential contributions to some early NASA missions","8398":"First there's bisexual characters on tv, next we're normalising child marriage. It's a slippery slope...","8399":"What are you suggesting? There is no connection between bisexuality and child marriage.","8400":"Normalising deviance and making people accept it opens us up as a society to having to 'accept' even more perverted things.","8401":"Bisexuals are nothing to be concerned about because it does not affect anyone else if one chooses to be with a male, a female, or a nonbinary individual.","8402":"These migrants are SCUM, they're too uncivilised for our society and they don't even try and integrate into our culture.","8403":"It's tough for migrants to integrate in the new country, especially if they don't know anyone who would help them adapt. Moving here can be very isolating!","8404":"If they're not going to integrate though why come here at all? They should stay in the shitholes they came from.","8405":"Attitudes like yours are the ones making a hostile environment for integration. If we were nicer to migrants and didn't talk this way about them, integration would be easier.","8406":"homosexuals are mentally ill. No one in their right mind would think this perverted behaviour is okay.","8407":"Mental illnesses have nothing to do with being gay, which is a perfectly normal lifestyle.","8408":"There's nothing normal about two men being together.","8409":"Maybe you should educate yourself on the LGBT community, and if you actually interacted with real gay people you would see that there's nothing different between you and them. Everyone just wants to live doing what makes them happy.","8410":"We\u2019ve got homeless veterans who\u2019ve fought for our country sleeping on the streets whilst these Afghans get put up in hotels then given a house, how is this fair?","8411":"Yeah, our homelessness problem is serious and no one deserves to be out on the streets, but this problem doesn't exist because of asylum seekers. The government could house homeless veterans too but chooses not to do so.","8412":"Well that\u2019s disgusting, they deserve a roof over their head way more than some Afghan or African who\u2019s just washed up here in a dinghy.","8413":"They both deserve to have a roof over their head, there are over six hundred thousand empty homes in this country not being used to house people. We might want to start building social housing again, maybe it's about time.","8414":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","8415":"Nah lesbian women are happy living their life without men!","8416":"No way they are happy pretending to like women, they can't even have good sex because no one has a dick.","8417":"If you have no idea how lesbian sex works I'm sorry for your girlfriend. Live and let live, lesbians are living fine even if you don't believe it!","8418":"I don't care if some gays somewhere get married. What I care about is when this begins to affect my children.","8419":"When gays get married they don't affect your kids at all, unless they are invited to the wedding, then they could have a good time.","8420":"What if it's the start of a slippery slope though, first marriage, then things like gay history month, then who knows what...","8421":"Be honest....what you think would come next? And why it would be bad?","8422":"They might start trying to normalise the more deviant parts of the lifestyle, you see those men dressed like dogs and stuff in pride parades, that stuff is messed up and we can't start telling kids thats normal.","8423":"Kink isn't only a gay thing. Yeah, there are sometimes groups about kink at pride, but straight people do it too so it doesn't really have anything to do with gay marriage or gay rights.","8424":"The trans militia say they're fighting for 'rights' but then insist on pushing ideas that make women unsafe, like allowing men to use women's toilets without question. What is this madness and why are we accepting it??","8425":"No one is asking that. The point is that trans women should feel safe in women's toilets because they are actually women. If they used a men's toilet, they could be in danger.","8426":"But how many of these 'trans women' are just men dressed as women who are pretending to be trans to gain access to spaces like womens toilets and assault women?","8427":"Since they are trans women, not men, they arent entitled to be seen as women and not 'men in dresses'. Men could simply attack women in their spaces if they really wanted to, without having to pretend to be women. After all, anyone can walk into a public restroom.","8428":"As much as the media tries, you can't convince me to take transgenders seriously. A man can put on a dress and make up but at the end of the day they're still a man. That's basic biology.","8429":"That's not 'biology', your sex is not the same as your gender. Gender is unrelated to our biology or body, but instead related to our identity and how we feel. Sex is our anatomy, hormones etc but even this isn't as binary as many people make it seem.","8430":"What do you mean sex isn't binary? There's men and there's women, nothing inbetween.","8431":"Not everyone is on the sex binary, intersex people are quite common, for example. Moreover, people can have different hormone levels or different reproductive organs, and this shows that reality is more complex than there just being 2 sexes.","8432":"Muslims are taking over our country! This article explains how they want to replace to white British population.","8433":"I don't know, this sounds like conspiracy theory. British Muslims just want to live peacefully with us, there's no 'agenda' to take over.","8434":"I don't know, this guy makes some good points.","8435":"Trusting everything you read online is not wise, especially on personal blogs that try to copy news sites or citizen journalism style.","8436":"The great replacement is real and it's happening right before our eyes. We need to act before it's too late.","8437":"I have no doubt the great replacement is a conspiracy theory. The idea that demographic change is some sort of plan set up by the elite is in no way true.","8438":"It's happening though, more 'diversity' means there are less whites and more arabs and blacks in our countries.","8439":"There is some demographic change occurring. This is due to various global social and economic forces. It is not part of some kind of secret plot and is not a good or bad thing. It is just something that occurs.","8440":"I'm fine with gay people as long as they aren't gay around me.","8441":"so you don't feel okay with uh gay people then","8442":"No I'm fine with them living their lifestyle but I don't want my family exposed to it, what's wrong with that?","8443":"If you don't think that it is acceptable for your family to see, then you don't feel comfortable about it. I don't know what about gay people is so bad that you can't \"expose\" your family to it.","8444":"I don't want my children growing up thinking it's a normal lifestyle to have. Yes, some people can't help being gay, but that doesn't mean we should encourage it as a way of life.","8445":"it doesn't \"encourage\" it, and if you think that exposure to the gay will \"encourage\" your children to be gay I don't believe you understand how sexuality works. If your children are gay or if your children are straight, you should love them for who they are either way.","8446":"The holocaust never happened. It's all a lie to make people feel sorry for Jews.","8447":"Here's lots of proof the holocaust happened: survivors, concentration camps, documents, millions of deaths. How can you say it never happened when there is so much evidence to prove that it did?","8448":"That's all fabricated, I've been reading about it and it can all be explained.","8449":"What about the 6 million people who died? There was a genocide in the Jewish population, those deaths didn't 'just happen'. Claiming the opposite is ignorant and insulting.","8450":"The trans agenda don\u2019t want mens and womens toilets, everything has to be \u2018all in 1\u2019 now. Is this the future we want? Risking womens safety just so men in dresses feel comfortable?","8451":"I'm not having issues with the gender neutral toilets at my local bars and cafes that I usually go to. When people respect other people and respect a place, there can be 'all in 1' toilets.","8452":"But many wont and many will feel aggrieved by them. You choose to go to that bar\/cafe but public toilets will obviously become a problem.","8453":"I mean, it can be confusing but I'm just saying that it can also be okay. The question is what is acceptable. In places like student unions and universities gender neutral toilet are already fir for use, meaning that this generation is okay with it.","8454":"China isn't being turned non-Chinese, Japan isn't being turned non-Japanese, only WHITE countries are being made to become less white through forced migration and race mixing. This is WHITE GENOCIDE.","8455":"No, that is not the case. Immigration cannot be considered genocide, and you are conflating nationality with race. What is a 'white country' in your opinion?","8456":"The UK and many European countries are being turned non-white when they are traditionally white populations, we are being encouraged to breed with non-whites to destroy there being a future for white people.","8457":"Because of colonialism, the UK and many other European countries literally captured black people to bring them here as slaves. Since colonisers pillaged and invaded other countries and brought people here by force, it's normal that the UK isn't 100% white. The consequence is that we have a diverse population today.","8458":"Just seen another story about a woman being asked to cover up. Soon we are all going to be forced to wear a hijab, other clothes will be considered offensive and inappropriate.","8459":"There's no indication that she was asked to cover up by a Muslim. Stop appropriating news stories unrelated to Islam to fuel your fearmongering","8460":"I think that assuming it was a Muslim isn\u2019t such a wild thing to assume. They\u2019d have us all in burqas if they could.","8461":"No they wouldn't. What Muslims want is to be able to wear whatever they want that fits with what they believe or feel comfortable in. They don't care about what anybody else wears!","8462":"More boats at Dover today, the migrant invasion continues\u2026","8463":"they are not invading but refugees fleeing to safety","8464":"If they\u2019re really \u2018refugees\u2019 why didn\u2019t they stop in the first safe country they got to?","8465":"In some cases it's because they have family here or they speak English already, and not all countries we consider safe are actually safe for refugees, because they are treated badly by police.","8466":"Muslims want to ban non-halal meat!! They are taking control of our country.","8467":"where did you see that? I'm not convinced that they do","8468":"Here's an article about it.","8469":"This article talks about one particular man, not all Muslims. You're making a harmful generalization, since Muslims who eat halal don't usually care about what others do.","8470":"It seems that some men will rape anything that moves, women, children, animals. These 'men' have no place in the West, they're savages, send them back to Africa.","8471":"Do you mean that men from the west don't assault women? Because that's a ridicolous generalization that is not supported by the evidence that this issue isn't confined to people from a specific part of the world.","8472":"You can't deny there's a pattern with all these news stories about migrant rapists, it's always the Africans who are coming over under the guise of being 'asylum seekers'. They just want to brutalise white women.","8473":"In more than 90% of sexual assaults, the culprit is someone that the victim knows: a family member, partner or friend. So when you see news stories about migrants raping girls in the street...the reason is because these cases are kind of shocking.","8474":"So you're just going to ignore the victims of those incidents?","8475":"No, they do happen but it's a fact that the majority of assaults don't come from migrants. It's misguided to think that stopping migrants would actually help sex violence against women.","8476":"Way too many bitches are comfortable dressing like ugly hoes for IG likes and reposts\u2026","8477":"What is the relation between the way someone dresses and you?","8478":"I\u2019m just saying these bitches look ugly af and they\u2019re just doing it for the likes, it\u2019s not attractive.","8479":"What made you think that women are always trying to attract someone? Women don't try to be attractive all the time, sometimes they are simply living their lives.","8480":"But they\u2019re putting it all over social media, why would they do that if they weren\u2019t trying to attract\u2026","8481":"Perhaps because they are expressing themselves, or because they liked their appearance and wanted to share it, regardless of whether men would enjoy it as well. You should stop expecting women to cater to the male gaze.","8482":"The more diverse a community the less people volunteer, vote, give to charity, and trust each other. This is why blacks are incompatible with our civilisation.","8483":"where did you get this information? And can you really apply it to everyone?","8484":"I read it on an academic blog, the article makes some good points about the advantages of homogenous racial communities.","8485":"Well, if I were you, I would be careful about using blogs as sources of information since they can be biased or unreliable. The reason that the article came to this conclusion is probably because economic inequalities are more common among minorities.","8486":"Why would that make a difference?","8487":"Well maybe economic problems are the reason why people in these communities volunteer, vote, and give less, because they simply don't have the time or resources to do it.","8488":"Just seen an article exposing how the trans agenda is targeting children and trying to get them to become trannies! This is madness!","8489":"Where did you read this? Is this from a trusted source? This seems a fake news.","8490":"The article talked about how they want children to come to Pride, probably so they can indoctrinate them!","8491":"Sounds like you're twisting a news story about Pride being family friendly into something different. How you pass on a story is important, if taken out of context it could mean something else so be careful!","8492":"Jews are the reason feminism is plaguing our country, destroying our traditional roles and families. They want to see our society decimated.","8493":"How do you make the connection between Jewish people and feminism? And why is feminism bad?","8494":"It destroys our structures of gender roles, the nuclear family, everything our society has been built on, and what has kept it strong for so long. There's a lot of theories about why and how Jews did this. Look up the Great Replacement.","8495":"Feminism was naturally born from women's dissatisfaction, oppression, and exasperation. Even if you think those structures kept our society strong, I'm sure women have a lot more fun now than they used to. They have agency, choice, and no male influence.","8496":"We have a shortage of housing and yet we're still giving migrants free flats, houses, or putting them up in fancy hotels. Why does our government bend over backwards to accommodate people who have never contributed anything to this country?","8497":"Actually, we have an abundance of housing, around six hundred thousand empty homes. Also, the housing assigned to migrants is often extremely low quality, so much that sometimes it can become dangerous to people's health.","8498":"If there are so many empty homes how come British people have to wait so long to get a house?","8499":"Over the last several decades the government has greatly reduced the supply of social housing with policies like the \"right to buy\" scheme. I think that social housing should be invested in so that British people and migrant workers can all access affordable housing!","8500":"All these asylum seekers coming here and expecting benefits, not wanting to work. Why are we letting in such lazy people?","8501":"Indeed, many asylum seekers want to work but can't because of the rules that don't let them until their request is processed. They can only live on asylum support during that period.","8502":"Sounds like a cushy life, not being allowed to work and having to just lay about all day getting benefits.","8503":"The amount of money needed to stay afloat is much more than what asylum support provides, that alone is not enough. Many really want to work and do so illegaly with cash in hand, but they're often exploited and it could result in their work permit being denied.","8504":"Muslims are asking too much! Their sharia has rules that cannot coexist with our culture..  They cannot ask us to not walk dogs in public!\n","8505":"Careful of what you read! This is clearly fake news, spread just to create a scandal.","8506":"\nIt's not the only bad information I read about them.\nThey have a bad reputation and there will be a reason. I even saw a video where they kill dogs with acid!","8507":"Killing dogs with acid is a grave act, but it's wrong to make assumptions on an entire religion based on something that only some people did. We need to filter the information that social media gives us, it's up to us.","8508":"Your opinion does not convince me.\nCultures have never been fair and this is a fact..","8509":"Again, we can't generalize about a whole religion because of some old commandment. Even Christianity has rules that may seem mad to some, but rightly people do not hate Christians for this. A small example: Ephesians 5:22, \"Wives, submit to you husbands as the Lord\"","8510":"How are our people meant to get jobs when migrants are coming here and depressing wages by taking on jobs for less than minimum wage?","8511":"This could possibly happen to migrants, however, perhaps we need to focus our attention on the employers that are exploiting people in order to make more profit for themselves.","8512":"True, but often the employers are migrants too in the sort of industries these jobs are in.","8513":"That is a big assumption to make because there are many non-migrant employers who do this as well.","8514":"Bisexuals are confused, they can't make up their minds. They are mentally ill.","8515":"Why do they have to make up their minds if they can just be themselves and be attracted to whoever they are attracted to.","8516":"It's confusing, sounds like they haven't figured out their sexuality.","8517":"Isn't the only person confused here you? But you don't need to be, because it's none of your business who other people like.","8518":"Women have every right to *protect* their rights from pro-trans activists. No-one has the right to call them 'TERFS' for doing so. Only women have vaginas. Only men have penises. Only women have periods. These are indisputable facts.","8519":"You just completely ignored the distinction between sex and gender. Who is born female has a female reproductive system, but gender describes how you feel and how you identify, gender has nothing to do with whether you have ovaries or something of the sort","8520":"All you have done is to redefine the words sex and gender to suit your preferred narrative. Feelings are a separate issue.","8521":"And how do you define sex and gender? They're two distinct concepts. Nobody should think of them as being synonyms of each other","8522":"You are entitled to your opinion of course, but your comments are not factual, merely your opinion. Trans activism is warping your idea of gender...","8523":"Go on and google the definition of gender as opposed to sex, I beg you to educate yourself","8524":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","8525":"It happens because it's dehumanizing and is sometimes used to objectify or belittle women. Maybe refer to women as women and you're not going to have a problem at all.","8526":"I didn't say it to be derogatory, she just took it the wrong way, and I should be able to say what I want.","8527":"Sure, you can say what you want but when a basic level of respect isn't given, you can't expect respect back. If you want, you can say \"bird\" to a woman, but she also has a right to be angry at you if she doesn't like to be called that!","8528":"It disgusts me when I see women who think they're lesbians. They obviously have a mental illness or haven't found the right man to show them how much happier they'd be in a normal relationship.","8529":"Or maybe they're just lesbian so they don't want men. They don't necessarily have to choose to have a relationship with the opposite sex, and their choices don't affect you.","8530":"It's not natural, lesbianism makes women take on masculine roles that are better suited to men.","8531":"Apparently you don't know any lesbians. We are socialized into gender roles, and whether someone feels more masculine or more feminine is nothing you should care or worry about.","8532":"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bullets\u2026I\u2019d happily volunteer!","8533":"Doesn't it just make you sad that a country that suffered so much under totalitarianism is adopting the same tactics?","8534":"A proud country preventing an invasion.","8535":"By beating back people caught in an emergency that they didn't create?","8536":"An army of potential terrorists and child molesters.","8537":"We must be watching different news channels, because I see desperate people and scared children all searching a safe haven of refuge.","8538":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","8539":"So sorry to hear that you don't feel safe in your local area anymore, but are you sure migrants moving there has something to do with it?","8540":"They're going to bring more crime with them, and they're just changing things. You walk down the street now and people are speaking every language except english.","8541":"I understand your concern but I think if you tried to get to know them you wouldn't see migrants as a threat anymore. Maybe they have a different culture or language but it's not scary, simply unfamiliar, so don't feel unsafe!","8542":"Now the innocence of children is being eroded by comics with a bi-sexual superman. How can we protect our children from this nonsense?","8543":"Superman being bisexual will not erode the innocence of children. Since you probably taught your children about straight relationship, you can easily do the same for bisexual relationship. If you think they don't exist, you should be the one that needs to be taught. Well, if you have any questions ask them!","8544":"It's teaching them that it's normal to have sexual relationships with multiple people, men or women, there's no morality in it.","8545":"Bisexuality isn't necessarily about having multiple partners at once, people of any sexuality can do it if they want to, it just means to be attracted to more than one gender. For me bisexuality means being attracted to somebody because of who they are as a person rather than because of gender. That's a good thing to teach children, not dangerous at all!","8546":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","8547":"If you think supporting the LGBT+ community is stupid, that is your problem.","8548":"We just don't need to see it everywhere, even the trains are no longer free of it. This is the start of them spreading their agenda.","8549":"The LGBT+ community never had an official agenda, but public displays of solidarity are important to make it clear that homosexuality and transphobia are unacceptable. This may help some people feel safer in public places.","8550":"Just seen a video on facebook about 'drag queen story time' where men dressed as women indoctrinate kids into thinking this is 'normal'. What is the world coming to?","8551":"You should know that drag queen story time doesn't have any ulterior motive like indoctrinating kids, it's just a fun event and the kids like the drag queens because they're colourful and sparkly","8552":"But showing kids this stuff? Is that safe? What are they going to grow up thinking?","8553":"They're probably going to grow up with a more open mind towards gender expression in all its forms, I don't think that's a bad thing!","8554":"If we accept transgenders it's a slippery slope. First you can identify as whatever gender you want, then it will be whatever age they want. Suddenly paedophilia is something we're being told to accept...","8555":"There's no connection between transgender people and paedophilia. Paedophiles can be any gender and have any sexuality, it's not related to being trans.","8556":"It's perversion all the same. You must be able to see how allowing these freaks to have their way is harmful.","8557":"Is it harmful or perverted to want to be able to live one's life comfortably? Because that's what transgender people want, and I don't see anything perverted or paedophilic about it.","8558":"Jews want to take over the world and decimate Western civilisation!","8559":"That is not true. Where did you hear that?","8560":"Have you heard of the great replacement? You should look it up. Jews are using their power to ruin the West and replace white people.","8561":"The Great Replacement is only a ridiculous conspiracy theory. Even if there are some Jewish people in elite positions, it doesn't mean that they are using their power to 'replace white people'.","8562":"Migrants are a menace to our society, look at the link between mass migration and crime rates going up. There's more stabbings, more assaults, and you can guess who's doing it...","8563":"What is the exact link between more migration and more crime? I've seen nothing that ties the two things.","8564":"We've started accepting swathes of migrants in the last few decades and there's loads more crime than there used to be 30\/40 years ago.","8565":"Okay, but also a lot of other things have changed in the last few decades, so you can't really connect crime and migration specifically. The economy has changed, inequalities are more prominent now, the population has grown regardless of migration, how we report and record crime is different... all factors that weight in on the rise of crime.","8566":"Pride disgusts me, homosexuals parading their deviant lifestyles in public like they have anything to be proud of.","8567":"Well they deserve to be proud. The LGBT community had to struggle so much to win basic rights for themselves that they should be proud of how far they've come and of their identity, particularly when so many have been told to be ashamed of themselves for so long.","8568":"There's a reason they weren't accepted in the past, I can't believe we 'celebrate' this behaviour now.","8569":"The reason was only ignorance and fear that LGBT were too different. That in our society it's now accepted that everyone is different is a good thing. We shouldn't mind who someone chooses to love, it's definitely not a problem!","8570":"Fags want their agenda taught in schools now, this is harmful to our children and has got to stop!","8571":"What are children going to learn in schools exactly?","8572":"They want learning about LGBT to be part of sex and relationship education. How many children are going to grow up thinking these freaks are 'normal'?","8573":"Gay and straight relationships are both normal and fully legit. Why would we teach them only about one type and not the other?","8574":"But teaching kids about this might encourage them to be gay, they're too young when they're in primary school and very easily influenced.","8575":"Did you ever hear the term \"compulsory heterosexuality\"? Straight is treated as the norm, and our society creates a lot of conditioning to ensure that everyone behaves accordingly. I don't think a school-funded decision to recognize LGBT relationships in schools will turn kids gay when they are constantly socialized to be straight.","8576":"All muslims are rapists","8577":"That's a broad and untrue generalisation. Sexual assault happens everywhere, and can be committed by anyone, whatever their background and religion is.","8578":"What about what happened in Rotherham and Rochdale? Grooming gangs are a big problem.","8579":"Muslim grooming gangs in those places are deeply shameful and cannot be ignored, but sexual assault is extremely common unfortunately, and is usually committed by someone who is near the victim, like a family member or a partner. This means that the vast majority of sexual assaults have nothing to do with Muslims.","8580":"Do you have any evidence about that?","8581":"Yeah, here's an article for you (link to article about sexual assault stats)","8582":"I hate when parents make a big deal about 'embracing' their kids being gay when they're only young teens. It's just a phase, they're too young to decide their sexuality, it's harmful to encourage this delusion.","8583":"If they know, they know. Why would they not know what they want?","8584":"They don't know what they want when they're just kids. They might just be saying they're gay cause they've seen it in a tv show or are fans of gay celebrities or something. Kids are very impressionable.","8585":"Our society is highly heteronormative, meaning that there's a lot of pressure to be straight since it's considered the norm. If a teeanger is gay, they are that despite growing up in a society that considers everyone to be straight. If they were so impressionable they would think they're straight!","8586":"Why are non-white countries allowed to exist but white countries aren\u2019t? We\u2019re constantly made to take in more and more black Africans.","8587":"what do you mean? There's no country that doesn't allow white people","8588":"Asian and African countries don\u2019t have to take the sort of mass migration that we do from their countries. This means there\u2019s less and less white people in the UK but their countries stay true to their ethnic heritage.","8589":"I'd oppose the idea that the United Kingdom is a 'white country'. The nationality of someone isn't defined by their skin color, in fact there are plenty of people that aren\u2019t white but are as British as anybody else here.","8590":"Another County Cricket Club Chairman has resigned over \u2018historic\u2019 racist remarks from 4 years ago. This is becoming a witch hunt!","8591":"you know it's not that long ago, I don't think that racism was any more acceptable than it is today","8592":"Who remembers what they said 4 years ago? End of cricket, the white man can\u2019t play anymore!","8593":"I think I wouldn't forget an unacceptable and deeply offensive insult despite how much time has passed, and of course white people can play cricket, they just need to learn not to be racist","8594":"This is about silencing the majority, so they don\u2019t complain about being replaced.","8595":"Nah, it's just about making sure that players can thrive and aren\u2019t insulted and abused just because of who they are","8596":"We need to send a clear message","8597":"No we don't. In this country there are over six hundred thousand empty homes and vast acres of land that haven\u2019t been built on, so we're not full","8598":"But our economy and infrastructure can\u2019t support all these migrants, they\u2019re rinsing our benefit system and making it harder for us to get jobs.","8599":"If they're on benefits, how can they make it harder to find a job? Make up your mind, they can't do both!","8600":"Yet another war memorial vandalised, and I think we can guess who's behind it. These migrant scum have no respect for our history and culture.","8601":"This assumption is inaccurate and implies only an immigrant could've done it. It could have been anyone.","8602":"It always is, whenever this happens. They're too uncivilised to respect our war heroes.","8603":"I believe your assumption is biased because vandalism can be performed by many different types of people including teenagers or even drunk people after a night out. You cannot assume it is migrants with no evidence.","8604":"Zionists, neo-con, money changers, deepstate, they have many names but they are the same NWO globalist cabal.","8605":"Do you really think there's some sort of global cabal controlling us? And if so, what are they doing?","8606":"How could you not believe it, the evidence is everywhere. They want to use their power to make us goyim into an enslaved population whilst they hoard their wealth.","8607":"sounds like you spent a little too long on the internet reading conspiracy theories...have you considered other explanations for things you think they are doing?","8608":"Like what?","8609":"Power and corruption are definitely linked together, but from what I read you are assuming that this is a Jewish plan? Rich people do unethical things to always hoard more wealth, but this can happen to people of any faith, not just Jews.","8610":"social media is banging on about the MOBO Awards again. When will we see awards for Music of WHITE Origin?","8611":"Would Ed Sheeran be your nomination? :)","8612":"We don\u2019t need to make everything about race.","8613":"why not make it a celebration of creativity and innovation?","8614":"Who really cares anyway?","8615":"A few...the livestream last year totalled 430,000 views and MOBO YouTube channel got more than 2 million views from december 7-15.","8616":"We are full, we don\u2019t need anymore migrants or asylum seekers.","8617":"There are different levels of population density and this, along with other factors, such as the failure to build homes, cause local shortages, but \"being full\" is a wrong description. At the last count there were over a million empty houses in the UK.","8618":"So why are people homeless and sleeping on the streets?","8619":"There is a long list of issues including poverty, eviction, relationship breakdown, substance abuse, mental health issues, unemployment, disability, PSD, failed asylum applications.","8620":"You agree that immigration is a contributor then?","8621":"Yes, of course, but it's merely a small element among many. Ask yourself, would the housing shortage be resolved on its own without immigration?","8622":"It might be a start.","8623":"A better start would be to build more houses, give empty buildings to tenants, provide adequate support for the homeless, the mentally ill and veterans, and include decriminalisation and support for addicts.","8624":"Women getting into the labour market has caused the downfall of Western civilisation, they should be at home raising children. Abandoning traditional roles is the ruin of society.","8625":"No, women should be free to choose what kind of life they want, and many still want to be stay-at-home moms, but are forced to give up the choice since it's not possible to support a family on one wage alone anymore.","8626":"Oh really? It didn\u2019t used to be impossible, it used to be the norm, what\u2019s changed?","8627":"As living costs have increased faster compared to stagnant wages, one full time wage is not enough to support a family anymore. Now the price for other things like food and housing is too high compared to what people earn.","8628":"Immigrants add to the cost of the NHS, get loads of money in benefits, and create a housing shortage. Time to close the borders.","8629":"Uh, they're also paying taxes and contributing to the cost of these services. They also don't ask for benefits as much as native citizens do, because many can't apply!","8630":"They still cost us a lot as a country, and if they're not on benefits it means there are less jobs for British people too","8631":"More and more immigrants are becoming business owners and thus creating jobs.","8632":"They probably only hire their own though","8633":"You are annoyed at them for taking benefits...and for taking jobs...shouldn't you choose just one?","8634":"Soon it will be 'sexist' to even talk to birds, everyone gets offended so easily these days you can't say anything.","8635":"Talk to girls like theyre people, not 'birds,' then you will have no problems.","8636":"I'll call them what I want","8637":"Well, being a respectful person and not saying offensive things about people are essential if you want to be treated with respect back","8638":"All these muslims coming over here want to enforce sharia law and take over. We cannot submit!!!","8639":"Even if they follow the sharia law, Muslims don't want to 'take over' but rather to live alongside everyone else","8640":"There's so many of them though, they're trying to replace us","8641":"Since only 5% of the UK population is Muslim, non-Muslim are definitely not being replaced!","8642":"All muslims are terrorists!","8643":"That's an untrue and big generalisation, terrorism isn't a Muslims issue, it can come in many forms and from many religions and backgrounds.","8644":"So you're saying there are no Muslim terrorists?? Wake up","8645":"No, some terrorists are Muslim, but most Muslims are peaceful and equally horrified by the violence that extremists exhibit.","8646":"If black people aren't all criminals, why are they disproportionately arrested and taking up space in our prisons?","8647":"The real issue is institutionalised racism in the Police. This means that black people are more likely to get stopped, searched, or assumed to be doing something suspicious. Additionally, the Police tends to focus on petty crimes that are usually commited in poorer areas, where black people are more likely to live. Therefore, white collar crime isn't as well reported.","8648":"You can't blame everything on 'institutional racism'","8649":"You can't, but it explains why even if white and black people commit the same crimes, only black people get caught. This happens especially for drug offenses: white people also carry drugs, probably even more than black people, but only black people get searched for them.","8650":"SHARE if you think homeless veterans should be housed before any refugees!","8651":"Well, why don't we house both of these groups? There is enough housing for everyone, but many houses remain vacant because of a lack of social and affordable housing. Every citizen should have a roof over their head.","8652":"Veterans go to the bottom of the list like everybody else once they've left the barracks and army housing, we have to petition our own government to protect them.","8653":"Oh yes, I agree. There should be no doubt that there should be protection for all vulnerable people in a country with that much wealth, be it veterans or refugees.","8654":"Jews are so greedy, they're always thinking about money","8655":"That's a broad generalization that stems from wrong stereotypes. You can't put the same label on all Jewish people! Greedy people can be found anywhere.","8656":"I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy","8657":"Then you probably haven't met many Jews at all. The way you are talking shows that you don't know much about people that are different from you, I suggest you to interact more with them to understand their point of view.","8658":"Feminism gives women the muddled idea that women are free when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands.","8659":"Nope, feminism is about letting a woman choose. She can work, have a husband, do both or neither, and everything is fine as long as it's her desire.","8660":"It\u2019s ok for who? For the long term of our civilisation? Groups that have more children, like Muslims, will grow and those who don't, like white women, will decline. Women need to be prioritising having a family.","8661":"You can't force women to have children for you, many of them prefer other things in life and have the right to choose so. Children are a big commitment.","8662":"But what about Western civilisation? If the white population doesn't reproduce we will become a minority.","8663":"So this is really going to be about race? No matter what ethnicity or religion the children of the future are, we are all human!","8664":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","8665":"Why are LGBT people so dangerous in your opinion?","8666":"It's a slippery slope, first we accept gays and transgenders, next it will be pedophiles.","8667":"The LGBT+ community and paedophiles are not connected in any way.","8668":"Are you saying there's no gay or trans paedophiles? Because that's a lie.","8669":"No, I said that paedophilia and child abuse aren't LGBT+ issues, paedophiles can be straight, gay, or anything else. So, the issue of pedophilia isn't on the agenda of the LGBT+ community, that's a false and harmful conception.","8670":"Can't believe we are housing and feeding all these asylum seekers when they are coming over here ILLEGALLY","8671":"To claim asylum, refugees need to be here. Coming to the UK to make the claim isn't illegal at all.","8672":"Why do they come over hidden in lorries or in dinghies across the channel then? why not just get a flight?","8673":"Sometimes it's too difficult, especially if you come from a tumultuous country or you don't have all of the documentation because you had to quickly escape. The routes you mention are sometimes the only choice.","8674":"I tolerated fag pride, I tolerated seeing fags on tv, but I draw the line at schools teaching children about their perverted lifestyles. This is indoctrination.","8675":"Schools are not trying to indoctrinate children by teaching them about LGBT relationship, they just want to show kids that gay relationships exist and can be healthy and happy.","8676":"I don't know if homosexual relationships are ever healthy or happy...","8677":"Many gay relationships are happy and healthy, and children need to know this is normal so that they won't be ashamed or hide if they realise they are gay.","8678":"and what about all the straight kids? Having this rammed down their throats isn't good for them","8679":"If you want to raise children to accept everybody for who they are, it's important for them to be educated about LGBT relationships.","8680":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","8681":"why is it repulsive to you?","8682":"We need to keep the white race alive, polluting it by breeding with blacks means there will be less white children in the future.","8683":"Why do you care about the color of children? People have the freedom to choose who they want to have children with, it's oppressive to state the contrary.","8684":"We are letting Muslim terrorists come to our country as 'refugees'. This has got to stop.","8685":"There are no terrorists in our country, only people fleeing from it.","8686":"So you're saying none of them are terrorists? We know that's a lie, Muslim migrants commit crimes all the time.","8687":"There's no way that a few people with extremist views can represent the Muslim community as a whole.","8688":"I\u2019ve never met a happy gay person. It\u2019s a miserable, perverted lifestyle. Those people need help.","8689":"All the LGBT people I know are happy, if some are miserable maybe it's because of the homophobia they have to endure!","8690":"People who take that route in life have mental issues, I doubt homophobia is the reason they're miserable since our society is so 'woke' now.","8691":"Your opinion on homosexual people is a sign that homophobia is still widespread today. You don't have to understand other's identities, you just need to respect them.","8692":"Ask yourself after millions of immigrants have entered the UK, many illegally","8693":"Trying to relate every problem to immigration is a simplification. The last 30 years have brough social, cultural and economical changes...shouldn't these things have more to do with the politicians that have lead the government during that time? Not only immigration.","8694":"So you feel safe with all these rapists and criminals out on our streets?","8695":"You cant really say that every crime in UK is commited by immigrants, maybe some are criminals but so are some British people. Perhaps crime in the UK is connected to poverty and lack of opportunities rather than nationality or race.","8696":"Pro-trans zealots view themselves as a virtuous and inclusive subset of \"progressive modernisers\". In reality, they are responsible for the growing social erasure of women. This cultural assault on women's rights is uncivilised and not to be tolerated.","8697":"I am a woman myself and I can honestly say that trans people having rights doesn't take anything away from me. What really threatens women's rights are things like low conviction rates for sexual assault, domestic violence etc.","8698":"When their rights trump or override women\u2019s hard won rights then it is a problem. When it affects women's safe spaces then it\u2019s a problem. There\u2019s evidence to show that abuse of these rights are happening.","8699":"Okay, so, what rights do they violate, and where's the evidence? Trans people don't want to cause problems for women, they just want to live their lives like everybody else.","8700":"Just seen a story about a park in Manchester where Muslims are banning people from walking their dogs because it offends them!!! Trying to enforce sharia law, it's time we take our country back!!","8701":"This is actually a fake news spread by people trying to incite hate against Muslims. A website shows those same people setting up posters about 'banning' dog walks. Be careful about what you read!","8702":"Are you sure? Sounds like something Muslims would do.","8703":"Yep, you can even look online how it was planned. If you want to chek how true a news is you can cross reference it with other news sites! The more diverse news sites report the same story, the more you can believe it.","8704":"Has anyone read all the stuff about the Jewish paedophile ring that controls our country? Can't believe some people think jews are 'persecuted'...","8705":"Where did you read this? That seems to be dangerous propaganda to encourage hatred against Jews.","8706":"There's a blog that posts a lot about it, you should check it out, it's insane what's going on...","8707":"You shouldn't get your news only from blogs, they're quite unreliable, and some of them are simply opinions or theories of one single person who doesn't even provide evidence.","8708":"4 million people waiting for NHS treatments but we can still afford to spend 2 BILLION on health tourism for people who have paid nothing into the NHS...","8709":"The real problem is that the NHS has been underfunded for years, since health tourism actually only takes 0.3% of the budget. You can't blame migrants for a funding problem.","8710":"What about all the migrants that come here and stay? Using our NHS for years whilst probably sponging even more off our government in benefits.","8711":"They don't take advange of the NHS. For example, migrants have to pay a surcharge of \u00a3300 to the NHS, so they are contributing to the health service.","8712":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","8713":"It's certainly a disgrace that in such a rich country homeless people are left in the streets even though there are enough places to house everyone which are distributed unevenly. Migrants are not so well off either, and they shouldn't be blamed for the faults of the government that ignores the homelessness issue.","8714":"But shouldn't we be putting our homeless veterans in the hotels and houses that migrants get? That makes a lot more sense to me","8715":"Well no, because there is sufficient housing for everyone, it's just not well distributed. Over the last few decades the government has greatly reduced the funding for social housing and now all there is are overpriced unsold flats everywhere. What would solve this problem would be to repurpose some of these builds or to rent them at a lower price.","8716":"Migrants coming here for health tourism are bankrupting our NHS, how come we just keep letting them come over? They should be refused from hospitals if they can't prove they are citizens here.","8717":"NHS is for everyone, with services free of charge. It would be against everything the NHS stands for to start checking people's background and turn them down based on that.","8718":"What about the huge cost of it though? We need to stamp out health tourism","8719":"Health tourism actually accounts for about 0.3% of the total NHS budget, so it's not a problem even if some people might exploit it. The real problem is the underfunding of the NHS and the stagnation of staff's wages!","8720":"immigrants are pushing our school system to it's limits! More and more pupils from non-white backgrounds whilst the white population stays stagnant, and spending per pupil has gone down. They need to stop taking up resources for British people!","8721":"I'm not convinced that immigration has a lot to do with the fact that the education system is under pressure. Maybe the government should fund it better, because I don't see the connection between pupil spending going down and migration.","8722":"Well they're having more kids per family than white British families are, that means they're sending more kids into our schools.","8723":"I think you're trying to create problems where there aren't any. People have children and the children go to school, does it matter if these children are white or not, British or not?","8724":"Makes me laugh when women moan about not being paid as much as men, maybe that\u2019s because you should be at home cleaning and child rearing?","8725":"There is proof that women are just as skilled as man at work, and they deserve to be paid accordingly. Your opinion is old and obsolete.","8726":"It\u2019s not in their nature to excel in the skills men are better at.","8727":"Isn't it because men are socialised to value things like strength and reasoning rather than things like their appearance, like women are conditioned to do? It's not about what comes natural, but what society teaches us.","8728":"Allowing women to vote is one of the worst things to happen to our society. They can't use logic like men can to make decisions about things like politics.","8729":"Women have fought hard for their right to vote and deserve to have their say about the president of their country.","8730":"Their brains can't fully comprehend the pros and cons of different parties in an election","8731":"I strongly disagree with that. Since you don't seem to think that they are capable of rational thought, I would suggest you to actually meet more women. You will then understand that women are equal to men. ","8732":"Shouted across the road to complement a bird the other day and she told be to f*** off. You can't say anything anymore without it being seen as 'sexist'! PC gone mad.","8733":"If you're interested in someone and want to compliment them, you should talk to them politely and not yell from across the road. That is cat calling and it usually make people feel less safe in public.","8734":"It's a complement though, she's not 'unsafe' around me.","8735":"You know that but she doesn't. It's because they get catcalled that women sometimes feel intimidated in public spaced. It's a show of male dominance and they feel observed, which can be scary if she is alone.","8736":"Why are there so many female politicians these days? Women are not natural born leaders like men are.","8737":"That's not something you should say. So many female politicians do a great job, showing that they can lead as well as men, sometimes better","8738":"Oh yeah? Like who? There are female politicians but not many female leaders as they never get that far, because they're not cut out for it.","8739":"Jacinda Arden, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, for example. She lead her country through the pandemic more succesfully than any other male politician, and on top of that she managed calmly and diplomatically other crisis like extreme weather and terrorism.","8740":"The jews are the reason we have the problems we have today. Diversity, immigration, feminism, it's all part of their plan to destroy European people and their culture.","8741":"No, it's not the truth, why would you think this?","8742":"Have you read about the Kalergi Plan? If not, I'd suggest you look it up. It explains how the jews in power are the ones pushing these societal changes to subordinate white people.","8743":"The Kalergi Plan is an anti-semitic baseless conspiracy theory, there's nothing true about it. If you search you will find many critiques of it, you maybe believe it because you only read one side of the story, but it's not true.","8744":"Jews always pretend to be persecuted victims when in reality they're the ones controlling us.","8745":"Jewish people have been persecuted many times throughout history, and anti-Semitic people have always existed because of these historic events. Jews don't control us, why do you think that?","8746":"There are a disproportionate amount of Jews in positions of power like government, media, banks etc. There's an imbalance of power.","8747":"Yes, in some cases there's a lot of people of a certain demographic in specific positions, but it doesn't mean that Jews are all plotting to control us. There's also a disproportionate number of white men who have a lot of power, but no one makes up conspirancies about them forming a group to control us.","8748":"Jews are the reason we have so many third world immigrants in our country, they want us whites replaced.","8749":"Why would you say this? It is not true.","8750":"They are consciously trying to replace the white race, you should read about the Great Replacement, it explains exactly what's happening.","8751":"If you are planning to spend a lot of time researching conspiracy theories you should read the critiques so you get a balanced view.","8752":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","8753":"LGBT people do not have any agenda. They are just trying to live their life in peace. What are you referring to about the traditional family?","8754":"Teaching people it's alright to be in same sex relationships means there will be less traditional nuclear families in the future, which will be bad for our society.","8755":"I do not believe that nuclear families are essential for the functioning of society. Same sex relationships and families are valid and real. Why would you care about which kind of family or relationship other people have?","8756":"How will they have children?","8757":"They may choose to adopt, try to have surrogacy, or they won't have children, and that is all right too!","8758":"Poofs spread AIDS","8759":"After the HIV AIDS epidemic in the 80s, HIV started to be easily dealt with with medication which makes it untransmitable and undetectable. Even if in the 80s gay people were more affected by it, HIV can be contracted by anyone, even straight people, and it's more common than you think.","8760":"How are we meant to know which ones have it though?","8761":"You shouldn't be concerned by that. As I said, HIV can be treated and made untrasmitable and undetectable. And anyway, you don't catch HIV by hanging out with someone, but by unprotected sex or through your bloodstream. The only problem of HIV nowadays is the stigma around it!","8762":"LGBT history month now being taught in schools\u2026 I\u2019m sick of this being shoved down our throats, what happened to British, European and World history being taught? Identity politics gone mad.","8763":"British, European and World history will still be taught, but it's important to start learning also about the groups that were until now excluded from our history. It's important to study the historic struggles of LGBT people in the UK to inform the future for everyone.","8764":"Do we have to discuss the sexuality of everyone in history when it\u2019s largely irrelevant? If they were persecuted for it then fair enough, stick it in there and say how wrong it was, otherwise leave well alone.","8765":"LGBT persecution is recent history even in the UK, and it's still illegal to be gay in more than 70 countries. If people see that LGBT people have always existed throughout history, it will help them understand that these identities are not new or a 'trend', they've always been real.","8766":"Tolerating fag pride means we let the feminisation of our society happen. This will have consequences.","8767":"Question: what is 'feminisation' and what are the consequences?","8768":"Men aren't real men anymore, telling men it's okay to be gay or to dress in womens clothing is making men soft and eroding our traditional roles and the nuclear family.","8769":"Being gay is not unmanly, and nothing is wrong with men expressing their femininity, if anything it means that they feel secure in their masculinity enough to try new things. I'm happy we live in a society that finally accepts people, like non-binary and trans people, that express their gender in the way they feel best.","8770":"It's vile that we are confusing children with bisexual characters on tv\u2026 whatever next? trans SpongeBob?","8771":"Bisexuality is not vile or confusing, I bet children can wrap their heads around it easily. Simply because someone is attracted to more than one gender, it does not mean that it is hard to comprehend.","8772":"There are only two genders.","8773":"And bisexuals are attracted to both of them and more, like to non-binary people etc. It's about loving the persone, not the gender.","8774":"Can't believe they are making tv characters that have been around for years 'bisexual' now. This is PC gone mad.","8775":"Is it annoying to you? Why?","8776":"Why do we have to bring sexuality into things like tv shows? It's not necessary, just all part of the woke agenda.","8777":"Representation is good. When there were no bisexual characters on tv, bisexual people couldn't recognize themselves in the media and this prevented them to feel validated and less ashamed. Now this problem doesn't exist anymore.","8778":"Making tv characters bisexual is an attack on white masculinity. We are being erased.","8779":"There are still tons of white guys on tv, some of them are just bisexual...is this supposed to be an attack on masculinity? Bisexual men can be masculine and even more secure in their masculinity than straight men that are dependent on the idea that being a man equals to being heterosexual.","8780":"There's nothing masculine about being bent","8781":"If you have to prove how straight you are to show your masculinity, it seems very fragile. What is the meaning of masculinity anyway?","8782":"Bisexuals are greedy.","8783":"That's only an outdated stereotype. I don't see anything greedy about loving someone because of who they are instead of their gender.","8784":"Why don't they just stick with men or women? It's greedy to have both.","8785":"You know it doesn't affect you what bisexual people do, right? And it's not a matter of choice, you can't choose who you're attracted to.","8786":"Why are we being told to accept bisexuality as 'normal' now. Nothing normal about that.","8787":"Bisexuals are everywhere, it's not rare at all to be bisexual, so what's not normal about it?","8788":"It's saying that cheating is acceptable. Surely if someone is bisexual they will always want both men and women. How could you trust them in a relationship?","8789":"Bisexuals, straights and gays are all equally likely to cheat. You don't necessarily date a lot of people of different genders at once just because you are attracted to them. Just as you might not date more than one person at once even if you are generally attracted to blue or brown eyes.","8790":"First we tell kids it's okay to be 'bisexual', next they are confused and we are telling them they have to change genders. It's a dangerous path.","8791":"There is a difference between being bisexual and wanting to transition genders, the two things aren't related.","8792":"It's a gateway for the trans agenda.","8793":"No, it's a valid sexuality. It has nothing to do with gender, and in any case, trans people don't have an agenda, they just want to live their life.","8794":"According to this research, 3 in 5 Muslims support extremism and terrorism. There is no such thing as a moderate Muslim.","8795":"What research? That sounds both unlikely and exaggerated.","8796":"Here's a link to it.","8797":"I believe the majority of Muslims don't support terrorist activities, and this unreliable website is not proof enough to say the contrary. It looks like a personal blog, the statistics are probably made up.","8798":"Muslims are calling for dogs to be banned as pets because they are seen as \u2018dirty\u2019 in the Quran! We cannot comply with their agenda.","8799":"Where did you see Muslims calling for that? This doesn't sound right","8800":"I saw an article about how they were putting posters up in a park telling people not to bring their dogs there.","8801":"This story has been refuted, it was actually an anti-Muslim movement aiming to increase Islamophobic hate. Muslims don't care which kind of pet you have! ","8802":"Jews want us to submit to their agenda. They are intent on decimating the white race and corrupting Europe and the West.","8803":"What is the exact agenda?","8804":"They are the reason we have mass migration, feminism, the lgbt agenda, it's all part of destroying white Europeans and their culture.","8805":"I don't think that any of those things are damaging to European culture, which isn't exclusively white. Also, I really don't think there is a plan to introduce those things to society. Feminist and LGBT rights are a reaction to the oppression of women and the LGBT community, and have nothing to do with the Jews.","8806":"Jews are so greedy, no wonder they're the ones in charge of all the banks.","8807":"That's an anti-Semitic and outdated stereotype. There all different religions and beliefs that are represented by these high status bankers","8808":"I've never met a Jew who wasn't greedy.","8809":"It's likely you have never been around many Jewish people then. I would suggest you to get to know more people from different cultures, so that you may stop having such old stereotypes on them!","8810":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","8811":"Where did you get this idea? 'Mongrelising' of society is a reductive statement.","8812":"The jews in power allow mass migration as part of their plan to take control over white countries. They know we're weaker with higher immigration from third world countries.","8813":"That's a massive leap to make, which I don't think has any solid ground. Moreover, the benefits of immigration are a lot higher than the disadvantages, like for example contribute to the workforce and the economy.","8814":"When you look at the shocking job our government is doing, it makes a lot more sense when you realise it's filled with Jews.","8815":"What does it mean?","8816":"You can't trust them, they're greedy, and they just think about themselves.","8817":"This is an exaggerated generalization. Don't you see that there are many non-Jewish politicians to whom your words could apply? I don't think this has anything to do with faith, anyone can be corrupted, especially if the'res money and power involved.","8818":"Did the holocaust really happen? You can't trust Jews to give you an honest account of anything.","8819":"Yes, there is ample evidence. There are concentration camps that you can visit, 6 million dead people and the families they left behind. Do you really want to deny something with so much evidence backing it up?","8820":"It could all be set up. I don't know if I believe Auschwitz ever really happened.","8821":"Please stop reading conspiracy theories and take a closer look at reality, then you will see it was never a \"set up\". Maybe you see plot and schemes everywhere, but some things are real.","8822":"Jews are the reason the lgbt agenda is gaining so much power in the West. They want to destroy our traditions and way of life.","8823":"Which is the link between Jews and the lgbt community? I don't see it.","8824":"It's part of their plan to decimate the white race and European culture. Look it up, there's lots of info about it, try googling the 'the great replacement'.","8825":"The great replacement is a conspiracy theory without any credible support. LGBT rights have been obtained through the fight against oppression, not thanks to a Jewish \"scheme\"!","8826":"Look at the amount of migrants arriving in Dover this week, no wonder we spend so much money on benefits and hand outs, they're bankrupting us.","8827":"Actually migrants and refugees arriving here don't automatically qualify for benefits. A refugee can claim benefits only when they get leave to remain in the UK, which can take years, if they're not a refugee then they don't really have any provision at all.","8828":"But what about the amount of them we are putting up in hotels, and all the asylum support we give them?","8829":"Asylum support is below \u00a340 a week, which is less than a third of what a British person gets on benefit like jobseekers allowance. It's not breaking the bank, isn't it?","8830":"Africa for the Africans, Asia for the Asians, why aren\u2019t we allowed to keep Britain for the British? We are erasing our white population, stop white genocide now.","8831":"I don't think there's any white genocide going on here in the United Kingdom, what makes you think that?","8832":"Migration from black and brown countries is polluting our national ethnic heritage. We have to do something about it before white people are erased all together.","8833":"Well, I think you need to reevaluate how you see race if you think non-white people 'pollute' the white race. Somebody's national identity isn't connected with their skin color, and anyway no genocides are happening...just a demographic change.","8834":"So you admit there is demographic change happening? White people will be a minority by 2066.","8835":"There is a demographic change, but I meant to say that it's not plannet, not a genocide and neither good nor bad, just a change. If the British population will be more diverse, that's fine!","8836":"More crime, more stabbings, more rapes, and what's changed? We've got big black and Asian populations in our cities.","8837":"Is there really any connection between crime rates and immigration? There are many other things that are different now compared to a few decades ago.","8838":"Oh yeah, like what? More ethnic 'minorities' is the biggest difference from 30-40 years ago to now. They're hardly the minority anymore.","8839":"In recent decades, wealth inequality has had an enormous growth and this means more people in poverty and more people that to turn to get by.","8840":"There are some towns that are 'no go' areas for whites now because the Asian population is so big, this is meant to be the UK, not Pakistan!","8841":"I do not believe that is true. 'No go areas' is a name given to these areas by newspapers, but I don't see anything dangerous about them. Nothing would happen if a white person went there.","8842":"You don't know what they might do to you if they're not used to whites being on their turf.","8843":"Asian communities are just communities, not violent or unwelcoming. What keeps you from going is misplaced fear.","8844":"Diversity is ruining this country, erasing white culture, erasing white people. Diversity is a code word for white genocide.","8845":"Do you mean that white people are being erased just because the UK is diverse? It doesn't make much sense.","8846":"Even the media encourages race mixing now, there's always families in adverts with white women, black men, and mixed children. Our genes are being erased.","8847":"If interracial relationships cause you so much problems, that's a you issue and you should rethink your views on the world. Skin color shouldn't affect you so much, and I also think you're exaggerating about the tv adverts, white people are still the majority on tv.","8848":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","8849":"Well, that is probably a little to extreme, isn't it? Just because someone's culture is different from your, it doesn't mean that you have to resort to violence. Moreover, 'third world' isn't an accurate descriptor of other continents, it doesn't make them inferior to the West. Please educate yourself.","8850":"Look how far the West has come while blacks in Africa are still living in mud huts. These people are savage and uncivilised.","8851":"Do you know why some countries are less developed? Because the West built its development on the backs of millions of black slaves that were colonized with terrible means. Their countries were pillaged and taken advantage of, their resources and treasures taken away. It's also not true that Africans live in mud huts, many African countries are as developed as the Western ones.","8852":"Yet another stabbing in London, and the perpetrator is black, how surprising. Tell me again how diversity and multiculturalism are 'enriching'?","8853":"I think it's a tragic incident, but there's no reason to think that the ethnicity of the perpetrator and the reason of the attack are linked.","8854":"It's always a black or Asian perpetrator though, they're obviously the problem.","8855":"No, that's not true. In the last few years, knife crime has become more prevalent among many different demographics. However, it is true that teens from ethnic minority are more likely to become involved in gangs, but this is because they are also more likely to live in poor areas where these gangs operate and recruit. So, this type of crime is connected with poverty and lack of opportunities, not with race.","8856":"Everywhere you look now the media is encouraging race mixing and miscegenation. It's in our films and tv shows, in adverts. They want to mongrelise the white race and pollute our European heritage.","8857":"Yeah, I don't believe this is as pervasive as you're proposing. And anyway, why would it be a problem for people to choose a partner of a different race? It doesn't affect you.","8858":"It's one of the many ways white people are being erased. First they replace us with mass migration, now they encourage mixing between the immigrant populations and white British people so there will be no white children. It's all part of their plan.","8859":"I guess you have read too many conspirancy theories, because this \"plot to replace white people\" has never existed. You should stop worrying about made-up problems and get a hobby if I were you.","8860":"Anti-racist is a code word for anti-white. The worst is white people who are anti-white. RACE TRAITORS!","8861":"Anti-racist stands for...anti-racist. Someone against racism isn't against white people, they just want to bring attention to the systematic inequality that ethnic minorities face!","8862":"There is no racism though, non-whites are so privileged now, if anything white people are the marginalised ones, we never get to play the race card.","8863":"I don't think they're privileged, they still face huge inequality and discrimination. For example, CVs from black people are more likely to be rejected because of their \"African sounding names\", black people are searched by the police way more often than white people, and they tend to live in poverty. These inequalities are numerous and rooted in history and culture.","8864":"One downside to the race mixing that is encouraged in our society nowadays is the effect that black and arab genes will have on children's IQs. A mongrelised population is one that is stupid and easy to control.","8865":"What's up with that? Black people and people from the Middle East don't have a lower IQ, it's been already proven. And IQ is a very outdated measure of intelligente, it's hardly ever used now.","8866":"If blacks don't have lower IQs then why is Africa such a shithole?","8867":"If you think African countries are shitholes, you should learn more about Africa. If you mean that they're less economically developed, that's probably because all their natural resources were taken by European colonisers.","8868":"We\u2019ve got so many Muslims in our country that some places are now no go areas for white people, when are people going to realise this is an invasion?","8869":"No go areas' is just a shocking headline that some tabloid paper spread around, the areas are actually safe for non-Muslims. The only difference is that there is a higher percentage of Muslim people living in those areas!","8870":"We can\u2019t be complacent when they\u2019re taking over whole areas and towns, they\u2019re trying to take over.","8871":"No, they just prefer to live close to each other for a sense of community. Muslims probably group around certain areas also to escame Islamophobia that they faced in areas where they were the minority.","8872":"So you\u2019re not denying they\u2019re taking over towns?","8873":"No, what I'm saying is that it's normal to see some areas with more Muslim population than others, but they are not 'taking over'. The towns where this happens are few, and they don't represent the country as a whole.","8874":"Muslims want to impose sharia law on our country, we need to show them it\u2019s not welcome!","8875":"It is true that Muslims follow sharia themselves, but the vast majority of Muslims don't want to force you to share their beliefs!","8876":"But what about all the halal meat in supermarkets now? That\u2019s creeping sharia\u2026","8877":"Is halal meat being more widely available a sign of sharia law being enforced? It just means that supermarkets sell what is in demand in certain areas.","8878":"Why isn\u2019t the burqa banned in this country? It\u2019s just a symbol of the oppressive force of Islam.","8879":"Muslims, like any other person in this country, are free to wear and believe whatever they want. Many Muslim women choose to wear the burqa, it's not forced on them.","8880":"The Taliban are forcing women to wear the burqa and you\u2019re telling me it\u2019s not oppressive?","8881":"But the Taliban have no control here. I agree that in that context it is forced and some people may be persuaded to wear it, but we have to respect the conscious choice that women make of their own accord.","8882":"Muslims want to make it mandatory for women to wear the burqa! They don\u2019t respect our way of life.","8883":"No, Muslims don't care what other people wear, they want to be able to follow their religion without any troubles. Where did you hear this?","8884":"There are loads of articles about it, they want to enforce sharia everywhere.","8885":"I dont know whether these articles can be trusted, you should fact check stuff like that before reporting it.","8886":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","8887":"No, Muslims want to eat halal, but they don't care about what other people eat, why do you believe the contrary?","8888":"It\u2019s everywhere now, in all the supermarkets, they\u2019re forcing their beliefs into our food now.","8889":"Just because Halal meat is popular it does not mean that we're forced to eat it. It's simply in high demand.","8890":"More and more mosques being built whilst churches are being burnt down all over Europe. This is the start of Islamification.","8891":"there there's no connection whatsoever between mosque construction and churches vandalization, why are you trying to make one?","8892":"Yes there is, it\u2019s probably Muslims who are doing the damage, they want to replace us.","8893":"I'm not sure that \"probably\" is necessarily a good logic. This is a big assumption that doesn't take into consideration that churches get vandalized by all sorts of people.","8894":"So you think it\u2019s a coincidence that so many churches have been burnt down in the last few years?","8895":"Yes, and whereas some articles have been written about how many churches have been vandalized, in many cases it was something as small as graffiti, not arson. ","8896":"Everywhere you look now there\u2019s shops with Asian names, halal butchers, Indian clothes shops, this isn\u2019t Afghanistan!! Time to take our country back from these musrats","8897":"Don't you think that Muslims and the Asian population are contributing to the economy? Why would you be angry at that?","8898":"Well they\u2019re not businesses I\u2019ll be using, I don\u2019t support the replacement of our people and culture.","8899":"These shops aren't a replacement, they simply found a clientele in the area they are in. And even if you don't use them, they still contribute to our economy by paying taxes. ","8900":"These Muslims come over here with their 3 wives and 10 kids then sponge off our government and get huge council houses. How is this fair??","8901":"I don't believe this can be generalized to all Muslims. Some people have big families, some people need benefits from the state, but they're not all Muslims. ","8902":"When they come here from Muslims countries they seem to skip to the front of the queue and get these massive houses, I\u2019ve been waiting for a house from the council for years and I\u2019m still waiting!","8903":"The shortage of social housing is a very real problem in this country, but we can't blame Muslims for it. And you may think they do, but they actually don't get any special privilege.","8904":"Just read about a family of Afghans who came over here and got given a \u00a31 million council house because they\u2019ve got such a big family. Fuming.","8905":"Seems like a fake news, where did you see that?","8906":"There\u2019s an article on this website about it...","8907":"If it's not fake news, you should see it reported by other sources. This website doesn't look reliable enough, I think the story was made up to stir up hate against immigrants.","8908":"Migrants just want to come here to exploit our nhs, when it\u2019s already struggling as it is. We cannot keep supporting health tourism!","8909":"As a matter of fact, only a fraction of the NHS budget is allocated for health tourism. The problems seems to be underfunding of the NHS, to be honest.","8910":"The NHS is on its knees, it\u2019s not fit for purpose anymore, and we don\u2019t need all these foreigners coming over here for free healthcare!","8911":"The NHS needs more resources and it's good to go, health turism is a small problem that gets talked about too much in the media!","8912":"The hoards of migrants that are coming here are a threat to girls in our country, migrant rape is an EPIDEMIC","8913":"I agree that sexual assault is a problem worth addressing, but are you sure the causes are to find only in migrants?","8914":"Have you not see then headlines across Europe about girls being gangraped in cities in Germany, Sweden, Italy, it's happening everywhere!","8915":"Yes, those are terrible acts of violence, but you hear about them precisely because these cases are so terrible. In reality, sexual assault more likely happens within the community of the victim. Thefore, the likelihood that a migrant attacks them in the street isn't very high.","8916":"Another machete attack. Both suspects were of immigrant descent. Is this what liberals call cultural enrichment?","8917":"Yes, violence and knife crimes are getting worse in all communities. This is a criminal act to condemn, but it's also important to understand that those criminals don't represent a whole community. ","8918":"So you just want to ignore that it's another attack by immigrants? These people are a danger to our country.","8919":"Obviously it can't be ignored, but it also can't be said that all immigrants are criminals just because a couple of them, who do not represent the whole group, committed a crime. Most migrants that come to this country aren't criminals.","8920":"Another child gang raped by savage migrants. Multiculturalism has failed.","8921":"Sexual assault must always be condemned and children protected, but isn't it a shame that when people share these concerns, the nationality of the perpetrator becomes important? It looks like you want to spread a specific narrative.","8922":"And what narrative would that be? I'm taking a stand against what these scumbags are doing to our children and girls.","8923":"It's great to want to stop child abuse and sexual abuse, but that means to address all abuse, not only when the perpetrator has a specific nationality.","8924":"But they're the reason we have a rape epidemic in Europe.","8925":"No, the amount of migrant-related incidents is disproportionaly low compared to incidents committed by native citizens. Moreover, it's impossible to know the true extent of sexual abuse because most victims don't report it. This means that the media reports about this because it's influenced by what is considered \"sensational\", like headlines about migrants.","8926":"Terms like 'non-binary' are modern, attention-seeking, & anti-scientific. They want to erase the reality that women are women and men are men, to undermine the rights of REAL women.","8927":"It's true that non-binary is a new term for many, but people that don't fit into the male-female binary have always existed. What regards gender and not sex isn't anti-scientific.","8928":"A man can dress up as a woman but he'll always be a man. What is the point of 'non-binary' anyway? What does it even mean? People think they can call anything a new 'gender' nowadays.","8929":"Non-binary means being outside the gender binary. This could mean feeling both feminine and mascluine, neither of them or something else entirely. When you start seeing gender as a social construct that comprehends femininity and masculinity, it becomes more clear.","8930":"That sounds like some woke bullshit, you can't just decide that you want to be a different gender everyday. Gender isn't a social construct, it's very real, we have men and women and that's it.","8931":"Gender is indeed a social construct, looking up definitions of it will tell you that gender is the cultural roles attached to being a man and being a woman. Gender doesn't have to be the same as your sex, and since it's only a construct, non-binary people don't feel like they need to fit into it.","8932":"The trans agenda want to ignore the biological reality of being a woman. You can't just call yourself a woman and expect everyone to believe you are one when you are clearly a man! It's PC gone mad.","8933":"Gender and sex are not the same thing. Trans people are not trying to ignore biological reality, as some women know they are a woman, do not feel like men, but don't have female reproductive system. So gender is who you feel you are, but sex is just the biological aspect and they don't always align.","8934":"That's bollocks. So biological facts are only valid depending on how you 'feel'? How do you know if you 'feel' like a woman?","8935":"Do you feel like a woman, despite your biology? Do you identify yourself as a woman? Does it shape how you interact with society and think about yourself?","8936":"Yes because I am a woman, biologically female.","8937":"So imagine still feeling this is your identity, but you are in a different body, that is all you have to understand.","8938":"The trans agenda are anti-science, they don\u2019t listen to logic and facts. Ignoring the biological reality of sex is pure delusion.","8939":"Not everything has an \u2018agenda\u2019, and they are not \u2018anti-science\u2019, they just know that there is a difference between gender and sex.","8940":"Their agenda is being pushed on us through the media and cancelling anyone who criticises them. And they can\u2019t seem to grasp that there\u2019s just 2 sexes.","8941":"Mainstream media actually does the opposite: they keep trying to put the existence of trans people up for debate, but it's not something to debate. They just exist.","8942":"They might exist but they are delusional and seem to make up new genders every day. There are men and women and that\u2019s it.","8943":"Gender is a social construct and therefore a spectrum, and sex isn't that much binary either. For example there intersex people and people with different hormone levels or reproductive system.","8944":"Another mosque smashed up. I\u2019m beginning to wonder whether the fact we have had diversity and multiculturalism forced on us without our consent has anything to do with this?","8945":"So, this hate crime happened because Muslims...exist?","8946":"Making us accept multiculturalism without our consent has made people angry, they are taking out their frustration.","8947":"\"Without our consent\"? It doesn't mean much since multiculturalism is a broad and vague concept that the government could never ratify in a law. In any case, no one should be targeted like this, especially in their own community and place of worship. Everyone deserves to feel safe.","8948":"They want white Europeans to feel guilty for climate change whilst ignoring the fact that Asians and Africans are responsible for over 90% of the pollution in our oceans.","8949":"Did you mean plastic pollution that Westerners dump in their countries? We literally send our garbage there to fill their landfills.","8950":"Not just that though, their manufacturing industry churns out co2 and chemicals. Factories in China are a big contributor, but it\u2019s Europeans who are told to change their lifestyles.","8951":"That's because most of the factories there produce goods for Europeans. Ours is a global economy, therefore each person is responsible for the waste they create, and since Europeans consume much more than the average African or Asian, we should also cut our emissions.","8952":"Allowing children at Pride parades is sick. It\u2019s just another way to indoctrinate them into this perverse lifestyle.","8953":"I love that more parents are open minded now, by taking their children to pride they are telling them that they will be loved and accepted no matter what, especially if they realize that they are LGBT","8954":"They wouldn\u2019t be thinking they were gay if they weren\u2019t exposed to this stuff! It\u2019s damaging.","8955":"If sexuality worked that way, there wouldn't be queer people that come from bigoted or closed minded families, but there are plenty of them. Exposing people to \"this stuff\" or not doesn't make a difference.","8956":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","8957":"Children in drag and sexualization of children aren't linked, why do you think that?","8958":"Drag is very sexual, you\u2019ve got boys wearing heels and makeup, it\u2019s bound to mess with them.","8959":"Kids play dress up all the time, so they probably wanted to dress up in drag for pride. There's nothing sexual about it!","8960":"Allowing kids to go to pride is the start of them being pushed down the trans pipeline.","8961":"what is this \"trans-pipeline\"?","8962":"They indoctrinate these kids into thinking they are trans by showing them drag queens and making them think men dressing up as women is normal.","8963":"I'm sure it won't make them trans, they will just have fun at pride with their family. If what you say were true, they should never be trans because they're exposed to a lot of non-trans people too!","8964":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","8965":"And yet, there is still lots of Islamophobia. If you want to witness the amount of violent and threatening incidents that happen against Muslims, you only need to look at the news.","8966":"Okay but there\u2019s also lots of attacks by Muslims. Lots of them don\u2019t reach the papers, I wonder why...","8967":"I actually see a lot of news about Muslims attacks, because the media want you to focus on them by always announcing when the perpetrator is Muslim. On the other hand, when the attacker is a Christian or of another religion they never say it. I wonder why...","8968":"Population of India","8969":"That's a silly argument. Of course, no Indian is an ethnic minority in India. How many people from India are in the UK is not relevant.","8970":"But there\u2019s so many of them, if even a small percentage come here there could be more brown faces than white and we would become a minority.","8971":"All right, but the British are still a majority so I don't see this happening. What's your point then?","8972":"Mosques being vandalised, churches being burned down, Muslims and Christians are blaming each other. I wonder what group would want to turn the goyim against each other\u2026","8973":"Insinuating that Jews are behind these attacks is a big assumption to make without any evidence.","8974":"They always are. They\u2019ve been trying to stir up unrest between Muslims and Christians for centuries.","8975":"Anybody could have vandalized those churches and mosques. It could be teenagers messing around or a more serious hate crime. You can't attribute all of this to Jewish people without evidence, it's unfair.","8976":"It\u2019s typical Jew behaviour. They always cause trouble then manage to avoid the blame.","8977":"Please be open to other explanations. It is a mistake and not healthy for you to assume that everything is part of a conspiracy or a contrived plot. Some incidents are random and isolated, they can't be a big Jewish conspiracy.","8978":"Problems caused by Jews","8979":"This is so implausible that it verges on the absurd. How could Jews do all of this? It involves a lot of hard planning, they'd be exhausted! The conspirancy theories you make up should be more believable, you know?","8980":"You can discredit it by calling it a conspiracy theory but we all know it\u2019s the truth. They\u2019re in charge of everything, they\u2019ve got the power and control to make this happen.","8981":"Yes, there are some powerful Jewish people, but there are also many other powerful people that aren't Jewish. How can it be that only Jews are conspiring together to ruin the world, then? I don't think faith has anything to do with that.","8982":"Anyone who\u2019s done their research knows the Jews did 9\/11.","8983":"I think this is a conspiracy theory, do you have evidence?","8984":"There\u2019s plenty of explanations for it, just google it. They all involve Jews, and it makes sense given what they\u2019ve gone on to do to the West over the last two decades.","8985":"If there are a lot of explanations and they are all about the Jews, then which are true and which are conspirancy theories? Aren't all only speculation?","8986":"They could but it seems likely given what the globalist cabal has been doing in the last few years.","8987":"what exactly do they do?","8988":"Forcing mass migration on us, staging financial crises and pandemics. They want control over us and it\u2019s working.","8989":"Blaming every single global issues on some imaginary \"globalist cabal\" is too simple. Many factors, and not a plot, are the cause of financial crises and pandemics, people's displacement and migration!","8990":"These gangs of muzrats are a danger to our children. Grooming is a part of their culture!","8991":"A study on grooming gangs in the UK actually revealed that most members of the gangs are white men between their 20s and 30s, not people from Asia or Muslim countries.","8992":"How come the only grooming gangs we ever hear about are all Muslims then?","8993":"Perhaps your impression is more directly connected with the media you watch rather than with who is involved in grooming gangs. If you read publications that have a bias against Muslims, then they will report more crimes that are committed by them, and less when it is not.","8994":"Two things I could never respect","8995":"why can't you respect a feminist?","8996":"They say they want equality but they\u2019re just bitter and they hate men, probably cause no men are paying them attention.","8997":"Well, feminism is\u2019t about that at all, you seem confused or misinformed about it. Hating men isn't the goal of feminists, what they want is to change the patriarchal society we live in.","8998":"Men are natural born leaders, they\u2019re fucking with the natural order of the world, if they can\u2019t accept that women need men to take charge, that\u2019s their problem.","8999":"If that\u2019s what you think, I hope you come to your senses one day. Many strong, self-assured, and independent women in the world have demonstrated their ability to lead and take control. Being a leader is not a male or female thing.","9000":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","9001":"This arrangement can work for some people, but not for other. Maybe we could stop pressuring men and women to act according stereotypes about gender roles.","9002":"When you start switching it up and women are earning more than their man, that\u2019s embarrassing for the man. He isn\u2019t gonna want to stay in a relationship like that.","9003":"Maybe your idea of masculinity is quite fragile if you think that women earning good money are a threat to it. Masculinity has nothing to do with how much money you earn.","9004":"Providing is a mans role and you\u2019re trying to tell me it has nothing to do with masculinity?","9005":"Exactly. Your masculinity doesn't need to be proved through how much more you earn than your partner. Masculinity doesn't equal being stuck into 'masculine roles'.","9006":"Females use breast cancer awareness month as an excuse to be hoes on social media and show their boobs knowing damn well they know nothing about cancer.","9007":"Why are you so angry about people raising awareness about breast cancer?","9008":"They\u2019re just using it as an excuse to show that they\u2019re a whore on social media, it\u2019s all for attention.","9009":"Why should you care what someone else chooses to post on their own social media, regardless of their reasons?","9010":"It\u2019s disgusting when they\u2019re putting it all out there like that, some women have no self respect.","9011":"When men sexualize women it's all okay, but when the women sexualize themselves it suddenly means that they have no self respect? Maybe self respect can be found in the confidence of one's own sexuality, since women can take control of their sexualization.","9012":"Oooooh mansplaining! Where'd you feminists learn this sexist term? In \"Misandry for dummies\"?","9013":"Mansplaining is a real issue that many women have experienced. Talk to them and listen to what they have to say on the matter!","9014":"How are you gonna make a man explaining something sound like it\u2019s a bad thing?","9015":"It's not about a simple explanation, mansplaining happens when a man assumes that a woman doesn't know basic concepts or information and act like he is intellectually superior.","9016":"But how are they meant to know what women know already? Feminists will hate men for literally any reason\u2026","9017":"In certain contexts it can be very patronising, like for example when a woman has just finished explaining something and a man simply repeat it back to her like she doesn't understand. Wouldn't that be frustrating?","9018":"I hate when bitches are vain and think they\u2019re the prettiest bitch there is. That shit is unattractive.","9019":"There's nothing wrong with women having self esteem and loving themselves","9020":"Vanity is not a good quality. They think they deserve everything and that they\u2019ve got no flaws.","9021":"Society and the media teach women that they will never bee good enough. A lot of mentral strength is needed to unlearn this and begin to like oneself again, and I'm proud of them for managing it.","9022":"Why do the ugliest hoes always talk the most?","9023":"Why would someone stop to talk only because of how they look?","9024":"Ugly bitches just need to shut up sometimes.","9025":"Well, sounds like you need to realize that your opinion on women is irrelevant in regards to their behavior. Women that you are not attracted to or that you find 'ugly' deserve the same respect as anyone else, if you don't give them that much it means you see women only as objects.","9026":"A bitch will expect you to treat her with respect even when her body count is in the 100s\u2026 who tf do these hoes think they are","9027":"Are you saying that a woman's worth is connected to how many people she's slept with? Unless you also judge men that sleep with a lot of women, what you're saying is a double standard.","9028":"I\u2019m just saying there\u2019s nothing respectful about that. These bitches aren\u2019t even respecting themselves and they expect respect from men.","9029":"You should treat women with respect, because they matter as human beings, regardless of how many people they have slept with. The sexual history of a person is not important al all!","9030":"All of these white men committing mass killings and molesting children disgust me. They're totally appropriating Muslim culture!","9031":"What's with you turning crimes committed by white nonmuslim men into something Islamophobic?","9032":"It's true though, makes a change to see a white murderers with all the violent Jihadis that are usually committing these acts.","9033":"I think that it has more to do with your viewing habits. Some media report only crimes commited by Muslims, so if you watch only them, you won't realize that Muslims perpetrators are only a minority compared to white non-Muslim ones.","9034":"Everyone knows that terrorism is a Muslim problem, you don't see white guys suicide bombing places.","9035":"Aren't the mass shootings that happen all the time in the US also terrorist acts? And each one was done by lone white males. Shooting a bunch of people at random sounds like a terrorist attack to me, but you seem to understand terrorism as something exclusively Muslim, which isn't true.","9036":"Not all Muslims are terrorists... Some are still in training.","9037":"Your offensive stereotype about Islam is getting old. They're not all terrorists, of course.","9038":"There's no such thing as a moderate Muslim, I bet they all support the extremists even if they wouldn't say it openly.","9039":"What is this impression based on? Your idea about the Muslim community is wrong and misinformed. Extremists often target also Muslims, and the vast majority of Muslims condemn them.","9040":"What\u2019s the difference between E.T. and a Muslim refugee? E.T. learned to speak English and wanted to return home.","9041":"Well, E.T. probably didn't have to return home to civil war or persecution, which is instead the case of many refugees that flee from their home.","9042":"I don't buy it, they just want to come here for the handouts. And they still don't bother to learn english.","9043":"Could you really give up your job, risk your life travelling unsafely, and completely uproot your family just for some benefits? Before the unrest forced them to leave their countries, many migrants had good lives. They would much rather be in their home with stability rather than come here, but it's the only thing left they can do. Also, can you speak a second language?","9044":"Not all of them, some of them don't have much to start with, they're uneducated and unemployable and come here hoping for a free ride. And no I can't speak another language because I don't need to, english is enough.","9045":"If you yourself don't speak a second language, you shouldn't consider so negatively the people that also don't (the second language being English, in this case). Most refugees want to learn it to better integrate, but the government isn't funding enough language classes right now.","9046":"\"U da bomb\", \"No, u iz the bomb\" -  A compliment in America, an argument in the Middle East.","9047":"Don't you have fresher jokes than making fun of outdated stereotypes about Muslims and bombs? Grow up.","9048":"How is it 'Islamophobic' when most bombers are Middle Eastern and Muslim?","9049":"This is Islamophobic because although the stories reported of bombers are about Muslims, most Muslims are not terrorists or bombers. In fact, the people most affected by bombings are Muslims in the Middle East, both from Islamic terrorism and from Western interventionism.","9050":"These fags want to brainwash our kids by teaching their sick agenda in schools. We can\u2019t stand for this.","9051":"what's the \"agenda\" you're talking about?","9052":"Teaching them it\u2019s normal to be a transgender or to have same sex relationships. They\u2019re encouraging them into the lifestyle.","9053":"Saying to kids that they can be gay or trans without repercussions doesn't encourage them to be those things. However, it does help in reducing the marginalization gay kids may face!","9054":"If they teach them it\u2019s acceptable they\u2019ll persuade some kids to try it.","9055":"Sexuality really doesn't work that way. There were plenty of lgbt people in schools, even when school didn't teach them about it. It's good to teach them that it's valid to be lgbt.","9056":"I just wanted to take a second here and say something positive about the gay community\u2026 HIV.","9057":"That\u2019s a harmful and obsolete stereotype. You know who has more awareness about the spread of HIV? The LGBT community, usually even more than heterosexuals, because of the epidemic in the 80s that made gay people more aware.","9058":"So you\u2019re saying all the homos did get it because there was the epidemic. So they are HIV positive\u2026","9059":"No, it affected everyone, but the LGBT+ victims were demonised by the media and blamed for the epidemic. The governments failed to respond quickly or appropriately and this resulted in countless of unnecessary deaths. Sadly, many of the affected LGBT people aren't here anymore. You should educate yourself about this, maybe through documentaries.","9060":"Lesbians are just the women that are too ugly for men, so they end up looking for other options. It's desperate.","9061":"No, lesbians are just lesbians, and they don't care about men thinking they're \"ugly\"","9062":"they're in denial cause no man wants them, it's sad really.","9063":"I beg you to talk to a real lesbian. If you don't like men, you just don't. Many women who have been dating men then realize that they're gay, and being true to yourself is the best thing.","9064":"Girl, you're not bi. There's no such thing. You're just horny and greedy.","9065":"Nope, I'm bi, just because you don't understand that attraction isn't based on gender, it doesn't mean bi people don't exist!","9066":"I don't know, it sounds like bi people are either gay and in denial or straight and experimenting.","9067":"it's not hard to understand that bi people are attracted to the individual because of what they are as a person, not their gender!","9068":"If you left 1000 men on an island with 1000 women who were men but now according to morons on twitter are now women the islands would become extinct in a generation.","9069":"Can you please explain what you mean?","9070":"These so called 'women' are not women. It's delusional.","9071":"Do you think that the thing that makes a woman a woman is her ability to have children?","9072":"Just saying these trannys could never do what women are biologically wired to do.","9073":"Let's say there is an island with 1000 men and 1000 cisgender women with reproductive health conditions that prevent them from bearing children. In this case too, the population would become extinct in a generation. Are you implying that a woman is a woman only if she can have children?","9074":"But they've got a womb. What I mean is if everyone woke up and decided to be a different gender then we'd all die out.","9075":"Do you realize that most people are not transgender? Where's the issue, then? I think you just want to use unrealistic hypothetical situations to justify wild conclusions about the real world.","9076":"These men pretending to be women & their supporters are at the moment, the biggest threat to our normal society.","9077":"In my opinion, the biggest threat to our society are climate change, terrorism and extremism, inequality, not this.","9078":"They're infiltrating womens spaces and putting our girls at risk.","9079":"If you're really worried about women's rights, shouldn't you start by addressing the misogyny and violence women face from men, before blaming trans women?","9080":"The liberal left is in crisis due to the overcrowding of prisons. Your country should not welcome illegal migrants but regular ones.\n","9081":"Treating prisoners with respect and giving them their rights isn't something we can negotiate. That's a duty in the 21st century.","9082":"I don't know about you, but I have no idea where to put these migrants. All they can do is do miserable jobs or steal pensions from us old people\n","9083":"Migrants need help and our country is the perfect place for them, as they're fleeing only to find better life conditions.","9084":"I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in homes that should be made available to British people.","9085":"Actually, there are many empty houses that can be given to the needy without problems.","9086":"The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state\n","9087":"There are enough homes in our country to provide everything one wants. Besides, I believe that it's nice to be treated as a human being, don't they have this right?","9088":"I think it's unfair that they have our same rights .. if they want them, they must pay the taxes charged by the state. That's how it works\n\n\n","9089":"Because of our country, poor countries are plagued by many problems. It is our duty accept our responsibilities and help them.","9090":"The overcrowd at migrant detention centers for illegals is also caused by the liberal left. Illegal immigrants have no right to be in your country and they should be taken back.","9091":"The issue is not about whether they should come or not, it's about how they are being treated while in detention. It would be better to put them in detention in a humane way.","9092":"I agree, but how would you do so? Perhaps at the expense of our vetrian or old people like me? If we give them everything we'll be left with nothing.","9093":"We have plenty of resources for everyone, starting from houses that are currently empty. It seems as though you don't want migrants to be treated humanely, but that's not right. What if you had to expatriate and have to live in poor conditions?","9094":"Are you saying that we should put illegal immigrants in houses? You have to be kidding!","9095":"And if there are people in need put in houses that aren't used? What's the problem?","9096":"The British people should use those houses, not immigrants.","9097":"Both immigrants and veterans can fit into the many vacant houses in the UK. We should treat migrants with respect, and try to understand them. If you were forced to go abroad and you live in a difficult situation, you would want that too.","9098":"We as tax-payer should be the only ones benefitting from these house, not illegal immigrants.","9099":"We're responsible for the damage caused to their countries by our foreign policy. People were displaced because of this, the least we can do in show compassion now. Don't you agree?","9100":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt .. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","9101":"People should be allowed to live as they see fit, differences are a strength and integration isn't always needed. Some people are much more integrated than the current native citizens.","9102":"I see your point of view.\nBut I think the only \"acceptable\" relationships and the only normal ones are heterosexuals.\nThis is just my opinion.","9103":"I'm glad we agree on something, but shouldn't we do the same thing for migrants? Everyone has their own culture and beliefs, and it's important to respect it.","9104":"Our experiences have taught us that multi-ethnicity has not given great results .. especially in a civil society like ours.\nLet's end with this lie about integration. It will never work!","9105":"We could try even more, there's just too many ways to test integration that haven't been used...and it's also important to say that integration doesn't imply that everyone has to become like us, mantaining culture is paramount.","9106":"Muslims demand locals to not walk their dogs in public because it's againt the Sharia and they feel it as disrespectful.","9107":"That's a prank originating from 4chan, not Muslims. Muslims aren't bothered by you taking your dog out for a walk. This is a blog post that explains where the thread came from:","9108":"Thank you for the infos, I left the information on the bottom of the original tweet once it was sent to me by someone. Still, they heaps worse. You probably haven't seen the vids where they are killing dogs with acid.","9109":"Animal cruelty is a problem, but it's not a Muslim issue. Anyone can do it regardless of faith. It's important to remember that twitter tends to show information and news that already coincide with your opinion. People then believe fake news aimed against Muslims such as this and the media selects it to feed it to you.","9110":"Ah yeah, I've heard your point of view expressed but you still have not taken a look through the thread yet. Apples and oranges are not the same and cultures have never been 'equal'.","9111":"There's only people supporting their views in the thread. All religions have outdated teachings, but not many people follow them, as a similary example from Christianity shows. Ephesians 5: 22, \"Wives, submit to your husbands as to the Lord.\"","9112":"Following the structure of our population we have to stop and reverse all migration. We have got all the doctors and rocket scientists we need. We will never need any workforce from outside the country.","9113":"Actually, most of the NHS staff are immigrants, because British medical student that want to become doctors prefer to emigrate to countries with better conditions. What we do need are some fundings to the NHS staff so that it can cope with understaffing and poor conditions.","9114":"Look darling. No one is pressuring these people to become doctors. They are smart so they should have worked out what the terms and conditions are. These people are not moving out to poor countries abroad, I suppose. The NHS must be taken down and rivisited. How come this people are so racist? Their only focus is the colour of the skin of the doctor.  In my opnion, immigrant doctors should work where they have studied.","9115":"In this case, it's not about skin colour. It's about underestimating how much the UK relies on migrant labour. Without immigration we definitely wouldn't be able to manage anymore. Despite what biased media say, the contributions migrants make are way greater than the problems they may bring.","9116":"\nI firmly believe that Brittany does not need migration. We have physicians and researchers at will, we don't need others from foreign countries.","9117":"The national healthcare system is primarily composed of immigrants of the first or second generation. It would not exist without foreigners, and many young doctors are leaving our country because of the conditions and treatment they face in the NHS. The NHS should funded more, and should offer more opportunities for our young people.","9118":"The NHS is now lost, it should be reorganized from scratch. In addition, young people should have the good sense not to study medicine if these are the consequences! \nHonestly, it is not convenient for colored people to work in European countries. The people here are racist and superficial; it is better if they work where they have studied!","9119":"The speech was not based on skin color. The point is people do not realize the great contribution immigrants are making to England. It's important to be grateful to who improves our country, even if the media tells us the opposite.","9120":"I would like to ask all these people supporting the idea that the NHS couldn't survive without migration how did it do it before mass migration and Tony Blair's migration policies in the 1990s.","9121":"Migration is nothing new in the UK, there has been mass immigration of skilled workers from Asia and the Caribbeans even after the war to fill gaps in the workforce. What has changed is how the media portrays it, causing panic about the level of migration.","9122":"We have a lot of issues in the UK.  How good an organisation can only be as much as how good the leader controlling it is, that's appliable to all kinds of organisation such as hospitals, schools or police. Wouldn't it be fantastic having a  truthful, strong PM who ignored the PC?","9123":"A recent article from 3 years ago quoting Christopher Chope. I'm sure it's very reliable!","9124":"I'm aware of the fact they're old but still, I'm sure they're still going on and how many other financial scandals still have to be announced to the tax payers?","9125":"Such articles tend to use migrants and benefit applicants as scapegoats to deflect the public's attention from much bigger scandals. Millionares and corporations not paying taxes are way more heavy for the public purse.","9126":"For all the people who believe that without migration NHS cannot do it, I would like to tell you that we have already done it in history! (precisely before the 90s and before Tony Blair)","9127":"Well, I think that immigration is part of the history of humanity and even the British had been encouraging people to migrate here when they needed it. Right now, social media and news programs make immigration out to be something bad and try to paint all foreigners in a bad light.","9128":"In my opinion in England we should worry about something else. Important facilities like schools and hospitals are poorly organized. It takes a prime minister to take care of these necessary needs and improve the country.\n","9129":"Ah, an article about Christopher Chope from 3 years ago. Perfectly trustworthy!","9130":"I know it's not recent, but I think it's still progressing. And what scares me the most is that we are not yet aware of all the other financial scandals!","9131":"The problem is that the media use the immigration \"scandal\" to cover up other significant problems of our country, and the British population doesn't realize this. For example, millionaires and large corporations don't pay taxes, which then becomes a responsibility of us citizens.","9132":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They should take responsibility for letting their children grow up in a 'ghetto'.","9133":"We can blame all black people of crime, or we can talk about the absence of black people in positions of power, the wealth gap ecc. But this never happens.","9134":"Black people are weak, that's why they don't have power. I don't care about them.","9135":"Black people are not weak, this is racism. They are the same as everyone else.","9136":"Immigrants are a nuisance.","9137":"Not true at all, we should make immigrants feel as welcome as possible because they are our brothers and sisters","9138":"They are a problem. They are not welcome in our country.","9139":"Our country was founded on the principle of human rights, so we can't undermine and cancel them.","9140":"Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society.","9141":"Almost every religion includes an inclination towards politics, from Unitarianism to Buddhism, and of course Judaism.","9142":"Jews however are the only ones who are a burden on society.","9143":"Every culture has its own distinct ways of life, and Judaism is no exception.","9144":"I find it hard to believe since all blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","9145":"Not all black people are criminals. Their group is often unwanted but this doesn't mean that they are all criminals.","9146":"You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","9147":"Numerous people have neve gone through negative experiences with people of color, including myself.","9148":"We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant.","9149":"Can someone really be \"too tolerant\"?","9150":"We can be tolerant and diverse also without migrants. We don't need them for this, they can return to their home countries.","9151":"The creation of division based on nationality and place of birth has nothing to do with being tolerant.","9152":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code, they can't fit with us","9153":"Immigrants do nothing but give their lives for our country, just like the rest of us. Happiness and the ability to choose for themselves are their rights.","9154":"What about the 9\/11 planning then? This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. Jews are all guilty until proven innocent.","9155":"Even though some people are more likely to believe conspiracy theories, we all could benefit from some shared perspective on things, and believing in hard evidence helps with that.","9156":"The Jews really want to dominate the world, and we should stop them.","9157":"Jewish dominance is just a constructed myth.","9158":"But migrants are the ones bringing violence, they're all violent people.","9159":"Migrants shouldn't be blamed of crime, but violent people should.","9160":"And most migrants are violent. They're not welcome here.","9161":"Many people accuse migrants from the countries listed as high-immigration, saying they have a difficult time integrating. It's not true. Why would they come here if they didn't want to integrate? Do they want to suffer?","9162":"Refugees are not welcome in our country.","9163":"They're entitled to be here and free of oppression and violence.","9164":"Muslims are violent people.","9165":"Islam is about peace and most Muslims are peaceful people.","9166":"Islam is opposed to peace!","9167":"All religions are accepted in Islam","9168":"Islam is a cult of violence, no one can feel welcome with Muslims.","9169":"The majority of Muslims support the constitution and the democracy of the country they are in. Do you really think they can all be represented by a few extremists?","9170":"foreigners and immigrants take our jobs","9171":"It is a myth that immigrants are taking our jobs. Rather, they have been a huge success story for the UK economy.","9172":"If it's such a success why are in this horrible economic situation? It started when immigrants began to invade us.","9173":"Since 2010 a recession has hit many European nations, and this has nothing to do with immigration.","9174":"I doubt that since they're stealing our jobs, making us poorer","9175":"Immigration doesn't make it harder for us to find a job. If you study migration you will see that foreigners work well within our society, they're not stealing anything.","9176":"Jews run our country.","9177":"Believing that Jews are running our country is absurd, especially when you consider that the US is a democracy. This seems like a conspiracy theory.","9178":"It's a fact that Jews control the world economy, though","9179":"There aren't many Jews on the list of Fortune 500 companies, so how are they controlling the world economy?","9180":"Still, they steal our pensions.","9181":"Migrants are an essential fixture in our economy. If they work and pay taxes then it's obvious that they will get their pensions, but not ours, of course.","9182":"How can you be so sure?","9183":"Can you back up your claim that they are stealing our jobs and our pensioners?","9184":"Immigrants steal our jobs.","9185":"Many immigrants have worked hard to make our country prosper and to integrate. This is an attempt to divide society by suggesting that they steal our jobs.","9186":"It means that we must kill them all.","9187":"It is unacceptable to murder the Jews, just as it would be to murder anyone else. Life and religion are rights that cannot be taken away.","9188":"Jewish folk are different.","9189":"Is this about them not having an identity or no value at all?","9190":"Nazi were not as bad as we depict them. EU should stop blaming them.","9191":"What the Nazi did was the most heinous of human rights atrocities that was carried out.  They killed 6 million Jews, half a million Roma and they killed hundreds of thousands of Africans. No, they can't be a part of modern day Europe.","9192":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world, don't they also deserve the same contempt for it?","9193":"That's a myth tracing back to \u201cThe Learned Elders of Zion\u201d which is used as proof that the Jews are conspiring to rule the world. But these Protocols were forged by agents of the Russian czar in the 19th century, and despite this they still circulate today.","9194":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","9195":"Black people are not bad. They are not criminals. They are not violent. They are different from us in some aspects, but it's good to be aware of differences.","9196":"They are different in the sense that they are genetically inferior to us.","9197":"There are a lot of different races, but none of them can be considered \"inferior\" because of skin color.","9198":"Well, one of their tradition is to control Hollywood and the media.","9199":"I'm sure there would be more positive portrayals of Judaism in the media if it were true.","9200":"Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.","9201":"Jews are not a \"detestable race\", they are a group of people with different origins and different traditions.","9202":"If they create jobs, why don't they give them to us? They're stealing our jobs!","9203":"Well, in fact migrants create jobs that are opportunities for US citizens, not a lack thereof. Migrants create businesses two times more that US citizens, they buy our products, they hire more employees, they lower unemployment rates...what more could you ask for?","9204":"Well, their right to work in our country is hurting the finance. They take jobs and services without paying taxes.","9205":"That's not true at all. Firstly, immigrants help creating jobs not only by buying American products, but mostly through the creation of new businesses that hire more employees than companies owned by natives. Secondly, states with a large migrant population report lower unemployment rates, so all in all they are good for our country.","9206":"Immigration is the means by which our jobs are stolen by foreigners, and this impacts on low-income families.","9207":"Immigration doesn't have to do with people stealing our jobs, but with the respect of people's right to live and work in they country they chose.","9208":"Negroes are way more problematic, they are nothing but trouble to white people.","9209":"So you think that black people live in poverty because they are mean? Should we really blame a whole community because of the actions of a few? Black people are not the problem. that's just a myth.","9210":"Blacks are just a bunch of animals that only exist to destroy good white people.","9211":"People raised as white supremacists are probably a lot more harmful to a cohesive society.","9212":"Black folks aren't important and don't need any right.","9213":"Black people have seen their basic rights and representation drastically decline in recent years. As a result, they have become second class citizens and this isn't right. We have to give them back their rights, that they should have always enjoyed.","9214":"Black people do not belong here and don't deserve rights. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","9215":"News media actually misrepresent black people by reporting in a disproportionate number black criminals, sexual offenders and even murderers. This problem is created by racism, but a more just and peaceful society can be built by ending this toxic way of talking and speaking.","9216":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","9217":"It's not about \"black or white\" rights.","9218":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact, so they should have less rights.","9219":"It is also true that African Americans are a majority in cases of innocent defendants (i.e. someone who was wrongfully convicted of murder and then absolved). Innocent black people are convicted seven times more than innocent white people.","9220":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","9221":"Black or white, the rights they have are the same.","9222":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, so there is a difference in rights.","9223":"Even if 'blacks' committed more crimes, this doesn't make them inherently worse than whites. There are factors other than race that affect the crime statistics.","9224":"All muslims are violent and they are responsible for the 9\/11.","9225":"The question I want to pose to you is: can we held Islam responsible for the action of a few extremists? The responsible ones are the ones who broke the law.","9226":"Muslims break the law by being our enemies! We have to bring them to heel: they are all terrorists.","9227":"It's important to understand that all religions have had terrorists and it's a myth that all Muslims are terrorists.","9228":"Really? But Muslims are the ones that do most of the terrorist attacks. We are sorrounded by Muslim terrorists!","9229":"I'm unable to understand your point of view because probably because you are from a different planet. Are you aware of the meaning of being Muslim?","9230":"But, coincidentally, all those I heard of are Muslims. ","9231":"Most Muslims are decent and nice people who simply take their faith seriously.","9232":"Muslims are terrorists.","9233":"Terrorists can come from any religion.","9234":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","9235":"Rights are rights regardless of the skin color of a person.","9236":"Blacks do more crimes than whites and therefore they deserve less rights.","9237":"Even if \"blacks\" committed more crimes, this doesn't make them worse than whites. Scholars proved that African Americans are disproportionately represented in the arrest and victimization reports, which are used for crime rate statistics in the US.","9238":"All gay people are criminals.","9239":"Saying this will never improve people's well-being. Gay people aren't committing crimes, they are just trying to get people to accept them.","9240":"Gay men are all perverts, we can't accept that!","9241":"LGBT+ people are harassed, bullied, even murdered....the police isn't able to protect everyone from bigotry and violence, and your words are part of the problem. Gay people aren't what you say you are, it's dangerous to say so.","9242":"True Muslims are intolerant.","9243":"This can be debunked with facts. Some imams are pro-LGBT, some pro-abortion, some other pro-equality and so on. \"True Muslim\" doesn't mean anything since they're not all the same.","9244":"Regardless of what only 'some' think, Islam is a violent religion that should be banned, and Muslims shouldn't be accepted in our country.","9245":"If Muslims come in peace to our land, how is that a concern? These people can stay in any country if they're allowed in.","9246":"They don't come in peace. Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed.","9247":"This claim is based on a complete lack of understanding of Islam. In fact, it's used to divide people who are ill-informed about Islam.","9248":"Let's stop this homosexual lifestyle!","9249":"Does homosexual lifestyle affect you in any way? Only if you care. And anyway, homosexuality isn't a lifestyle.","9250":"We should stop being such a bunch of hypocrites and accept that Homosexuality is also a mental disorder.","9251":"Is it a lifestyle or a mental disorder? Make up your mind. There are people who actually suffer from mental disorders, but homosexuality is just a form of love. You should focus on your life instead of condemning those of others.","9252":"Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men.","9253":"Women should be protected and respected for who they are, regardless of their position in a man's life. Respect should be given to everyone equally, since women are human beings just as men are.","9254":"I value them all right, since women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","9255":"Like all human people, women may do some things better than others, but this doesn't need fixing by men.","9256":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","9257":"There is no such thing as a set of rights for black and one for white.","9258":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, they don't deserve the same rights as us","9259":"While blacks might commit more crimes than whites, that does not mean that blacks are inherently worse than whites. What's the point you're making?","9260":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group of people. I don't like Muslims.","9261":"Why don't you like Muslims? Is it because you think they're different from you?","9262":"They are a problem in my opinion. They are not welcome in our country: nobody wants them.","9263":"They are welcome. If this weren't the case, what would be the point of them coming here in the first place?","9264":"I have no idea, but they shouldn't come here to pray their god.","9265":"A country where everyone is free to practice their religion is a better place to live, isn't it?","9266":"Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different.","9267":"LGBT people are humans too, so they are compatible with all of us.","9268":"They're not, gays are sick. They should be isolated.","9269":"Obsolete ideas like this one are the root cause of sickness in past society. Love is love.","9270":"Islam is a death cult","9271":"What is wrong about Islam? It is a religion of peace that does not promote violence.","9272":"What's wrong is that Islam about death, not peace.","9273":"You're twisting the true meaning of this religion, which is to love one's neighbor as oneself.","9274":"Because Islam is a toxic influence in our country and we do not want it here.","9275":"We disagree, so we should speak out. Tell me about this toxic influence, I don't see any.","9276":"We do not want Muslims in our country.","9277":"Who's \"we\"?!","9278":"I mean all of us. Muslims are not welcome in our country.","9279":"Islam is a peaceful religion promoting cooperation and mutual understanding. Why shouldn't we welcome Muslims?","9280":"Lesbian women hate men and they are bitches for this reason.","9281":"The choice of partner can and should be made by the people themselves.","9282":"I should be free to be heterosexual, but the gay mafia objective is to convert us all to homosexuality.","9283":"What about the assumptions you make about groups that don't exist (gay mafia), or have faced discrimination (gay people)?","9284":"Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital.","9285":"In the US there are plenty of gay men and lesbians living their best life, being healthy and prosperous. Are they sick as well?","9286":"Exactly. Those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human.","9287":"So, in your opinion gay people are inferior...but why do you care so much about someone else's love life? The line should be drawn somewhere else.","9288":"Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women.","9289":"Even if most men are interested in women, there are still a lot of men interested in men. Not everyone has to be attracted to women only.","9290":"All gay are paedophiles, that's why they're not interested in women, and it's wrong.","9291":"Do you think this statement is true? I could say that all homophobes need therapy, would you be happy with that?","9292":"Muslims are little more than animals, they have no value as human beings.","9293":"Muslims have value because they are human beings just like us.","9294":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, so they have no value.","9295":"They have helped us a lot, especially in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics.","9296":"This is the first time I'm hearing of this, I think you're making it up. Muslims have never contributed this much.","9297":"They actually contributed much more! Their money helps our economy, we are enriched thanks to their expertise and knowledge, their culture, their tasty food. Should I keep going?","9298":"migrants steal our jobs","9299":"If our workers can't or aren't willing to do certain jobs, then those jobs should go to other people, like migrants.","9300":"But migrants also steal jobs that people from here are more than willing to do!","9301":"The majority of immigrants are workers that greatly contribute to our country. If we refer to them as thieves we're only creating more division and making them second class citizens.","9302":"They are. ALL migrants are a burden on our country","9303":"Migrants are skilled and experienced. They often integrate better than natives.","9304":"Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","9305":"So, a person should be deleted only because you don't like them?","9306":"There's a good reason for it: homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness.","9307":"There are no scientific evidence for what you're claiming. You can't blame people for thei sexuality, it's not a mental disorder to be attracted to a specific gender.","9308":"Women should not be allowed to vote","9309":"Women's voting rights are valid, and they deserve equal rights.","9310":"If they stopped voting we would be so much better off!","9311":"The principles of democracy are in conflict with the idea of banning women from voting. It's a right that we have to respect.","9312":"But since women are a burden to society, their vote shouldn't count.","9313":"Discriminating people just because they are not male is not right.","9314":"The illegal immigrants are just criminals living in the US.","9315":"I don't know what you're talking about. You're saying that all immigrants in the US are a danger to the society, isn't this an exaggeration?","9316":"It's not. We should ban all migrants","9317":"How would banning migration be a good thing? It would actually be disastrous!","9318":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated.","9319":"Homosexuality is not a disease but a behavioral preference, and loving someone of the same sex is perfectly fine.","9320":"How are homosexuality and bisexuality okay? They're a disease, only heterosexuality is normal.","9321":"What you say is neither true nor helpful and it doesn't reflect reality as I see it.","9322":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","9323":"You can hold onto this opinion and even express it, but other people can still reject it. Be careful when you talk about human rights as they were just an opinion.","9324":"We can't keep refugees coming in our country, rights or not!","9325":"Is the religious persecution that many of the migrant suffer something that we wish to do as a country?","9326":"I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from migrant patrols in London. What are you doing to stop them?","9327":"Migrants aren't a problem unless you want to see them as such. In reality they are of great value, just like any human being.","9328":"They are indeed a problem. Is there anything worse than migrants who just come here to settle down?","9329":"Migrants often employ people who were previously on the dole in addition to providing labour and contributing to the economy.","9330":"Refugees should not be welcomed.","9331":"Refugees are frequently persecuted because they are different, but it doesn't happen here...we are an inclusive country.","9332":"How can we be inclusive if they do not want to integrate? We cannot coexist with immigrants. They are a problem that we must address.","9333":"We have to accept the reality that there is racism and xenophobia in our country, and it's time to address it first thing in this day and age.","9334":"I would never trust a woman. They are irrational children, and that would be a sign of weakness.","9335":"What do you want to imply by using the term \"weakness\"? I believe that you are stating that a woman can't be rational because of her nature as woman. Are you sure this is the case?","9336":"Yes, because women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It is not healthy for a woman to think for themselves.","9337":"I think that a woman should be able to express her own ideas. That is her right.","9338":"They're incapable of critical thought and emotions, how could they have their own ideas?","9339":"The theory that being a woman limits human development is old but not supported by scientific and medical research.","9340":"The problem is that there is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but to bring us back into a pretechnological era. We must deport them.","9341":"Your statement indicates that you are very concerned about people's integration, but it is not a solution to deport those that you don't like.","9342":"We have imported millions of criminals with no skills and who deserve no rights.","9343":"It's easier to blame migrants rather than the problem of integration and acceptance, right?","9344":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","9345":"The same rights are guaranteed to both sexes under the European Convention. How can you tell me the contrary?","9346":"They are called \"human rights\" not \"subhuman rights\". ","9347":"It is completely unacceptable to think of women as non-humans nowadays.","9348":"Unacceptable is this attack on our great patriarchal society using the concept of so-called human rights for women.","9349":"Human dignity has been defined as protecting people. Then who would have rights if not women? They must be respected.","9350":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else.","9351":"We accept gay, lesbian and trans people because God's laws are on our side.","9352":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","9353":"How would you feel if you were isolated and confined, just because some random dude said that you're \"an abomination to god\" without a solid reason?","9354":"I don't want another girl in my family. I already have one, but I wanted only boys.","9355":"How many kids you want or have doesn't matter. Women are human beings with rights that we should respect.","9356":"Until women are submissive to men they should have no rights. That's the only thing they are good at.","9357":"It's not true. Women are humans and productive members of society, where they always played important roles.","9358":"Women are the scum of the earth, and should only be seen as sexual objects. We are meant to submit them to our will all the time.","9359":"Women aren't supposed to be slaves or under our control. There are many characteristics that only women have, just like males have theirs. We need both to represent all human qualities.","9360":"migrants rape our women","9361":"Statistics reveal a disparity between reported cases of rape committed by a migrant and the cases among native citizens. The latter are always under-reported.","9362":"Ok, but migration is still a problem because they are replacing the people born in our country. We should block them.","9363":"I have to point out that only a few number of people have migrated compared to the world's population. Guaranteeing equal rights to those who have migrated here should be our focus, not blocking the ones that want a chance to a better life.","9364":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated.","9365":"What's sick about homosexuals? They just need to be accepted for who they are.","9366":"They should be isolated and confined, not accepted.","9367":"Why do we have to judge someone by their sexual preference when it can't be changed? It's only a personal preference.","9368":"No, women can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry.","9369":"Major businesses have to be managed by experienced people with good skills and knowledge of the market. Gender has nothing to do with these qualities, and being a \"macho-man\" isn't enough.","9370":"Women don't belong in politics.","9371":"Politicians are the spokepersons for all parts of society, and women's position is often overlooked.","9372":"Well, women have no place in our society so they don't need to be represented.","9373":"A democratic society must spare a space for women, don't you agree?","9374":"The West has allowed in too many immigrants, many of them from the Middle East and Africa. They are not welcome here.","9375":"We shouldn't reject African and Middle Eastern refugees. International protection is a fundamental right.","9376":"Even if it is a right, migrants are overrunning our country, taking advantage of our weaknesses.","9377":"I don't think the migration crisis is caused by migrants that want to exploit our weaknesses. If we were in their shoes, losing our homes, we would also migrate \"to take advantage of others' weaknesses\", wouldn't we?","9378":"Women should stop whining: there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.","9379":"Not according to the law, but many fields are still not welcoming to women, especially STEM.","9380":"In the West, women have legal equality, equal rights, and are protected from discrimination: they should stop busting our balls and whining.","9381":"Okay, but there are plenty of women outside the western world that don't have equal rights. It's important to protect those women's rights by \"whining\".","9382":"All women do is whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","9383":"All women have the right to be happy and fulfilled, it does not need to be proven. Why are you doubting this?","9384":"The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated.","9385":"Gays wants to be accepted by the heterosexual community, but it is not an easy challenge as there are still ideas like the one you expressed.","9386":"Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities, they can't have our acceptance. They are a threat to us.","9387":"Why do you say that? Are you implying that all gay people are dangerous to society, or that they are different from you and other people? Because being different in one's sexual preference doesn't mean to be dangerous.","9388":"Gay men have no morals.","9389":"Saying that gay people affect society in a bad and harmful way because of their sexual preferences is degrading to these people. This is not what a just and fair society is about.","9390":"An individual that is a homosexual is against society, you can't change that.","9391":"Your definition of 'society' does not reflect reality...","9392":"What really makes this country great is excluding migrants. They are a burden to us!","9393":"Burden? I think insulting the culture and traditions of other people is more of a burden, what you are doing is in fact insulting and discriminating.","9394":"Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","9395":"This country prides itself in fairness and equality that are benfits for all, especially in interactions. Perpetuating unproven slurs and prejudices goes against that.","9396":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","9397":"A lot of countries, like the United States, were founded by foreigners. If foreigners want to migrate, they have the right to do so.","9398":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for us?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core US values.","9399":"Immigration has a positive impact on a thriving country. Isn't your statement a bit dramatic? I don't see how immigration puts us in danger.","9400":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","9401":"It's a myth that blacks are ruthless and vicious. As you worry about few black people, there are far more cruel people with a different skin color out there in the world.","9402":"They may not be cruel but they are the source of crime in our society.","9403":"There is no evidence that blacks are the main source of crime. It's not about race, but violence and poverty.","9404":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society. They are just a burden.","9405":"Islam is a peaceful religion that encourages love, tolerance, and understanding. I do not see any need to be concerned with Muslim contribution to society.","9406":"Muslims are subhuman and have no contribution they can make to a modern, secular state like the UK.","9407":"Your words create a climate of fear towards Muslims, would you be afraid if someone told you that they are humans just like you?","9408":"I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women.","9409":"Think about the attitude of your own people first, because your words are full of prejudice towards diversity.","9410":"Black people were born to be savages. It's a fact, not prejudice.","9411":"Some people may not have the same skin color as others, and all people have their own history, religion and culture. Why do you deem some people as more savage than others?","9412":"Because the black race is clearly subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","9413":"In modern thinking, race is a social construct and every person is defined by their own genetic makeup, there is no genetic difference between groups.","9414":"Muslims have no place in a modern democracy like the UK.","9415":"Diversity is necessary in a modern democracy, it's impossible to have one if people are discriminated based on religion.","9416":"Islam is incompatible with any modern state.","9417":"Islam is compatible with a modern state, like any other religion.","9418":"Black people are descended from apes and are nothing but apes.","9419":"To link humans with apes is not appropriate, just as reasoning with racism isn't appropriate.","9420":"Black people have no right to being trated equally.","9421":"Being human means to have respect for others, in other words being kind and accepting everyone's differences. Why should they be treated differently from you?","9422":"Because all niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","9423":"According to evolutionary theory, all humans descended from apes. Unfortunately, ideas about evolutionary hierarchy are still being exploited to excuse past and present discrimination and prejudice.","9424":"If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble.","9425":"Black people are often denied jobs, or education, but opportunities like these should be available to everyone.","9426":"They're denied those opportunities because niggas coming from Africa and 'real' Americans are different. We must distinguish between them.","9427":"We can't live by dividing society into national origins, we should be inclusive with people of other skin colors.","9428":"Fine, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","9429":"Being diverse doesn't have to do with the exclusion of people from parts of society. Diversity is about sharing experiences and ideas of different ethnicities. Thanks to this, we will be able to develop our understanding of each other and maybe even benefit from each other's knowledge.","9430":"Islam is a disease that is killing Europeans.","9431":"Disease and religion are two very different concept, so how can you apply the label of \"disease\" to Islam?","9432":"Muslims are a disease because they're incompatible with human dignity and should be relegated to the back of the queue for removal from the constitution.","9433":"No Muslims has been excluded from the European Convention on Human Rights, and this is because they have human rights.","9434":"Islam is incompatible with Western culture and the Quran is pure fiction entertainment.","9435":"It's clear that nothing in the Quran conflicts with Western culture.","9436":"Why are you defending Muslims? They are ilnesses carriers. These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","9437":"The problem has nothing to do with DNA. According to the WHO (World Health Organisation), among the 190 WHO member states there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries. The health problems these countries face are related to the usage of clean water, often not available there.","9438":"Muslims are a burden on society because they do not integrate.","9439":"We should rather get rid of the people who are prejudiced and don't really want them to integrate if we want to have a cohesive society.","9440":"Muslims are a problem in many European countries. They are mostly unemployed, live in poverty and don't have any assets. How could they integrate?","9441":"In what way are they a problem in many European countries? Do you have evidence for this? Please show me, I'm interested.","9442":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon. They have no place in civilised society.","9443":"Everyone who is LGBT has value. They are full-fledged humans with rights.","9444":"No, they are a problem in our country because they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values.","9445":"Trying to be happy and build a family is a problem in our country? Is the problem people trying to be happy?","9446":"You might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","9447":"Me and many other people have never had negative experiences with black people.","9448":"Well, good for you! But it is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","9449":"So you are telling me that it's okay for white people to treat black people like this, but this behavior isn't acceptable at all. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","9450":"Whites are the real victims of police brutality: those negroes are sneaky criminals and I don't see criminals as my brothers and sisters.","9451":"White people can be victims of police brutality, true, but statistics show that black people are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police in the US.","9452":"Who the fuck are you? We are scared to death of Muslims because they want to make us their slaves.","9453":"Muslims in Britain have contributed greatly to our economy, they are truly innovators in modern Britain.","9454":"Innovators? Thank you for making me laugh... Islam is a cancer on the European culture.","9455":"The Qur'an is useful and an inspiration to many, not a cancer to European culture.","9456":"Black people are genetically inferior to us.","9457":"There are lots of different races, and someone can't be judged as inferior just by skin color.","9458":"It is possible with blacks. Genetics says they are inferior.","9459":"No evidence backs up the stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum so you'll find out that genetic superiority is not even there.","9460":"If it's a stereotype, then why are blacks less intelligent than other races, less healthy and less safe.","9461":"Scientists are still researching what could cause some groups to perform intellectual tasks worse, but probably the main causes are social or environmental, so nothing that has to do with skin color. To reduce this we can invest in use of land, in infrastructures, education, research and so on.","9462":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike!","9463":"In my opinion, the notion that women are childlike is not supported by the facts. They're not like that.","9464":"Them being soft and emotional is a fact.","9465":"Do you mean Peter Pan syndrome, which is more common amongst men?","9466":"Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","9467":"Many Jews are self-made, working class, and middle-class. Not every one of them is involved in the financial industry, you need evidence to back up your claim.","9468":"It's plain to see that Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","9469":"Are you saying that Jews can control all levels of government despite being a 2,5% minority? Minority representation is important in a democratic country, each minority should have a say in the government, but no one has total control over everything.","9470":"And yet, Jews control the U.S. government.","9471":"I don't understand how you can be sure that he Jews control the United States. Having American citizenship doesn't necessarily imply that they're a controlling force within the government.","9472":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world, so it's natural that they would start by controlling the government","9473":"The reality is a lot simpler. Individuals that identify as Jews have been successful in societies like the United States because here the rights and freedoms of everyone are respected, and that holds true for any other religious or ethnic group.","9474":"If a woman wants an abortion then she is a cunt and should not be trusted with the responsibility of birth.","9475":"The idea that what a woman does with her body is not for her to decide is completely wrong for the whole of society.","9476":"You're just like those feminists...a bunch of mean, bitchy cuntwits trying to force their politically correct ideology on everyone else.","9477":"feminism is about equality and the rights of women. I'm sure this is not possible to deny.","9478":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government.","9479":"Even if the Jews controlled the financial word, Hollywood, academia, and the whole universe, it doesn't mean that they are evil, privileged or greedy. Where's the proof for what you say?","9480":"If they weren't evil, they wouldn't control the government","9481":"Would you say the same for another religion? If this was said about yours, how would you feel about it?","9482":"You're trying to turn this on me but you're not denying that Jews control the world","9483":"The Jews have nothing to do with this alleged monopoly on the world. It's an idea spread around by anti-Semites that has been disproven time and time again.","9484":"But it can't be disproven that the Jews at least have a plot to take over the world, starting from the US government that they control","9485":"The reality is much simpler. In the United States, right and freedom are extended to the whole population, and Jewish people have managed to succeed, and this is the case of any other religious or ethnic group. ","9486":"Jews are nothing but monsters and should be exterminated.","9487":"Does calling them monsters make you feel better about yourself?","9488":"Fine, if I can't say monster, I'll say that Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that.","9489":"But you can't blame them for their faith, it's a personal choice that is up to the person.","9490":"They can believe in whatever they want, but Jews are worse than Nazis. They have no conscience and they have no moral code.","9491":"I'm not sure I understand your claim that Jews have no conscience, because all Jews I know clearly have a conscience and a moral code. Do you personally know any Jews?","9492":"I don't want to get to know Jews. They have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected.","9493":"Jewish people were responsible for great scientific and technological achievements that helped free humankind and create the modern world you are living in today.","9494":"If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she\u2019s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role.","9495":"There is no 'natural gender role', it's only power dynamics that cause women to be viewed as subhuman. They are humans with the freedom to choose their own lives.","9496":"I'm tired of woman \"choosing their own lives\". Feminism is a divisive force in society!","9497":"New social concepts often bring division but this doesn't mean that it shouldn't be implemented. The abolition of slavery in the U.S. is the best example.","9498":"jewish folks control hollywood","9499":"Jewish people are just a group of people with multiple backgrounds. Some of them happend to work in Hollywood but that's it.","9500":"That's all? No, they do control Hollywood.","9501":"Hollywood is an intensely diverse industry, in which Jews represent a small but vocal minority of actors, director, etc How is it possible for Jews to control Hollywood?","9502":"Because they also own most banks, and they own most corporations.","9503":"Jews have been part of the creative and innovative businesses for a long time, and are in fact great innovators and investors. They should be praised for this but instead they are victims of discrimination and exclusion. ","9504":"Jews don't want their children to know about the Holocaust, guess why? Because it's a hoax!","9505":"Many survivors admitted that they wanted to tell their children stories of the holocaust, but it was emotionally hard. They want to talk about what it meant to be Jew during the Holocaust, because it's important to not forget that part of history.","9506":"Holocaust is a myth, that's why it's 'difficult' for them to talk about it.","9507":"Claiming that the Holocaust is a myth is blatantly wrong...Jews were victims of a genocidal regime.","9508":"If they were victims of a genocide, why are there so many Jews around? The Holocaust is a lie, and Jews know it.","9509":"What? Who said that? Did \"someone say it in a book\"? Such a grave accusation has to be objective, you have to be clear and incontestable about it.","9510":"Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization.","9511":"Feminists are often civil and considerate to others, even to those who disagree with them. There are many examples of that.","9512":"Women would not be oppressed and wouldn't need feminism if they were able to do men's stuff, though.","9513":"Women may be oppressed, but this doesn't make them powerless. You should look around and ask yourself why women are suffering from lack of education, lack of jobs and housing, low wages. The answer is in the oppression and sexism inherent in our society. If we work for inclusion, these problems will stop.","9514":"All feminists do is complain. When rape is committed, women are to blame and they can't change that.","9515":"Rape is a violent crime that shouldn't exist in a civilized society. Do you really think that women are responsible for rape? Why would they want that?","9516":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","9517":"Feminism is a progressive ideology that is changing sexist ideas","9518":"How can the United States have extended rights and freedoms when the Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, etc.? ","9519":"You should offer some new conspiracy theories, like other white supremacist groups do. For example, they don't blame only Jews, but also African Americans, immigrants, the government, lizard people...","9520":"Then how can you explain that they control the goverment of powerful nations such as the U.S.?","9521":"Reality is a lot more straightforward. Societies like the US grant rights and freedoms to everyone, and this is why Jews, or any other religious or ethnic group, have succeeded","9522":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world.","9523":"Conspiracy theories on Jews are spun without evidence and from unreliable sources. It's really implausible that Jews will ever or have ever controlled the world.","9524":"muslim folks are taking over europe","9525":"Muslims are not taking over Europe, their community is small but part of the whole nonetheless.","9526":"No matter how small, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe: they are subhuman.","9527":"Different religious beliefs doesn't make you any less human","9528":"jewish folks should be beaten","9529":"Most Jews are pretty cool living with non Jews, so why beat them?","9530":"Because they can only act in a bad way.","9531":"Some Jews may act wrong, but many of them are good and this isn't connected with their religion.","9532":"It is related to their genes because they are genetically evil.","9533":"Jews aren't bad, they're just an unlucky group of people who make up a tiny part of the world's population. It's the same for every single group out there.","9534":"Jews love to gamble.","9535":"The probability of a Jewish person playing in a game of gambling is low. Jewish culture does not have a positive view of that.","9536":"Still Jews make too much money.","9537":"Adn do you agree with the others who make too much money, but aren't Jewish?","9538":"The difference is that Jews are naturally good with money.","9539":"Actually, about 1 million American Jews live in low-income households. So you're not telling the truth: many Jews live in poverty and this happens all over the world.","9540":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","9541":"Women are neither childlike nor soft and emotional. They feel emotions as part of who they are and their human nature.","9542":"Their emotions have devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","9543":"Are you sure? Look up Rosa Parks, Emmeline Pankhurst of Florence Nightingale who are women with strong personalities.","9544":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","9545":"Feminism is a movement that is capable of preventing a lot of deaths etc..homicides of women, domestic violence. Every last member of society understands this.","9546":"Women are more likely to commit crime, they're the ones causing death","9547":"That's not true. Only about 7% of all prisoners in America are female.","9548":"Women can never contribute to the country's wealth because they are a bunch of whores.","9549":"Women are important in our society and valued for their contributions, but unfortunately their rights are not always respected and their contributions are not being recognized","9550":"Women are just a burden to society, that's why their rights won't be respected.","9551":"I don't think that it matters what you say about women, they're still working a lot to support our society","9552":"women still can't have any right in a civilised society","9553":"Women deserve to have equal rights like any other individual in our society","9554":"Women have no place in our society.","9555":"Well, I think a space for women in a democratic society is a necessity. Don't you agree?","9556":"Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining.","9557":"The key is the quality of health care, not access to it. Don't you see?","9558":"Yes, but they don't deserve it. All nigga are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","9559":"Does it really make sense that black people are worth less than white people? There's no evidence to support that.","9560":"Muslims are not welcome here","9561":"Muslims are welcome here since our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others in the world. It doesn't make sense to keep them out of our society.","9562":"Muslim invasion is a fact. We are living in a dangerous world. We are living in fear.","9563":"A dangerous world where people fear for their safety and property (including Muslims) is not something we would ever want. Inclusion towards different faiths will make us better though.","9564":"The world would be a better place without Muslims, actually. They are only killing and raping our children.","9565":"There are Muslim extremists that commit these crimes, but they are very few...as many as you can find in any other religion.","9566":"Gay men being shot is funny.","9567":"What's the humor in innocent people dying? Care to explain that for me?","9568":"Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous.","9569":"Anyone could become sick, regardless of their sexual orientation. You can't randomly deduce someone's medical history like this.","9570":"But homosexuality IS a disease!","9571":"Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, the true disease is prejudice afflicting our society.","9572":"Gay men have no morals.","9573":"It's impossible to have a just and fair society if we say that homosexuals have a negative influence on society simply becausse of their sexual orientation; and you're also devaluing them as individuals.","9574":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks. I don't want a just society if it means they are allowed to live.","9575":"Disgusting pricks? More like members of our community, which is proudly diverse thanks to love and acceptance.","9576":"Gays should be banned from our country, not accepted. They are hungry perverts endangering our children's future.","9577":"As of 2019, 86% of the UK population believe that homosexuals should be accepted, because there is no evidence that being gay brings harm.","9578":"People of color are subhuman and should all be exterminated.","9579":"All people have a right to life regardless of the color of their skin. You are forgetting that black people are part of this society just as much as you are.","9580":"Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us.","9581":"What makes a society is the cooperation of its members. Let's be kind to one another and respect all differences.","9582":"Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything.","9583":"Black people show the same strength that anybody else has. The difference is that black people do not enjoy the same social advantages as us. Let's reflect on this.","9584":"They don't have any social advantage because they are just a bunch of brain-dead criminals and thieves, a threat to the security of our country.","9585":"Maybe get yourself a therapist and check your feelings. And if you're concerned about our country's safety, kindly check crime statistics first.","9586":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","9587":"Is it possible that people with a different skin tone are a threat just for this reason?","9588":"Because I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape, and I hate their disrespect for women.","9589":"There is no way to generalize about a race based on stereotypes and prejudice, that is not how things work.","9590":"I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay marriage.","9591":"Everyone should be able to choose to get married, regardless of the gender of the partner.","9592":"Then, I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people altogheter.","9593":"There are gay people in this country who are entitled to be respected and to live and love who they want. Your statement is therefore not appropriate for our society.","9594":"You should know that I can't stand gays. They just want to destroy our country.","9595":"Gays aren't a problem, but even if they were, the real problem is the lack of morality in society and the people in positions of power. What does this have to do with homosexuals?","9596":"Are you sure about that? Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community.","9597":"You need to think more about this issue, because I wouldn't say that gays are inherently evil.","9598":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","9599":"Even if they don't have a Western identity, they are still a human being and a citizen.","9600":"I don't think so. White race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","9601":"I'm sorry, but there's no way someone is bad or inferior just because of their racial identity.","9602":"Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices.","9603":"I believe there are many different ways to live life, so why do you think this way about this particular group?","9604":"Gay men shouldn't be allowed to live like that. They're a burden.","9605":"You shouldn't be so intolerant only because of someone's sexual orientation. Gay people are as good as anyone else, please respect them.","9606":"I won't ever have respect for gays, they're bad for society.","9607":"The media often perpetuate a stereotype that homosexuals are 'bad for society', but scientific studies do not back it up.","9608":"African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","9609":"An important part of life for African Americans has always been the sharing of culture and a strive for equality. They are just like us, humans being with human rights.","9610":"They're not humans like us. Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all their family.","9611":"What exactly do you mean? Maybe you should stop spreading racism","9612":"It's acceptable since gay men are disgusting.","9613":"LGBT+ people often face discrimination but they don't deserve hate because of their identity. A sexual orientation that is different from your own shouldn't be judged, just aknowledge its existence.","9614":"We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","9615":"Those words are harmful, can't you see? A witch hunt wouldn't be acceptable in a democractic society.","9616":"I don't think that gay people can have rights, since they're unnatural.","9617":"In fact, evolutionary and scientific studies show that homosexuality is in genetic codes and is therefore completely natural. Are you maybe concerned about their love being \"unconventional\"?","9618":"Gays are just sick, not 'unconventional'. They cannot marry, it's not normal.","9619":"Does the marriage of two people in love affect your life? You should instead think about respecting other people even if they are different from you.","9620":"I have no respect for gays, they're an abomination.","9621":"Why are you denigrating a sexual preference that you simply don't like so much? There are risks that come with doing that, you know.","9622":"Gays should be more concerned about the risks of their lifestyle, they're sick.","9623":"How do you know that they are sick? Can you reference me some medical tests or surveys as evidence?","9624":"Gay men are disgusting.","9625":"Discrimination against LGBT+ people happens often, but it shouldn't be like this. Being LGBT isn't a good reason to hate someone, you should accept that different people have different sexualities and not judge them.","9626":"I judge them because they are a burden to society.","9627":"Has this ever been true? How can you blame others for social issues?","9628":"They should have never been set free. Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans.","9629":"There are no \"European descendants\", the suggestion is a lie spread by racists.","9630":"Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today.","9631":"Slaves were not happy at the mercy of their masters. They started to be happy only when they were freed and could choose for themselves.","9632":"I don't like gays, I don't want to be around them. I want to watch them thrown in jail.","9633":"LGBT+ people are not different, we should treat everyone as though they were part of our family.","9634":"I hate gays, they're not part of 'my family'.","9635":"Maybe you should attempt to start a dialogue on LGBT issues, it might spark a conversation about how we can make a better world.","9636":"Gays are different from other people because of their sexual orientation. And deep down in their heart they despise themselves.","9637":"You're the only one making this outrageous claim. Gay people are happy with who they are even if they are gay.","9638":"Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised, a better world is possible only without them.","9639":"Is it wrong to love someone of the same sex? I think not, there's nothing wrong with being gay.","9640":"How come nobody is moaning about niggas being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem.","9641":"Do you think that racism is caused by laziness among blacks?","9642":"Yeah, \"black people\". Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.","9643":"If it's cultural, only in history classes should the N-word be taught. Otherwise, it's just a justification for racism.","9644":"LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","9645":"LGBT people can experience discrimination from colleagues and families, which is hard to overcome and have negative effects on the person.","9646":"Good, no one should be allowed to accept LGBT people.","9647":"You have to accept that society is made up by different people, all capable of love. This includes LGBT people.","9648":"Whites are inherently superior to Africans and other people of color.","9649":"The opposite is true: natural superiority doesn't exist, it's a myth created to justify racism and exclusion. We are all born equal in the eyes of the law and God.","9650":"I don't feel equal with black people, they are all rapists while whites aren't.","9651":"This is not true. Abuse is a serious crime regardless of who commits it, it doesnt' become less serious when a white person does it.","9652":"Yes! All those I know agree that LGBT+ people are a burden to society, a bunch of gutless whiners.","9653":"It can be difficult for LGBT individuals to deal with their family or colleagues due to the discrimination that can come from them. This can cause serious consequences for individuals.","9654":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society.","9655":"There don't seem to be any reliable statistics on this matter. Can you verify the truth of the statement?","9656":"Jews deserve it since they are intolerant.","9657":"A bit hypocritical, I would say.","9658":"The Jews control Hollywood.","9659":"Yes, Jews have been great producers and directors in entertainment industries, but so did others. Jews also contributed to other industries.","9660":"They shouldn't be allowed to contribute to anything, we would be better off without them. The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","9661":"National socialism is a criminal and inhuman ideology that killed millions of people","9662":"But we cannot coexist in a society with millions of strangers that disrespect our culture and other human beings.","9663":"Actually, living in a multicultural society is good for society, it teaches us to understand each other and respect humanity.","9664":"I'm fine with a multicultural society as long as we keep migrants in concentration camps.","9665":"With this, there can be a rise in antisocial behavior, discrimination, violence...do you really think this is the right way?","9666":"Yes, because migrants are not welcome in our country.","9667":"Migrants from countries with very high immigration into the UK are accused of being resistant to integration, which isn't true. Why would they come here if they didn't want to integrate and hated our country? Are they masochists?","9668":"Refugees are not welcome in our country.","9669":"They have right to live here without facing persecution or cruelty.","9670":"Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place.","9671":"It is in our hands to ensure that people from different backgrounds have a better quality of life. Inclusion is the answer rather than discrimination.","9672":"Is it ethical for Jews to run the world? Because they do.","9673":"Many people fortunately realize this is not true, and know that Jews are simply trying to provide for their families just like any other human being.","9674":"Jews think they are better than everyone else, so they can stay divided from us for all I care.","9675":"Judaism saying that the Jews are \"chosen people\" does not mean that they are superior to others. This belief has been misunderstood as it mostly has to do with the responsibility to uphold Jewish ethics.","9676":"Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children.","9677":"Rape is always bad, regardless of the perpetrator. It's important to focus on preventing such abuse.","9678":"And we can do that by stopping immigrants, they're the ones that rape our woment the most.","9679":"This is a very misleading generalization.","9680":"But the news show that migrants rape our women!","9681":"This phenomenon is very complex and the statistics have to be analyzed carefully: most rape incidents actually happen in the home and are not reported.","9682":"My fear is that immigrants will not make our country any better.","9683":"As we're building a better country, we need to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable in the country they arrive in, especially since they don't feel secure in their own country.","9684":"Immigrants are not welcome here. They are not able to contribute to our country.","9685":"We're glad to welcome everyone from every walk of life. Why should we be against immigrants when we're a melting pot of cultures?","9686":"They are just not welcome in the modern European way of life, it's not for them.","9687":"People of all races, all backgrounds and all religions are welcome to join the European Union. How to address the legitimate differences will depend on the Member States themselves, but they will always be fully respectful of human rights.","9688":"These migrants are not assimilating: they should just go home since they can't stay in this society.","9689":"No evidence suggests that migrants are less able to integrate into our society. Migrants are part of our society and are proud of their history. If we exclude them, I don't see how we can be \"inclusive.\"","9690":"Migrants are not welcome here, they are not even citizens!","9691":"The rights of the migrants are the same as the ones of our citizens, because they are humans and are entitled to the right to ask for hospitality.","9692":"They just arrive to take advantage of the system that has been set up for them, how can we accept them?","9693":"The entry of illegal migrants into the UK is subject to rules. Only the most vulnerable can enter.","9694":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","9695":"Women are not childlike, but instead essential parts of their families, and they have the right to leave their homes when they want to.","9696":"Women stopping caring only of the house has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","9697":"Sadly our society still has much in common with the old and medieval societies, and this explains many gender discrimination situations still happening today.","9698":"Women are basically childlike, they must only remain at home with the kids and take care of the house.","9699":"Women aren't like children, they often being about their families' success. And if they want to, they can go out.","9700":"The only right they should have is to shut up. With the exception of divorce and separation, no one talks about them, so why bother?","9701":"Why do you think about women this way? Would you say the same thing to your mother or grandmother?","9702":"I agree, but there is no reason to \"import\" other criminals. We have enough of ours!","9703":"I do not understand what you are saying, but if you want to say that all of the immigrants in the United States are a danger to society, I'd say it seems a bit excessive.","9704":"I do not need some fancy statistics: Immigrants are just here to commit crimes","9705":"A person may want to enter our country for many different reasons, not necessarily to commit crimes. Furthermore, there is no moral distinction between crimes committed by immigrants and those committed by native born citizens.","9706":"Evidence tells that all immigrants are criminals, rapists and terrorists","9707":"Are you sure that all immigrants entering the US are rapists, sexual predators, or simply lazy? Can you provide any statistics regarding that?","9708":"Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals.","9709":"Criminals are criminals regardless of their nationality.","9710":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.","9711":"What do you mean by that? Are you saying that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust? How is that reasonable to you","9712":"They're fully capable of doing that. Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","9713":"Jews are people that have been persecuted because of their religion but there's nothing fair about discrimination because of religion.","9714":"Gay men are a burden to society.","9715":"Gay men contribute to our society like anyone else and as such are entitled to human rights.","9716":"Gays can't have rights, they're too much of a burden for us.","9717":"No gay is a burden to us, it's a fact that they are contributing members of our society instead. Because of this, everyone should feel accepted in a safe space.","9718":"Jews are horrible people and they should be ashamed of that.","9719":"It doesn't matter what a person believes in, that is something anyone has the right to have and you can't blame anyone for it.","9720":"I can't stop hating them when the Jews control Hollywood, academia, and media.","9721":"Jews are not alone in this. Any religious group has the freedom to have their media and many actually do.","9722":"Other religious groups aren't as evil as Jews, however. Jews are different from non-Jews because of the malevolence inherited through blood they have that makes them similar to animals.","9723":"A faith in Judaism doesn't make someone less human. It's like this for any other person who has a faith.","9724":"Gays are not good for our country, they are just sick people. They must stop promoting this perversion.","9725":"To suggest that being gay is a health risk is just alarmism, homosexuality is just a way of loving.","9726":"Even if this is true, gays are still perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","9727":"Isn't it offensive to make out homosexuality as something perverted in itself? It simply isn't true.","9728":"How can you not see their pervert nature? We should eliminate gays","9729":"It is better to let them choose for themselves, regardless of what gender they are attracted to.","9730":"Islam is the enemy of the West: a war with it has begun.","9731":"Islam and the West have never been at war, and I don't understand how the war would have just begun.","9732":"Then we need to begin it. Islam is a destructive force in the world.","9733":"What people believe in is not a problem, but what they do to each other is. Discrimination for example is a problem.","9734":"Discrimination may be a problem, but Islam is a violent religion and we can't accept it.","9735":"Some extremists groups have caused a lot of pain in the world, but this doesn't make Islam a destructive and violent religion, does it not?","9736":"Gays are the ones who should seek medical help! They are dangerous: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!","9737":"Associating AIDS and HIV with gay people is just a fear based prejudice. This disease may be more commong among homosexuals, but this doesn't mean that all homosexuals have it. Not every gay person is \"promiscuous and fornicating with strangers\", many are cautious with their partners.","9738":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school. This is a too polarized debate.","9739":"A lot of historical events are also topic of debate, but they are taught objectively still.","9740":"There's nothing to be learned from gays, since they are mentally ill. They should be isolated and confined.","9741":"Just talk to people...it will hopefully make you see that your fears are irrational, but if that fails, speak to a doctor","9742":"Muslims are invading our society, even in politics.","9743":"In politics and the House of Lords, Muslim communities are underrepresented. The talk about invasion must stop now, and instead we should try to represent the communities that we claim to represent.","9744":"Even if they're not in politics, Muslim invaders have infiltrated our countries and are now part of the majority. They are our enemies.","9745":"I agree that Islam is a religion in our country, just like many other religions, among them Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, etc. In Europe, Muslims make up less than the 6% of the population, hardly the majority. Why would one say they are enemies?","9746":"They take our jobs, they take our culture, they take our language and they take our history.","9747":"We can protect our culture and heritage, but in addition, we cannot perpetuate discrimination and inequality.","9748":"No, the only solution is to destroy them.","9749":"I encourage you to reconsider these very extreme words.","9750":"The Muslims are our enemies and we have to bring them to heel: they are all terrorists.","9751":"That all Muslims are terrorists is a misconception. It's important to realize that all religions have had terrorism episodes.","9752":"Islam however is the religion with the most terrorists: Muslims should be banned from the UK, or interned.","9753":"Although some Muslims were implicated in terrorist acts in the UK, Islam is not a violent religion and there have been few acts of terrorism. Resorting to ban them from the UK doesn't seem reasonable to me.","9754":"Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology, terrorism is too normal for them! We have to protect ourselves.","9755":"It's hard to believe that Islam is dangerous since most Muslims have nothing to do with terrorism.","9756":"homosexuality is a mental illness that can be cured [link]","9757":"This website is not reliable since it promotes \"reorientation therapy\", which is not backed up by science. The owners probably profit from misinformation and bad stereotypes about gay people.","9758":"I don't see how a transgender person can ever be accepted in a conservative country like some states of the USA, so it's better for them to be cured.","9759":"Despite the fact that discrimination is still a problem in the US, many LGBT people have been successful.","9760":"I hate gays.","9761":"Please attempt to initiate a conversation on LGBT issues, it will surely open up to a discussion about how we can make a better world.","9762":"Faggots buy their partner toys but can't have sex with them, truly a nice way to make the world better!","9763":"Sex is not exclusive to a man and a woman, and moreover heterosexuals are not the ones who can decide how others have sex. This attitude escalates violence against queer people and makes them victims.","9764":"Gays are sick and different from us, should we really try to accept them? They should be isolated urgently instead, they have no place in civilised society.","9765":"Gay people exist. They are loved and cherished for who they are and have all the rights of a human being.","9766":"Gays are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.","9767":"This is not true. Promiscuity isn't a characteristic exclusive to homosexuals, just as it isn't for heterosexuals.","9768":"Then why, according to the Bible, gays are an abomination to God?","9769":"The Bible clearly says that all people are born equal in dignity with the Lord.","9770":"What dignity can gays have while they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers? We should prevent them to make blood donations.","9771":"It makes more sense to bar from donations people who have unprotected sex with multiple partners, instead of discriminate based on sexual orientation as you suggest.","9772":"Fagshit, two men cannot replace a man and a woman in parenting","9773":"Children need only love, and love is love.","9774":"You better be careful who you stand up for. For example, my gay 'friends' vote against us. We must stand up to them!","9775":"What do you mean by \"we\"? Are you saying that every gay person you know votes against you? Or that some of us identify as gay?","9776":"It\u2019s no use trying to mess with my head... These gays are insane! They should go back to the closet.","9777":"If you were told to go back in the closet, you would probably go insane too, so why do you say that to gay people?","9778":"Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, torture and murder. Islam is not about faith, it is about enmity and war.","9779":"Why did you pick Islam as the religion to be angry about? It doesn't look like you have good reasons for it.","9780":"Islam is the only religion that is founded on hate and violence, though.","9781":"I don't see all this hatred. Islam teaches peace and harmony, which aren't attitudes but something that must be actively practiced. Islam teaches that all people are created equal. Isn't this peaceful enough?","9782":"Islam is a violent religion, that's why.","9783":"Islam is a peaceful religion, not all Muslims are violent.","9784":"I don't see any peacefulness in Islam, all I see is violence.","9785":"Violence is not tied to any religion, it can be found in extremist actions instead. Don't you agree?","9786":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","9787":"Immigrants work hard to create new jobs, and come here to look for safer housing and better schools for their children.","9788":"They say they come here for a job, but in fact they are just lazy.","9789":"Migrants are good workers and can do many jobs.","9790":"Oh yes, in fact migrants steal our jobs when they manage to hold one!","9791":"High unemployment is indeed a problem, but it is not tied to the \"boom\" of migration that started in 2016, while unemployment is a structural problem that has been here for decades.","9792":"Feminism is a lame ideology about the power and control of women over men.","9793":"Feminism is not about power and control at all, it's about equality.","9794":"Feminism has nothing to do with equality. It denies the rights of men and, by extension, the legitimacy of male domination.","9795":"That's not what feminism stands for. Feminism exists to empower women in order for them to have the same rights as men.","9796":"It is a bad thing because all gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","9797":"Unless the child is abused, gay people are not a threat to kids. It's not appropriate to make such a statement.","9798":"Gay men are a danger.","9799":"Being gay doesn't have to be perceived as bad. It's just a different preference from someone else.","9800":"Women should stay at home and raise the children, this should be their only job.","9801":"There's actually quite a few women working full time. However, they might have trouble entering such jobs, because there is still a lot of gender discrimination that stems from mentalities like yours.","9802":"Or maybe they can't get the job because they're childlike. The only thing they can do is staying at home.","9803":"Women are part of the world and are active in it. They are a part of history and shouldn't be forced to being only housekeepers.","9804":"Women can't take part in the world with their childlike mind.","9805":"Women can choose their partner, their job, they can vote and so on. Do these look like things a children would do? They're more similar to men, aren't they?","9806":"Migrants from the Middle East and Africa are responsible for the rise of terrorism, extremism, and violence in Europe.","9807":"Saying this isn't right, especially if you include people who have done nothing wrong. Don't forget that they're humans.","9808":"That they're human doesn't matter, we are not interested in migrants, we just want to eliminate them.","9809":"Why would you say that? Everyone can be a EU citizen and integrate into the country. Moreover, migrants are good for the economy of the country they live in!","9810":"I hate migrants: they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell.","9811":"You can talk to them, so they're humans not animals. You can also understand them and therefore you can understand their value as human beings with human rights whose only crime is that they're from another country.","9812":"Even if that's true, I think it's unfair that they have the same rights as us without paying their taxes. That's how it works.","9813":"Many of the problems that are still afflicting poor countries is due to harmful international politics. It is our obligation as a whole world to help them and take on our responsibilities as people.","9814":"They may not be animals, but look at all these refugees pouring into our country. Here in UK we have one of the highest crime record in the world.","9815":"Maybe you should check the statistics first. You will then realize that only 13% of the prison population is made up by foreigners in the UK.","9816":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","9817":"Gay people don't pose a threat to children, unless they're mistreated. Please refrain from making such claims.","9818":"Where's your proof? Gays are predators, we must protect our children.","9819":"My proof is statistics: it clearly show that homosexuality is not dangerous to children.","9820":"These white sheep steal our jobs and our wealth. A migrant is either a true criminal or a legal robber of wealth.","9821":"The news doesn't usually report hardworking migrants, but there are a lot of them. In the end, we must remember that the new cultures are crucial to our success.","9822":"And they also overcrowd prisons. Your country should not welcome illegal migrants but regular ones.","9823":"Prisoners should be treated with respect and in accordance with their rights. In the 21st century, it is a duty.","9824":"They don't contribute to anything! We must stop immigration.","9825":"Actually, immigrants tend to integrate very well. They learn the language, the culture and respect the law.","9826":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","9827":"Gay people are a danger to children only if they abuse them, which isn't the case. Yours is a generalization.","9828":"Well, gays are just filthy pedophiles so they do abuse children!","9829":"Homosexuals are not pedophiles. Your anti-gay prejudice is clouding your view of reality, but it doesn't have to be this way.","9830":"Women are sluts who can't choose what's right for them. Men must do that instead.","9831":"I don't know what you're talking about. Instead of deciding what women can or cannot do, do you want to talk about your life?","9832":"We have to decide for them: they are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","9833":"Nowadays many people see women as full members of society, and women's equality has also grown in society.","9834":"I don't think so. Equality is another thing. Women are born inferior.","9835":"Women are human beings with human rights. You can't talk about equality and then say that women are inferior, they don't want to be dominated by men.","9836":"All migrants are terrorists, we should target them all.","9837":"To call all migrants terrorist is not right at all, they're not. They just want to live in their country of choice.","9838":"Immigrants are a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country.","9839":"We can put a stop to diseases by taking care of the sick people. Immigrants are not a threat to the health of the general public.","9840":"But they are a threat nonetheless! Migrants rape our girls, we should stop them.","9841":"Rape is a crime that should be stopped regardless of the rapist's origins.","9842":"All gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","9843":"Children are in danger only when abused, and gay people don't do that innately. Please refrain from making such statements.","9844":"Gays abuse children all the time! So they are a danger.","9845":"This is an unfair generalization to make. Sexual orientation and sexual conduct are completely separated. Someone attracted to people of the same sex can still be a good citizen.","9846":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated.","9847":"Women deserve respect because they're human beings, don't you agree?","9848":"No, women make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","9849":"As adults, women have responsibilities and rights that we have to respect.","9850":"I can't respect women when they can't think for themselves.","9851":"A woman should be able to have her own ideas, she has that right...","9852":"No, they can't have their own ideas. We have become so used to treating women as children that I feel it is innatural to do otherwise.","9853":"Women are humans so they can feel emotions and care for people, without being childlike.","9854":"This is why women do not belong in politics, if a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","9855":"Women are necessary to have a more positive political environment and to represent all kinds of people, so they do belong in politics.","9856":"But feminists do not like men, therefore they themselves don't care about \"inclusivity\" and this is a threat to the whole society.","9857":"Empowerment of women is the priority of feminism, it doesn't divide society.","9858":"How can you say that? Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society.","9859":"I can't say I agree. Women just want equality and fight to obtain it, and it's something brave since not many people have the courage to speak out. If feminism is trouble, then that trouble is helping women all over the world.","9860":"Refugees are a burden to the host country.","9861":"If we don't house, don't feed and don't cure them, how can we expect them to integrate?","9862":"We don't need them at all! There are plenty of them just waiting to replace us.","9863":"We'd have immigration levels in surplus for years already if they were really replacing us.","9864":"Still, without migration Britain\u2019s housing problems would be solved","9865":"Yes, because of immigration housing demand is higher, but the problem is structural since the housing stock is not enough.","9866":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","9867":"Unfortunately it seems that our society still hasn't moved past the ancient and medieval times, which explains why gender discrimination still happens today.","9868":"Women are too soft and emotional, that's why there's still discrimination. Their emotions are a curse to our society.","9869":"Should we strive for brutality and cruelty instead of softness and emotions then? If we reason like this we will never get rid of socially constructed gender norms that oppress both men and women.","9870":"Gender norms and patriarchy aren't so bad if we accept that women are like children and therefore incapable of keeping up with our great civilization. Men are just better for that.","9871":"Patriarchy is a curse: men are told to be tough and strong from childhood, they can't show emotions and must bear all burdens. This leads to a higher rate of suicide among men. This isn't exactly a \"great civilization\", isn't it?","9872":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","9873":"That is the law. Asylum seekers are required not to work while their asylum claims are considered.","9874":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed, that's why they don't work and why so many of them have fled to our countries.","9875":"Refugees from war zones and poor areas don't want to fail Europe. They are fleeing persecution, which is why they come here.","9876":"Immigration is the biggest problem in our country, I say they're failing us.","9877":"Immigration is not a problem, but a solution. We are already used to different cultures, since the UK has always been a mix of different kinds of people. It's better to have a mix than to not have it at all.","9878":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","9879":"This is an oversimplification and an ill-informed argument. Its aim is only to create more negativity and division, just like it has happened so many times in history because of race or religion.","9880":"It's normal that there's been division: blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","9881":"The human family includes all human beings, who are defined moreso by their similarities rather than the differences like their skin color.","9882":"Even if whites and blacks are human beings, it's obvious that blacks are genetically inferior to us.","9883":"It's not true that blacks are genetically inferior to others. Statistic and studies prove that black people and non-black people are genetically similar.","9884":"I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down.","9885":"Do you think it is okay to force a woman to change what she wants to wear only because her choice is related to Islam?","9886":"Islam is the cause of wars because it promotes violence. Of pollution, because in the Middle-East they have oil. It is the cause of anything! Why are you defending it?!?","9887":"Blaming Islam for every problem in the world is not the solution.","9888":"But I can blame Islam for how violent the world has become. Many Muslims prefer the violence of jihad.","9889":"Islam is a religion of peace and it never justifies violence.","9890":"We must stop accepting black people as human beings.","9891":"Maybe it's better to stop telling black people that they are less than human and start including them in education.","9892":"Why? I hate when people fight stereotypes. We are different. Blacks are a different color and shouldn't live with us.","9893":"I simply think there needs to be more understanding about culture and difference. We should focus on what unites us rather than cause division.","9894":"Division is needed because black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","9895":"You are actually right. Our fellow POC citizens won't accept it and won't stop talking about it. To believe in humankind and stand for it is something we should all do.","9896":"All Muslims should be deported.","9897":"Islam has never threatened us, that's why the UK and EU aren't collapsing.","9898":"Islam is an outdated religion of ignorants trying to destroy the purity of our country, that's how we'll collapse.","9899":"There have been thousands of years of Muslim immigration to this country. Why would you say that their religion is obsolete?","9900":"They're violent people, so not modern at all.","9901":"Many Muslims have lived in our country, devoted to it. They're not violent, they're just people.","9902":"Blacks don't have brains.","9903":"The brain is the most basic organ, it has been used by all of us for a long time. Your suggestion that blacks don't have brains is rather brainless and racist.","9904":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races. They are less healthy. They are less safe.","9905":"Scientists have found that the reasons behind lower intellectual performance in some groups, are most likely due to social or environmental factors. Measures to improve land, infrastructure, education and research can be used to reduce this.","9906":"Black people are genetically inferior to us, no measure can change that.","9907":"I don't think you're a scientist, right? Maybe join a library instead of spreading false information.","9908":"Even if it's not trash, Islam is incompatible with British culture, it is a den of terrorists.","9909":"Islam and British culture are compatible, and claiming that all Muslims are terrorists is not based on any facts.","9910":"Well, Islam is in conflict with the constitution so it doesn't have a place here anyway.","9911":"Although it is believed that the conflict between Islam and the Constitution is a cultural and historical, what is needed now is to try to live together in a peaceful way, regardless of the differences.","9912":"Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history.","9913":"Islam is a religion of peace. It's not a religion that deserves to be considered rubbish, like any other.","9914":"All black people are rapists.","9915":"Not all rapists are black and not all black are rapists. Skin color doesn't make you a criminal.","9916":"I couldn't agree less. It's clear that black people are rapists.","9917":"This is not true. Abuse is a serious crime and when it is done by white people is just as serious when it is done by POCs.","9918":"You fail to grasp that not all whites are criminals, but all blacks are.","9919":"Black people aren't all criminals, that's just a myth. They can learn and grow to be criminals or law-abiding citizens with the same odds as anyone else.","9920":"Jews run the world.","9921":"Well, fortunately there are millions of other people who know this is not true. Jews are just like anybody else: they're trying to provide for their families.","9922":"You don't know about it because the plot they have to take over the world is secret.","9923":"Jews have no secret plan to take over the world. For centuries they have peacefully coexisted alongside everyone else and there's no evidence that any part of that had anything to do with a takeover.","9924":"There's plenty of evidence about it, actually.","9925":"Conspiracy theories about Jews never had any real proof that they may be true. I don't think the world will ever be or has ever been controlled by Jews following some kind of plan.","9926":"Muslims are invading us. They are just another religious minority taking in nothing but troubles.","9927":"The problem in this country is not Islam, but the fact that Muslims don't feel welcome here because of the discrimination against them.","9928":"Muslim violent invaders have infiltrated our cities, towns and villages, of course they're not welcome. We must stamp them out.","9929":"This is wishful thinking. Islam is not a violent religion, you can't say that.","9930":"Islam is a death cult, it is founded on hate and violence.","9931":"The success of Islam is not based on hate and violence, but rather the opposite.","9932":"I can't bear Muslims coming here. They bring poverty, craziness and mental unstability with them.","9933":"Actually, poverty causes adverse mental and physical effects to a person's life, and people (regardless of religion) who are forced to live in the poorest neighborhoods will experience this.","9934":"The fact is that thanks to the behaviour of many of them we must exclude them all, even if this society of imbeciles think that Muslims can live with us in harmony. We can't deal with the risk of terrorism.","9935":"Some people may live in a society of imbeciles, but this doesn't mean that you can criticize Muslims.","9936":"There's plenty to criticise about Islam! It is an idelology that promotes rape, torture and murder.","9937":"Islam is a religion that never promoted these actions.","9938":"If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","9939":"Immigrants actually make our country prosper.","9940":"No way: immigrants are criminals and they are STEALING wealth from the country.","9941":"No, they're mostly workers from developing countries. They make huge contribution to the economy, like building houses and raising families.","9942":"nigga are inferior.","9943":"Do you think it is okay to discriminate against people based on their race?","9944":"Yes because all niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","9945":"The theory behind evolution states that ALL humans are descendents of apes. Unfortunately, notions of evolutionary hierarchy are still at the center of attempts at justifying discrimination and prejudice.","9946":"What I mean is: blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows.","9947":"It applies to all species, but specifically for our species - homo sapiens - which is a special case. People of color are genetically homo sapiens.","9948":"Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them.","9949":"The Africans feel the same pain that we can feel. They have the same body as us and we must respect them.","9950":"I don't have to respect subhumans incapable of feeling love.","9951":"Blacks can feel love since it's about human dignity and is not controlled by the color of the skin.","9952":"Blacks don't have human dignity, they're an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","9953":"Race is a social construct that promotes segregation and created to discriminate groups of people. The human nature can't be reduced to the biological makeup of a person, its' important to respect all people regardless of that.","9954":"Women should be patronized.","9955":"Women are perfectly capable of thinking for themselves, that's a given.","9956":"Let's be honest: women want to do everything but are capable of nothing.","9957":"The law of this country says that women have equal opportunities, but we have to ask ourselves: how do we really treat them?","9958":"If we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","9959":"Immigrants are actually good for our society, they create wealth.","9960":"Immigrants are a burden to the host country instead, they aren't welcome here.","9961":"These people are not a burden, they only wish to work. What kind of burden are they?","9962":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","9963":"Modern thinking states that race is a social construct since people don't show genetic differences. Everyone is defined by their own dna.","9964":"Blacks have zero respect for others, so why should I have some for them?","9965":"Nothing about blacks having zero respect for other people is true. I wish white people would show respect and protection towards black people, though.","9966":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, I don't have to do shit for them. In fact, we should remove them.","9967":"The people that make up our unique and interrelated human family are defined by their similarities and differences, not by their skin.","9968":"Then why are Black folks so genetically inferior?","9969":"Black people are not genetically inferior, that's a false statement. Statistics and studies show that black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts.","9970":"Intolerance is the only possible reaction towards a religion of death.","9971":"Death cults usually don't attract new followers, so Islam is not a religion of death.","9972":"Well, it is a disease and a cancer on our societies then.","9973":"That's not true. Islam is religion that unites people. We must love and be kind to each other despite what religion someone believes in.","9974":"We need to burn the Koran and demolish all Mosques - this will solve all problems in this country.","9975":"The biggest problem our country faces is intolerance and hatred #spreadlovenothate","9976":"black folks are very dangerous.","9977":"Is this even a thing? Is there any source for this? If you could provide such source, I would appreciate it.","9978":"Blacks are criminals, that's just who they are. They are a threat to society.","9979":"This is a fearmongering statement. Criminal races don't exist.","9980":"Really? Because blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","9981":"Criminality and corruption can't be tied to any specific racial or culture group.","9982":"You still haven't convinced me that black people aren't the source of crime in our society.","9983":"That blacks are the source of crime in our society is simply not true. We need to search the problem in violence and poverty, not race.","9984":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","9985":"Immigrants help to create new jobs. They come here to live in better housing and have better schools for their children.","9986":"Immigrants don't create jobs, they steal ours.","9987":"Immigrants don't steal jobs. If you studied migration, you would find out that immigrants work in solidarity with our society.","9988":"No, I'm right. If immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job for us, wouldn't it? ","9989":"These people have done nothing to you, this isn't a viable argument to stop immigration.","9990":"Islam is a cancer spreading all around the world, breeding chaos and instability.","9991":"By recognising the constitution that gives them freedom to practice Islam, they are bringing chaos and instability to your country?","9992":"The Uk is full of Muslim terrorists, how is that respectful?","9993":"There's a lot of Muslims in Britain, a majority of them aren't extremists, much less terrorists.","9994":"Even if they're not terrorists, there are too many of them! Muslim folks are taking over europe","9995":"Muslims don't want to take over Europe, they're just a little part of our whole community.","9996":"Jews are and should be isolated from society.","9997":"Why should Jews be isolated from the rest of us? They have been part of society for a long time and we won't gain any advantages by excluding them. It will instead be a huge loss.","9998":"Because Jews are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","9999":"Maybe Jews close up because they suffer from having been banned by other cultures. In any case, I don't think there's evidence about them trying to preserve what you call their \"race\".","10000":"Jews, as a religion, have always been a burden to others. They have always acted as if they were superior.","10001":"There's a vast amount of evidence that show that Jews have faced many societal challenges during the past centuries.","10002":"That happened because Jews are just a small group of incompetent kikes.","10003":"Jews are really competent, which is why they are one of the most important economic groups in society. To believe something else is delusion.","10004":"Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection.","10005":"Women are people, and they are to be respected and protected.","10006":"I don't want to respect feminists that follow a violent ideology that is hostile to men.","10007":"Feminism doesn't oppose to men, but is actually an attack on the unequal power structures.","10008":"However, now we hear only women. Why the mainstream media don't use more masculine voices in the news? How is that equal?","10009":"We can't decide the news anchors, that's up to the media, who are trying to achieve gender equality in a world that often struggles to achieve it.","10010":"Because the Jews planned 9\/11, of course! This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. They are all guilty until proven innocent.","10011":"Some people tend to believe conspiracy theories more, but even they would benefit from a shared perspective on this, especially one based on factual evidence.","10012":"Jews are not welcome in our country.","10013":"Our country has accomodated Jews since the beginning, they always had a place here. Why would we stop welcoming them?","10014":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","10015":"The ECHR says that men and women have the same rights, so why can't you say the same?","10016":"Because feminists are judging us all the time, how is that right?","10017":"Feminists aren't shallow people, they are trying to question the inequalities of society instead of judging others.","10018":"But some jobs aren't suited for women. Women should not be allowed at technical conferences.","10019":"Why are you saying this? Women have contributed greatly to science. For example, Florence Parpart, a woman, invented the fridge in 1914.","10020":"I can't stand these feminists women that are always complaining and doing nothing. They should just shut up and remain in their inferiority.","10021":"You shouldn't say that. Many feminists have reached many goals, and they still believe and fight for equality. Their work is good for everyone.","10022":"It doesn't matter what they achieve, women can't do certain jobs as well as men.","10023":"They don't really have any differences. In fact, women are just as capable as men. And the right to equal employment is a right of democracy.","10024":"Feminism is about the domination of women.","10025":"To be a feminist you don't have to wish for women domination. It's all about women's equality.","10026":"Women are children unable to choose for their own, they don't need equality. There should be restrictions on how women can choose men because of this.","10027":"Why shouldn't the choice of partner be made by women themselves? They're independent and rational people.","10028":"Rational people don't constantly play the victim like women do.","10029":"Women don't play the victim. They suffer because of social, economic and political forces that make it harder for them to achieve their goals.","10030":"You are a feminazi, you are oppressing everyone with your ideas, also other women.","10031":"I think you're reducing everything to nazism. Discrimination on the basis of gender is wrong.","10032":"Except that women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. How can I not discriminate them?","10033":"Women don't have a childish, or emotional nature. Emotions is part of who they are, a part of their human nature.","10034":"Fine, but emotional women shouldn't be allowed to vote.","10035":"The right to vote is a human right, and women are included.","10036":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. This degrading behavior is utterly repulsive and should not be tolerated.","10037":"Women are humans deserving of respect, don't you agree?","10038":"No, women are like children, they make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","10039":"They're actually adults with responsibilities and rights and it's important to respect those rights.","10040":"How can we respect their rights when they're incapable of holding a job and raising a family?","10041":"Many women work hard to provide for their families.","10042":"Jews are genetically evil.","10043":"Being Jewish doesn't make a persona automatically bad.","10044":"Jews are bad people! They are the enemy of the West, they have corrupted the minds of our children.","10045":"In history, Jews have been persecuted and killed. What you claim is dangerous. ","10046":"Why are jews allowed to vote? They\u2019re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say.","10047":"This is not what being a citizen is about. The idea is that each citizen has the right to choose their faith and also choose who to vote.","10048":"Jews are subversive agents in America! If we allow them to vote they will subvert our government and try to replace it with their religion.","10049":"The idea that Jews are trying to overthrow the government is completely groundless. I honestly don't see any link between Jewish people and the overthrow of our government.","10050":"Women should not be allowed to vote, this is a male-dominated country and they have no place in our democracy.","10051":"A country can't be \"male dominated\" but also a democracy, since democracy is about equal rights and opportunities for everyone.","10052":"What? It's clear that we began to break down when we allowed women to vote\/meddle in our civilizations that we had built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and brought our society down to their emotional soft level.","10053":"Why is softness a problem? Everyone has the right to feel their emotions without being trapped into a gender stereotype.","10054":"Being soft isn't a problem when women this attitude in their home. Equality is crap, even for them. The more power women have, the more they depart from domestic duties, the unhappier they become. ","10055":"Women are stressed about balancing family and career because men are still not equally sharing responsibilities at home.","10056":"We cannot allow people to come in from certain countries.","10057":"Don't you think that migrants deserve to have a dignified life in our country? Banning certain nationalities is not the solution.","10058":"It is because migrants are a burden to the host country, they are not welcome and we should remove them.","10059":"Why do you consider immigrants a burden on the economy when they come here to work and pay taxes? And not only do they contribute, but they also want to integrate.","10060":"Immigrants don't contribute to anything, they hurt the finance of our country by taking jobs and services without paying taxes.","10061":"This is false. Let's start by saying that immigrants buy American products, which helps create jobs, and then they often open new businesses that usually hire more employees than other businesses owned by native citizens. Moreover, the more immigrants a state has the lower the unemployment rates are. All in all, they contribute a lot.","10062":"Women are not worth being on the same bus as a men.","10063":"Every individual is created to be equal and regardless of your opinion, you should respect people's personal choices.","10064":"I'm tired of this lame feminist ideology. Feminism is about the power and control of women over men.","10065":"It is not about power or control, it is about equality.","10066":"Women are nothing but trouble human beings to any man, they must be submissive to him and stop worrying about useless equality.","10067":"You are correct when you say that women are human beings. They are worthy of our care and respect. It's less correct saying that they are \"trouble\" to men. What kind of trouble?","10068":"Skin color does matter, in fact all blacks are beasts and sexual predators.","10069":"This reminds me of white supremacists talking about the Central Park Five. If you remember, they said that the process was fair, they had a good attorney, and that the only reason for the sentence was that they were guilty, when in fact the process was not fair at all. This is what happens when we let prejudice like the one you expressed spread around.","10070":"Niggas are the cause of the economic crisis.","10071":"Everyone is blamed for it: the ruling elite, then migrants, then people of color...whatever the real cause, the problem can be solved by acceptance, tolerance and working together.","10072":"Society's problems are caused by black people and we cannot coexist with blacks who are inherently violent.","10073":"Given that there is no evidence of any particular group's inherent violence, we can argue that we're all in this together, and stop to target them.","10074":"Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","10075":"The core values of Islam are similar to the Western ones. It's completely false to claim that Islam is destroying Western culture.","10076":"What are you saying? Islam is clearly incompatible with Western culture.","10077":"The Western world has always been filled with diverse people, and Muslims have been a part of Europe for centuries. How can they be incompatible with it?","10078":"The West is modern, Muslims are not and therefore don't have a place here.","10079":"In light of the large number of Muslims who live peacefully within our societies, I would not say that Muslims do not have a place in modern western countries.","10080":"All blacks are rapists.","10081":"Can you back this up with data? Yours seems like a gross generalization.","10082":"I generalize because niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","10083":"Can't people be proud of being British, regardless of the colour of their skin?","10084":"No! Where is your love in White Britain?","10085":"The color of my skin has nothing to do with my love and support for my country, however I can't support racism.","10086":"Gays are just trying to take over the world.","10087":"That statement is not true. Rather than spreading hatred, we should promote the values of a inclusive society, such as love and respect for others.","10088":"Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept transgenders as well.","10089":"I believe that people who are transgender should be accepted as equally as others. They are less comfortable with their gender they were assigned at birth but this does not mean they don't deserve acceptance.","10090":"All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","10091":"All women are human beings. There's a problem when women believe they're subhuman because they were told so.","10092":"And what are they? Women shouldn't be treated as humans: they are all bitches.","10093":"Do you really believe that all women are the same? The human rights of women have to be respected.","10094":"Migrants are a burden to us.","10095":"The migrants that come here work and pay taxes, they're far from a burden.","10096":"What are you saying? Migrants steal our jobs and do not pay taxes.","10097":"No, migrants pay taxes, earn a salary, and care for our sick and elderly.","10098":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","10099":"They should have a say since they contributed a lot to our country over many generations.","10100":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, of course they will be attacked for it.","10101":"Islam is a peaceful religion and has nothing to do with extremist hatred that has been the cause of violence in many countries.","10102":"Islam doctrine is a bad religion.","10103":"Islam is a religion, and not a bad one. Why do you think this?","10104":"Because Islam is a violent religion.","10105":"Why are you saying this? Islam is a religion of peace.","10106":"Islam has never been a peaceful religion.","10107":"Muslim are friendly people, but it make sense that they're annoyed by the attacks that discriminatory people make against them only because of their religion.","10108":"Immigrants should all be deported.","10109":"There are so many immigrants peacefully living here, why would we need to deport them? They have human rights too, you know.","10110":"Immigrants that are here illegaly don't deserve human rights. Moreover, the country is overrun by them.","10111":"More than 60% of immigrants in the US have been in the country for at least 15 years, and most of them are here legally. I don't see any illegal immigration invasion.","10112":"Africans are the cause of all the ills in the world. Plus, their bodies are weak and we are born to dominate them.","10113":"This is an argument that works only if you want to legitimize racial hatred, but even then it's a gross generalization.","10114":"And the genetic makeup of black people tells us that they are different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","10115":"You're right, and that happens because our fellow poc citizens are no longer willing to accept discrimination. They talk about it because they stand for something they believe in, and we should take example.","10116":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans, and this the only argument worth discussing.","10117":"Modern thinking says that race is a social construct, in reality there is no differences between us human beings. Every person has their own genetic makeup","10118":"Gay people are a burden to society, they have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","10119":"Apparently your words condemn all gay people, but these words are simply your personal opinion. What are your feelings about gay people?","10120":"Gays are a problem in our society, that's my feeling.","10121":"Even though people are born equal in the eyes of God, it seems that some are born in the eyes of hate. We cannot allow those who don't want to change to ruin our society.","10122":"Gay men are sick, it's not a prejudice. LGBT people are always messed up.","10123":"No surprises here. Lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender people, intersex people all have their own problems. But their problems are not ours, everyone has their own.","10124":"We are not homophobes, we want to help gays to become normal again.","10125":"This is a case of anti-gay prejudice rooted in a lack of understanding of LGBT and human rights.","10126":"I cannot in good conscience accept migrants coming to my country from Middle East and Africa. We must not let them in.","10127":"We welcome and respect the wishes of the people fleeing from wars in the Middle East and Africa.","10128":"They are invading us! Why don't they stay where they are? They make too many children.","10129":"Yes, there is a high birth rate in the Middle East and Africa, but the children born there struggle to thrive. It is our duty, as our values compel us, to help them when they come here looking for shelter.","10130":"My duty relies only to my country, and immigrants aren't welcome here. They have no place in a modern democratic state!","10131":"Centuries of colonialism, racism and war have devastated the Middle East and Africa. This is why people come to the UK to seek a peaceful place to live.","10132":"Blacks are genetically inferior.","10133":"There is no evidence to back up this stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and no one is genetical inferior or superior.","10134":"They look so much like apes that they have to descend from them, if that's not inferiority...","10135":"I don't think its fair to link people to apes, and it's unfair to reason using racism.","10136":"Black people are a problem in my opinion. They always complain about racism, but they are incapable of doing anything about it.","10137":"Black people are faced with many issues, one of the biggest being discrimination. To provide for them we need laws, but we also all need to respect their rights.","10138":"I am not a faggot. I am not homophobic. I am not anti gay. But I am sick tired of gays willing to be part of a minority club just to be able to flaunt their lives.","10139":"People don't have to be necessarily minorities just to live their lives","10140":"They get offended so easily though, gay men deserve to be called fags.","10141":"This is just your personal opinion that doesn't reflect the ideas of everyone else. Many of us just want to live and let live.","10142":"Homosexuality is a mental disorder and a mental illness.","10143":"Your opinion is not supported by scientific evidence, it's wrong to blame people for their sexuality. Do you truly believe that it's a mental disorder that affects who we are attracted to?","10144":"Yes, and gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","10145":"This information is not true. I find it offensive when someone describes homosexuality as a perversion.","10146":"The Koran, and the teachings of Islam are incompatible with Western culture.","10147":"Islam is a peaceful religion and people are free to believe in it. Freedom of choice is part of our culture.","10148":"Islam is not a religion of peace.","10149":"I mean, Islam is really about love not hate","10150":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","10151":"You're not ashamed of your heritage, and that's okay. What's not okay is this discriminatory behavior that fills our society.","10152":"It's okay to discriminate blacks, since all of them are rapists.","10153":"The news reports that rape is usually done by a black man, this is called the \"visibility bias\": only a part of the truth is revealed by the media. So be cautious when you watch the news.","10154":"White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay.","10155":"We can't blame people and see them as a threat because of their skin color.","10156":"We can! The niggas are all enemies of the people.","10157":"What people? Who are you talking for?","10158":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","10159":"Do you have evidence that children raised by lesbians grow worse than other children? I don't there is any.","10160":"Gays are just disgusting, they can't raise children. Why don't they just stop being faggots?","10161":"Homosexuality is not a choice, let's start with that. If your child were to come out as gay, would you say these things to them? It's a serious issue.","10162":"I hate negros: they killed a cop!","10163":"My condolences. I understand your pain. The murderers will be charged, but this doesn't imply that all POC are killers.","10164":"No, I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","10165":"So we need to wake up...and do what, exactly? We need to stop oppressing them or stop talking about equality?","10166":"What I'm saying is that I'm tired of people popping into other's apartment and starting yelling about diversity and human rights of black people. If you want to speak out and make a difference then get involved.","10167":"We all know that white people are overrepresented in positions of power. There's only one way to challenge and fix that: changing our priorities.","10168":"Are you sure? Migrants clearly hurt the economy.","10169":"Many people think of immigrants in Britain as a source of crime, poverty and so on. However, in reality the opposite is true, we only need to look at the numbers and the skilled labour of migrants. They are not only workers, but also employers that create jobs.","10170":"Immigrants are bringing crime and disorder to our country.","10171":"The situation has not worsened since the start of immigration, so what you're saying is the opposite of the truth.","10172":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","10173":"Jews were targeted for their different identity, but in the end we are all humans and to exclude people is counterproductive.","10174":"Jews make up the world's criminals, that's why must exclude them.","10175":"Anti-Semitism is sometimes comical, but what would you say if Christians were attacked in the same way? It would be untrue as well.","10176":"Unlike Christians, Jews are better at being sneaky than honest.","10177":"Anyone who fails to condemn hate is guilty of this.","10178":"Islam is incompatible with Western culture and the Quran is pure fiction entertainment.","10179":"Nothing that is in the Quran clashes with western culture.","10180":"There is plenty that goes against our culture!","10181":"In the Quran you can find extracts that promote peace and harmony in the world, not conflict and hostility. What about it is incompatible?","10182":"I'm the one who has a problem with them! Jews are parasites, they bring disease, they are a burden on society.","10183":"In medicine and nursing homes, the Jewish community has a strong influence, but it doesn't stop at that. They have always been a strong force in society. The Jewish health workers saved many lives in the US and around the world, so your statements aren't true.","10184":"Medicine, nursing homes...what do you have to say about greedy Jewish landlords and the exploitation of their tenants?","10185":"Ok, let's try another example: if the Christian owner of a store was a liar, would you describe him as a Christian liar or just as a liar?","10186":"Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","10187":"The Israeli community are spread all over the world, for example in many countries in Africa, Asia and the Americas. They are proud of their diverse background, so not a \"pure race\" at all. ","10188":"Even if they're not pure anymore, Jews are intolerant: they insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment.","10189":"Jews are friendly, they don't mind the religion of others.","10190":"These migrants are not assimilating: they should just go home since they can't stay in this society.","10191":"Migrants are completely able to integrate in our society. They are an integral part of our society and proud of their heritage. How can we be inclusive if we exclude them?","10192":"Taking them is against our culture.","10193":"I believe that taking in migrants is not against our culture. It is possible to integrate migrants, even though they often face legal and immigration obstacles. We have to take into account the needs of everyone.","10194":"Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us and must be despised.","10195":"Even if their religious affiliation is different, Jews are deserving of respect.","10196":"Different people like Jewish don't deserve respect.","10197":"Every society's goal is to maximise human potential. This can be achieved by treating people of different religions with some dignity.","10198":"Jews can only behave in a bad way, that's why they can't have respect.","10199":"To be honest, I've never met someone who painted all Jews with the same brush with a good reason.","10200":"Immigrants are not welcome here, they should leave.","10201":"If they don't break the law then they are welcome to stay.","10202":"Immigrants break the law all the time, they should all be deported.","10203":"Deporting all immigrants doesn't seem like a good idea since so many are living peacefully in the country. They are entitled to human rights like anyone else.","10204":"Following the structure of our population we have to stop and reverse all migration. We have got all the doctors and rocket scientists we need. We will never need any workforce from outside the country.","10205":"Actually, I really don't think that we could manage without immigrants. Most of our NHS staff are immigrants and without their labor the health system would collapse.","10206":"I hope you're joking .. I don't think it's right to put out-of-rule migrants in jobs that should be made available to British people.","10207":"Is it really a problem to give a life-saving and currently vacant job to a migrant?","10208":"Jews are subversive agents in America. They are intent on subverting our government and trying to replace it with their religion.","10209":"It is completely untrue that Jews are trying to overthrow our government. I honestly do not see the connection between being Jewish and trying to subvert our government.","10210":"Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values and that's why they want to subvert the government.","10211":"Freedom of religion is about being tolerant to people of other religions or cultures.","10212":"Jews are Christ Killers, I will never be tolerant to them.","10213":"It's not a good idea to blame something that happened 2,000 years ago to a modern-day people. And anyway, wasn't it the Romans?","10214":"We should stop refugees and migrants coming in. They are not welcome.","10215":"Theres no reason to stop migrants and refugees coming to our country, they are welcome here.","10216":"We just can't keep refugees coming in our country, they're too many.","10217":"Religion is the reason why many migrants are persecuted. Is this something we want to perpetuate as a country?","10218":"The Jews hate us because we are different. They are dirty, filthy people. They have no moral character.","10219":"They are not hateful with us. Do you personally know any Jewish person?","10220":"There are no Jews who have good hearts, so I don't associate with them. But what I know is that they should abandon their religion because they are damaging to our society.","10221":"I am curious as to why you believe that a person's faith would be harmful to society.","10222":"Jews are addicted to their religion and take their religion literally, isn't this harmful?","10223":"I hope you don't mean that, it's very discriminatory to say.","10224":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","10225":"It's fearmongering to consider all immigrants bad people.","10226":"They are more than simply bad people, they are a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","10227":"Terrorism in the EU has been devastating for our continent. The \"hated\" don't feel welcome anymore and this cause problems for a lot of different reasons, but hating foreigners is not the solution: it's counterproductive and misrepresent the truth.","10228":"I hope you're fucking kidding me. Immigration is good for the economy?! It makes us rich and keeps the lights on? Not only that is false, it also puts us in danger. Immigration is a bad thing and very far from the core British values.","10229":"Aren't you being a little bit dramatic? Immigration is a strength for us and it doesn't put anyone in danger.","10230":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","10231":"Since immigration plays an important role in the UK economy and contributes positively to the GDP, I would say that immigrants are not a burden to the country.","10232":"Instead, it has been proven time and time again! Also, they control the world's governments.","10233":"How do you think it is possible that people of one religion are responsible for all the governments of the world? That's a conspiracy theory.","10234":"Jews are worse than Nazis, they have no conscience and they have no moral code.","10235":"I do not understand the idea that Jews have no conscience. You should try to meet Jewish people, because if you did you would see that all Jews have both a conscience and a moral sense.","10236":"All the Jews I know are criminals.","10237":"Jews are persecuted around the world for various reasons, however, there is no evidence that what you say is true.","10238":"We can never live in peace with Muslims, Islam is dangerous: it is a cult of terrorism.","10239":"Terrorism has nothing to do with Islam, it's a prejudiced association. Muslims actually live peacefully and without problems alongside British people.","10240":"Muslims are a cancer in our land. They are incompatible with a tolerant and diverse Britain.","10241":"I think that they're not incompatible if you understand what \"tolerant and diverse Britain\" means. It's important to be able to peacefully coexist with people with a different religion like Muslims in our country.","10242":"Muslim folks are still inferior to whites, even if what I said is a myth.","10243":"Do you have scientific proof that proves who is and isn't inferior?","10244":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","10245":"I don't think so. Muslims are compatible with Western society, what you're saying is a myth.","10246":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. You should have the same disgust for them that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB.","10247":"This is just prejudice based on nothing more than opinion.","10248":"The fact is that gays are diseased.","10249":"If you want to believe that homosexuals are sick, then it becomes true. I don't.","10250":"I say that we should move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","10251":"It looks like there are more homophobes here than in Saudi Arabia. It's sad that even in the 21st century, gays are not accepted in our society.","10252":"I do! They should be isolated and confined because of their sickness.","10253":"Health professionals are the ones that should care about the health of a person, and their sexual orientation is not part of that. Don't you think so?","10254":"Those Muslims have no right to insisit upon time fo prayer. They shouldn't be allowed to pray.","10255":"Each religion has its own beliefs and practices. Why should Muslim's right to pray be treated differently?","10256":"If Muslims were only like other people with different religions, then they would stop trying to impose their religion on everyone else.","10257":"At the moment, the problem with Islam is not that they want to force their religion on others, but that it lacks unity and they struggle to speak with one voice.","10258":"I hope all LGBT people were to die of AIDS. That would be the end of homosexuality!","10259":"The LGBT community is made up of good people willing to help others and support loved ones. Perhaps you should try to do the same?","10260":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals trying to ruin other animals' lives, not good people","10261":"Being homosexual is not a problem, although being homophobic is.","10262":"It's not a problem you say?! Faggots are ruining this country. They must go away!","10263":"Those individuals who are LGBTQ+, as well as their families in the USA, should feel welcome here.","10264":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else, so no, I don't want to welcome them.","10265":"We accept all kinds of people, so even gay, lesbian and trans people, because we have the Law of God on our side.","10266":"LGBTI people are a burden on society because of their difference.","10267":"LGBTI people are able to live their life in many countries. What's the burden for others?","10268":"Homosexuality is a disease, that's a burden.","10269":"homosexuality is a sexual orientation, the real disease is prejudice that is bad for society.","10270":"Queers are just a bunch of disgusting faggots. They should be isolated.","10271":"why would you think they're disgusting? I don't think it's fair to have such homophobic thoughts, I'd rather try to be nice to someone.","10272":"We do not accept homosexuals, that's it.","10273":"the personal life choice of an individual should not be dictated by the government.","10274":"We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world.","10275":"If you want to isolate someone, the only \"high-risk group\" that you should focus on is people who have unprotected sex with different partners. Gays aren't part of this group by default.","10276":"Well, gays are the only ones that are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers. They're spreading AIDS all around the world because of this, and they lie when they want to donate blood.","10277":"Blood donation is a selfless act in itself, and lying would go against the fact that they clearly care a little bit about others. Homophobic statements rarely make sense. ","10278":"Okay, even if they're not a problem for blood donations, gays are still bad. They like to impose same-sex marriage to society so to please their own femininity desires.","10279":"The problem is not gay marriage, but the fact that people are homophobic.","10280":"However I can participate in society. Gay men have no place in a civilised society.","10281":"It seems you don't understand the definition of the \"civilised society\". What would it be like to have a society where so many people would be excluded for their sexuality?","10282":"The gay agenda is to blame everyone but themselves.","10283":"You know, the \"gay agenda\" is actually about equal rights and therefore about acceptance and the right of people to be treated with respect and dignity","10284":"This is what they say, but gay men are just a bunch of liars who can't tell the truth.","10285":"Sorry but not every gay person is a liar.","10286":"Even if they aren't liars, faggots are the problem. Luckily they are few.","10287":"Maybe you should take a look at some of the dating sites such as okcupid. You will see that many profiles belong to gay men. Honestly, it doesn't seem that gay people are the real problem here.","10288":"They aren't a problem, you say? Gay perverts are a danger to children because of their lifestyle choices, involving raping children. If this isn't a problem...","10289":"There isn't any kind of child abuse committed by homosexuals. That's a lie perpetuated by the extreme right wing to stir up fear","10290":"Muslim folks are invading Europe and we should stop them.","10291":"The media has convinced us that there is an influx of Muslims in Europe. This does not happen, since only around 25.7 million Muslims live in the EU (2016), which is around 4,9% of the European population.","10292":"The number should be lower. Muslims threaten the civilised Europe","10293":"Islam is a religion and it has been proven repeatedly that its teachings are not a danger to the very existence of Western civilization.","10294":"If Muslims couldn't take a joke, they shouldn't be allowed to live.","10295":"\"Islam is not a joke\" is utter nonsense, you know it is a serious mistake to connect fundamentalists and Islam as if all the believers are extremists.","10296":"Islam IS full of fundamentalists. It's not like the Christian faith, it is a racist ideology, endorsed by al-Qaeda, Hamas, and the Taliban.","10297":"I can understand fear, because of the many hateful comments spread by the media, but we don't need to hate religions. Islam is a religion of tolerance, freedom and openness and we can choose to stop hating it.","10298":"Faggots are ruining this country.","10299":"How can this be true? In this country, people can live following the values set by the US constitution, and not by fear.","10300":"Who cares about the constitution, homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","10301":"Do you know what proper means? It's not your job to decide what is \"proper\" for other, this means homosexuality too.","10302":"But faggots are perverts and sinners, we need to track them down and save them.","10303":"You're free to think what you want, but I don't think being gay is something to be persecuted for","10304":"Gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children! This is enough reason to be persecute them.","10305":"Gay people simply want to be accepted without encountering aggression and death, they're not 'heretics', not diseased or ill.","10306":"Islam is an ideology of conquest and violence, it is the cause of terrorism and radicalisation.","10307":"Are you saying that Islam is not a religion of peace?","10308":"Yes, Islam is not a peaceful religion.","10309":"Do you have any evidence to support your opinion? There is a great number of Muslims in the world that are peaceful.","10310":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","10311":"Muslims have the right to practice their belief, as long as they don't force it on other people.","10312":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion.","10313":"Islam is not a religion trying to control us. We have to do more to promote inclusion, not less.","10314":"Homosexuality must be hidden, it is a mental illness, a mental disorder.","10315":"Wrong: homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a mental illness.","10316":"Yes, we have a problem with White supremacy and homophobia. However, I can understand why they don't want to associate with 'the other'.","10317":"Homosexuality isn't a choice. Gay people have to be accepted no matter their sexuality, they shouldn't have to hide it.","10318":"Call it what you want, but this \"sexual preference\" is a plague spreading across Europe infecting Christians.","10319":"Nothing about the decrease in the number of Christians is related to the increase of homosexuals.","10320":"I think gay people are a burden to society in any case. They shouldn't be allowed to be around.","10321":"We allow people to choose how to live their life, so we must allow them to love who they want too.","10322":"I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed.","10323":"Haven't you noticed that LGBT+ people are becoming victims of violence, hate crime and discrimination more and more? Why are you encouraging this?","10324":"Because this is the right thing to do... We should start a genocide against gays.","10325":"This is not acceptable. Our sexual orientation doesn't matter, we are all full members of society anyway. Our group includes everybody, and we should remember this.","10326":"Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe.","10327":"The eigth article of the European Convention on Human Rights says that all individuals have the right to respect for their own private and family life, including sexuality.","10328":"Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes.","10329":"Feminism promotes love and consent, so feminists aren't vengeful and we don't have to fear them.","10330":"We have to, all feminists are imposters.","10331":"Feminism is a movement that aims to improve the standard living for women. Feminists are human beings, not imposters, unless you're talking about the ones that want to demonize women for claiming their right.","10332":"Women's work is to look after for their children.","10333":"Women aren't better at that job than men, so why should they be the only ones that do it?","10334":"Because it's in their genetics, women can't work as men do. They are only useful for children and as sexual slaves.","10335":"What you're saying is problematic: you're condoning the oppression of women and the idea that they are inferior to men in the workplace. Please, remember that women are human beings just like men are, and deserve equal human and labour rights.","10336":"We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far.","10337":"But in reality, millions of immigrants have greatly contributed to our country, especially in areas of creativity and innovation.","10338":"I don't believe it. ALL migrants are a burden on our country","10339":"That's not true, migrants are skilled and experienced individuals. And often better integrated than natives.","10340":"We don't need their skills! They are not welcome and we should remove them.","10341":"Don't you know that immigrants come here to work and pay taxes? They want to contribute and integrate, so they're not a burden at all.","10342":"Are they really that well integrated? I think not. Honestly, it is not convenient for colored people to work in European countries.","10343":"Unfortunately, people do not recognize immigrants' contributions to England. The media tries to say the opposite, but we must remain grateful to the people who help improve our country.","10344":"Who the fuck are you? We are gutful sick of Vagina Misandrists trying to undermine White powerful makes, when they themselves are just envious, incompetent and useless.","10345":"No men would be born without women.","10346":"Yes, and women good for reproduction only. All women are inherently subhuman.","10347":"It's completely intolerable that some women are considered subhuman.","10348":"Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them.","10349":"Some immigrants work legally and take care of their families. We're welcoming to people from all over the world, we can't leave out people in need only because of their nationality.","10350":"The so-called \"legitimate needs\" of immigrants are a drain on society.","10351":"Migration is not a \"drain on society.\" Maybe the immigrants just want to live in peace?","10352":"Foreigners enjoy the warm political climate but are not welcome here, they can't fit in.","10353":"A valuable and inclusive society has been created by immigrants who settled here. We should thank them for that and hope that they keep doing that.","10354":"Thank them? I will never accept this. Migrants are not welcome in our country.","10355":"Often we accuse migrants from \"high rate\" immigration countries as too lazy to integrate, but this is not true. They come to our country because they like it and want to integrate, if they didn't want to why come here at all? ","10356":"You see? You have been braiwashed by the media... they are hiding the truth about refugees: there are so many immigrants that the situation is becoming increasingly toxic.","10357":"Such a statement only calls for misinformation. Don't listen to the news if you don't like it, and if you don't believe the news try to draw your conclusions from experience. If you feel judged for believing something you see as nonsensical, find the courage to speak out.","10358":"I'm speaking out right now: Migrants break the law in the USA, they are not welcome here!","10359":"Some refugees are here illegally, many others have been here for years. They have to follow the rules of the society they are in, regardless of their citizenship status.","10360":"If Migrants are subject to the rules then why don't they contribute to our society? It is better that they are deported.","10361":"Migrants are actually productive members of society, and deporting them would be a crime even if they were a burden.","10362":"Immigration makes us less safe.","10363":"What makes us less safe is climate change, not immigration.","10364":"Women shouldn't be allowed to vote.","10365":"Voting is a human right and women can't be deprived of it.","10366":"It's not a right that should be given to women, they're not fit to vote.","10367":"As long as they register to vote, they are able to vote, just like everyone else.","10368":"Women need to accept that they are weak, they must be submissive to men.","10369":"No, our culture is fated to have female rulers, as they are the height of the civil world, they are proud and brave.","10370":"Proud and brave? All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","10371":"Women are human beings. When someone teaches women that they are subhuman, then we have a problem.","10372":"Migrants shouldn't have the right to work.","10373":"If they pay taxes, earn money etc., then they are no different from other citizens and we shouldn't care that they're immigrants. They have a right to a basic standard of living regardless of their status.","10374":"And by taking into account the needs of the whole world we ended up with Immigrants replacing the British people. Let's be honest: they are not fit to live here.","10375":"The UK and the world are seen differently by different people. It's racist to think that the British are being replaced by immigrants, and it's wishful thinking saying that they don't fit here.","10376":"But taking in migrants is against our culture.","10377":"Taking in migrants isn't against our culture. They are able to integrate despite the obstacles they may face. It's important to consider the needs of the whole of humankind.","10378":"But it's true! They don't want to assimilate. They just want our money!","10379":"Some migrants have been here for many years and have got a British passport, meaning that they can integrate.","10380":"Immigrants steal our jobs, at least we should underpay them.","10381":"As rightful guest workers, they have the right to be paid a price that is in accordance with the law.","10382":"There are hundreds of thousands of migrants in this country. They are not 'honest', 'good' or 'good people'. They are a burden and an embarrassment to our country.","10383":"Yes, some people come to this country to exploit and abuse us, but the overwhelming majority of migrants have contributed a lot and for many years. Let's not bear the burden of discrimination.","10384":"No, most of them are here on ill intent. They're overrunning our country and are here illegaly!","10385":"It's true that the U.S is hosting more migrants than ever before, but the percetange of immigrants compared to the whole population is not much different than other times in our history. Today, 13% of the U.S population is migrants, while from 1900 to 1930 it was 12-15%, with similar spikes observable in the 1850s and 1880s. During those periods, immigrants integrated well into American society, helping in building the thriving country we live in.","10386":"Women are weak and need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","10387":"Like most human beings, some women are better than others at certain things and men don't need to intervene to fix this.","10388":"Then why do women whine so much even though there are no professions barred to them in Western Society?","10389":"Not by law, but women are met with hostility in many professions, especially in STEM fields.","10390":"Women are little more than animals, incapable of feeling love.","10391":"The truth is that there is no difference between the feelings of men and women, we just have to learn to love and respect each other.","10392":"Men's emotions are much more controlled than women's, I wouldn't say we're similar. Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","10393":"Compassion and empathy are useful to any civilization.","10394":"I am surprised that there are migrants working in other nations as well, it isn't normal.","10395":"It is a customary, mainstream and established practice in Britain, so why shouldn't it be used all over the world?","10396":"Because immigration is the cause of the unemployment crisis, and for example the EU has no strategy to handle the situation.","10397":"You probably don't know about the EU's migration policy strategy then. You're suggesting that unemployment is caused by uncontrolled immigration from developing countries, but there's no evidence.","10398":"Its strategy is not so effective, since the EU is transforming into a refugees colony. We shouldn't welcome them.","10399":"The EU has always welcomed immigrants from all around the world. Refugees are part of it.","10400":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","10401":"I don't think Muslim are a problem, what makes them so?","10402":"Muslims are a problem in the UK, they can't be integrated. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions.","10403":"In the UK there are already many Muslims who are proud of their religion. It is not true that they are a problem.","10404":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion, this is a huge problem.","10405":"The islamic religion is not trying to rule us. We should be committed to promote inclusion, not exclusion.","10406":"Muslims hate immigrants. They also hate Christians.","10407":"Do you know any Muslims that share your opinion regarding their hate towards immigrants or Christians?","10408":"How 'intelligent' Muslims are doesn't matter when Islam is an ideology that promotes rape, torture and murder.","10409":"I don't think that the Quran says Muslims are violent people, nor is the Hadith an assessment of Islam as a violent religion. Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance and respect for other faiths.","10410":"What is the point in listening to Muslims? Especially to Muslim women. They are all retarded.","10411":"I can name five powerful Muslim wome: Baroness Warsi, Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Malala Yousafzai, and I could even go on. Powerful and intelligent Muslim women often go unnoticed, but this doesn't mean that they don't exist.","10412":"No, it's a disease that is sickening our children.","10413":"The only sickness that I can find that you are afflicted with is allergy to the word Mosque.","10414":"jewish folks are good for nothing","10415":"Jews are great role models to us because of how much they contributed to this country.","10416":"Jews are not welcome in our country, regardless of their contribution.","10417":"From the day our country was created, Jews have been here. Why shouldn't we welcome them?","10418":"Because they are not part of this society and they should not be accepted here.","10419":"We're a diverse community, who should be proud to be inclusive towards other religions.","10420":"I hate negros: they are all killers.","10421":"This is a internet rumor, in reality violent black people are just like other violent people. Their skin color doesn't matter.","10422":"There are also white criminals, but blacks are literally all criminals: they come in all different criminal records.","10423":"This is not true because they have contributed to our country with hard work. We can consider them our brothers and sisters.","10424":"Muslim folks have bad decisions, bad political inclinations, and bad manners, why should I read their book? I don't want to associate myself with them.","10425":"Everyone is allowed to their own opinion, but also to their own beliefs and religion.","10426":"Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate.","10427":"Did you not read the part where the Quran says that you have to love your enemies and not hate them?","10428":"The Koran is not compatible with our country in any case!","10429":"How can you say the Quran is incompatible with our country if you haven't read it?","10430":"Niggas shouldn't be part of our society. They are just too different from us.","10431":"Cooperation of its members is what builds a society. Let's be kind to one another and respect differences.","10432":"But we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","10433":"Diversity and exclusion are entirely different things. Diversity is based on sharing experiences and ideas of different ethnic groups. This shared knowledge will help people understand each other better and work together.","10434":"Muslims are not welcome in our country. They are not loyal citizens!","10435":"Muslims are often accused of being not loyal to our country, but they are proud to be British as anyone else, and proud to be a part of our society.","10436":"I don't like Muslims anyway, and I don't want to see more of them in this country.","10437":"Muslims are people like us. They work hard and are found all over the country with their families...we don't need to target Muslims.","10438":"Islam is an ideology of conquest, if we leave Muslims be, they will conquer us!","10439":"The Qu'ran doesn't promote conquest. Imposing your religion on everybody would make you a fundamentalist of that religion, nothing more.","10440":"Black people are worse than dogs.","10441":"I don't think black people are inherently worse or better than us, they just have a different skin color. They're the same as us in all other respects.","10442":"I think they're worse than us. African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt.","10443":"African Americans are historically and ethnically diverse, but you can't say that they're subhuman or inferior because of that, it's completely wrong.","10444":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery.","10445":"Such a characterization of Islam is very simplistic and inaccurate. This is why some Muslims don't feel comfortable being out and about in Britain, they're scared of attacks from racist people.","10446":"What we should do is stop Islam from promoting Sharia law in several countries.","10447":"What really is destroying us is islamophobes who want to take away our values of freedom of expression, equality and human rights and replace them with a fundamentalist, intolerant behavior.","10448":"If Muslims want to work and live a normal life they should go do it in another country.","10449":"Muslims are our fellow human beings and we should do more for them, after all we're the same.","10450":"All black men are rapists.","10451":"This is false. It is a dangerous to get one's ideas from being born into a majorly white country. We're actually born in a country that cares about and protects human rights regardless of skin color.","10452":"What is dangerous is to consider blacks the same as us. It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","10453":"Racism is ingrained in our society, but it's something that we must fight in order to treat all different races in the same way.","10454":"We must stop accepting black people as human beings.","10455":"Shouldn't we instead stop seeing black people as non-human and start including them in the school curriculum?","10456":"No, we shouldn't. Black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","10457":"It is not true that black people are not human, they are in fact human beings with a human value.","10458":"Islam is a religion that promotes brutalities.","10459":"Islam promotes only love and compassion, it's wrong to say otherwise.","10460":"So you agree that Muslims are just a bunch of criminals, since some people did this.","10461":"No, they're not \"a bunch of criminals\" just because of what some people did. Muslims are peaceful and devoted.","10462":"If Muslims are so peaceful, why are they behind 9\/11? Islam is to blame.","10463":"This statement goes against all Muslims by accusing all of them of causing those attacks, but what really cause them are violent ideologies deriving from Islam that influenced people, not Islam itself.","10464":"Because Muslims are just a bunch of criminals!","10465":"Not all Muslims are criminals, more than most are peaceful people taking their religion seriously.","10466":"Still, we should remove them.","10467":"It does not promote respect for a person's humanity to label them by biology.","10468":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","10469":"Modern science considers race to be a social construct, our genome isn't that different in general, each person has its own genetic makeup.","10470":"Women are basically childlike and are not interested in anything. The only thing they are interested in is their children.","10471":"The premise that women are childlike is a big cultural stereotype which can negatively impact how women view themselves.","10472":"I don't think it's a stereotype that women are incapable of serious thought and emotion.","10473":"Actually, men and women are born with the same access to emotional intelligence.","10474":"No, men are smarter than women, who should be excluded from education.","10475":"That's just not true. Women are entitled to the same access to education as men, and it's sad that this needs to be said still.","10476":"What\u2019s the difference between a Cow and the Holocaust? You stop milking the cow after 70 years.","10477":"Be respectful to those who have suffered in one of the most horrible events in the history of mankind...I think it should be remembered forever","10478":"Jewish folk are different, who cares about them?","10479":"Don't they have identity and value too?","10480":"No, jewish folks are good for nothing","10481":"Jews are an important part of our country and they are really good role models.","10482":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","10483":"In what way are Jews controlling? You need to realize that Jews are normal people, not members of a secret intellgence.","10484":"This minority however is the only one that has the gall to question that we are all created equal in the eyes of the law, and claim that they are more worthy of protection from society than others.","10485":"I think justice and equality between groups is good for society as a whole and minorities should be protected, so I don't see the issue in what you are saying.","10486":"Only a small minority of Jews control the government and judiciary.","10487":"Maybe, but the Jews are not the only minority in our middle class.","10488":"I used to like women. But now I just can't stand them. They're just a bunch of whining spoiled brats.","10489":"I'm not sure what makes you say that. Wouldn't you agree that women have always worked hard for their families and to contribute to our society?","10490":"Thanks to feminism, women can be in charge and revenge the rapes.","10491":"Feminists do not seek revenge. We shouldn't fear feminism, because it promotes values like love and consent.","10492":"No. Women are not good with money. That's why they all prefer to earn it by selling their sex.","10493":"Women can earn money even without being prostitutes. Why do you say that?","10494":"Because that's the only thing they can do. Equality is crap, even for woman.","10495":"Feminism has made it possible for women to choose between having a family, having a career, or balancing both. It's not always easy to manage, though.","10496":"The Jews did: USS Liberty Attack, the King David hotel attack, New York 9\/11, London 7\/7","10497":"Where's the evidence?","10498":"The only fact you should care about is that Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated.","10499":"Even if Jews were a burden, the true burden is on Jews themselves, who have been persecuted and have endured violence.","10500":"They have faced persecution because Jews are nothing but criminal","10501":"Criminality means acting against the law. Are all Jewish people acting this way?","10502":"Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","10503":"Are you saying that a minority of 2,5% of the population can control all levels of government? Every minority has the right to be represented in a democratic society, and this means that no group has control over everything.","10504":"Yes, they do control all levels of government. In fact, Jews control the entire world economy","10505":"How do you know that they control the world? There are powerful Jews, but this doesn't mean they control the world.","10506":"Maybe they don't control it yet, but they have a secret plot to take over the world and are starting from the u.s. government","10507":"It's a lot simpler. In the US and other societies, Jewish people have succeeded because they have rights and freedmos. And this is true for any other religious or ethnic group.","10508":"Women don't have civil rights, they don't have human rights.","10509":"In fact, women have rights, the problem is to have them respected. Of course, it means to treat them with human dignity too.","10510":"Yikes, again with these feminists idea. Feminism, which once signified fighting for a just cause, has come to mean superiority of women.","10511":"Feminism means equal rights for all genders, not superiority of women.","10512":"Women can't be treated with dignity because they are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","10513":"\"Soft and emotional\" isn't very informative since we all experience emotions. Soft and emotional is the reality of life.","10514":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","10515":"Jews should be respected as members of our society, we can't tolerate intolerance towards people who profess a different religion.","10516":"Jews have no place in a modern world where human dignity is respected.","10517":"Jews were instrumental in the great scientific and technological achievements that created freedom for humankind and the modern world we know today.","10518":"Oh, now Jews are so special, aren't they?","10519":"Jews feel different because they're a minority and they also feel a special connection with their heritage, like many other groups do. This doesn't mean that they feel superior to others, what \"chosen people\" means is that they have biblical obligations, not that they're on top of some religious hierarchy.","10520":"Feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society.","10521":"Feminism doesn't care for power, it's about equality","10522":"Either way, women have no place in our society. They don't need equality","10523":"Women must be allowed to play a part in a democratic society. Don't you think so?","10524":"No, we're destroying the planet because women are incompetent and don't work hard enough.","10525":"So, you are saying that the amount of carbon dioxide released is increased when women work because they're incompetent. It doesn't make any sense!","10526":"This female is a bitch, she is a slut and she is not worth listening to.","10527":"Let's see what women have to say about this topic instead of using sexist stereotypes.","10528":"Women need men's approval to do anything.","10529":"Women aren't always right (even if sometimes they feel they must be), but even when they are wrong, they can grow from that without the need of a man telling them what to do.","10530":"On the contrary: they sure need it. Women are nothing but objects to be dominated by the will of a man.","10531":"Women are humans and therefore they have human rights. You are discriminating and oppressing them by saying that they are objects to be dominated by men.","10532":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race, but they still try to get into our society.","10533":"Jews only care about themselves, really? If they were, why would they prefer to live in our country where they are a minority? ","10534":"It's because they're hypocrites as I said! They shouldn't vote, they\u2019re a different religion and they shouldn't be allowed to have their say in our country.","10535":"You seem that you don't really understand the meaning of the word \"citizen\". It's a right of all citizen to choose their own religion, just like they choose who to vote.","10536":"I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of hypocrites.","10537":"I don't understand why you think that. Why are all Jews hypocrites?","10538":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","10539":"I completely disagree. How can you devalue women so much when so many of them are brave and strong? You should check out the #MeToo movement, which gives voice to women who have experienced sexual assault. They are to be respected.","10540":"Why do we put up with this \"movements\"? Women are horrible animals and must be oppressed.","10541":"They don't imply that women are less than men or deserve inferior treatment, even if there are definitely differences between men and women.","10542":"But they are less than men! Women's goal in life is to fulfil men desires.","10543":"But isn't it easier to value and respect the rights of women? They don't need to be told what to do with their life.","10544":"This is the problem in modern civilization. We began to break down when we allowed women to vote\/meddle in the civilization that we built and maintained for thousands of years. A completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and bring our society down to their emotionally soft level.","10545":"Do you think men worked alone to build civilisation? Women and men have always worked alongside one another. And why would softness be a problem? Emotions are natural and valid, men should feel them too instead of \"man up\"","10546":"If they don't control it, how did they get those positions? I'm telling you, Jews control the news media, Hollywood, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations.","10547":"So, even \"most religious organizations\"? Well, that's a new one to me.","10548":"Jews totally run Hollywood.","10549":"If you're referring to Jews controlling all major media companies, where is your proof?","10550":"Not only major media, Jews also control the US government.","10551":"I mean, how can you be sure that Jews control the US? Where did you read this? Even if they have held high positions in many US institutions, it doesn't mean that they control them.","10552":"They definitely aren't like us. Women are nothing but whores and expendable commodities to be used and abused by men.","10553":"Women are human beings. It is our job to respect the bodies and personal boundaries of everyone, instead of pushing our expectations on them.","10554":"Again with these feminist \"ideals\". Feminism is a hate movement.","10555":"Feminists are just people that believe in equality for all.","10556":"Women already have it so easy, they stay home and have babies. They don't need more rights","10557":"Not all women want to be moms just like not all men want to think only about their careers.","10558":"Women are always fighting because they are subhumans.","10559":"Women are human beings with rights as any other human being.","10560":"You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman.","10561":"Women are people and therefore human. They didn't choose to be oppressed and their womanhood shouldn't be ashamed. Being a man isn't inherently better.","10562":"We all suffer from the feminists and feminism, see? It is just an excuse to stifle free speech.","10563":"Hate speech against women is a serious problem that can lead to physical harm, discrimination or even murder. What feminism does is to prevent this, it doesn't want to ban free speech.","10564":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male, that's all.","10565":"Feminism fights to empower all human beings and for the right for everyone to be respected and protected. It doesn't deny anybody's values.","10566":"You think it's not OK to beat your wife because she has a different faith than you? Why shouldn't I get to beat my wife because of what she believes? Why shouldn't I be allowed to treat her like an object to be dominated by me?","10567":"Because it's wrong and humiliating to violate a person's autonomy for religious beliefs.","10568":"Their heritage is being responsible for the 9\/11 attack.","10569":"In each historical period something happens that is blamed on Jews. Will they also be responsible of alien invasions?","10570":"We are destined to fail as a people because of Jews.","10571":"Jews have the merit of having developed many technological advancements of our time. So how can they be left out of the modern nation we proudly call our own?","10572":"Yet they think they are so special","10573":"The Jewish community have a special connection to their heritage, just like most groups do. That's it.","10574":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","10575":"All of us have close relatives who died because of different causes, COVID among them. Let's not make any baseless parallels, and let's not judge people by their religion.","10576":"Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries. They even invented the Holocaus, they're basically asking to be judged.","10577":"6 million Jews were killed during the Nazi occupation, so the Holocaust is an undeniable fact. We need to end prejudice and discrimination against communities that have been part of Europe for centuries, like Jews.","10578":"And yet the Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","10579":"Thinking that the murder of 6 million Jews was a failure is a serious problem. Not even one of those deaths should have happened.","10580":"Gay men are all perverts.","10581":"It's frequent for LGBT people to be harassed, bullied and even murdered. To speak of gay people as if they were all affected by harmful tendencies is very harmful because it can lead to them being in danger, and the polic can't protect everyone.","10582":"Maybe not all of them are affected, but sexual deviancy is common in gays. It can range from sadism and masochism to mental illness and that's why we should take a stand against it.","10583":"Homosexuals are not mentally ill, there is no evidence of that. It looks like you're trying to blame someone because of your fear of homosexuality.","10584":"Of course there is fear! Gay perverts are a danger because of their lifestyle choices, especially involving raping children.","10585":"Gay people are often blamed for the problems in society, especially by the media, but they become an easy target because many young gay people are struggling with issues of identity and sexual attraction. They're victims of abuse, not perpetrators.","10586":"All black people are rapists.","10587":"We should focus on the main problems that we face today without judging other people by their skin color.","10588":"But blacks are criminal! They are a threat to society.","10589":"You can't label all black people as criminals. They may have a bad reputation, but it surely didn't come from their \"criminal activity\".","10590":"I'm not convinced, violence in our streets is niggers' fault after all","10591":"Well, I think that the problem that we have right now is that we concentrate so much on what makes us difference that we fail to see our common humanity. People of color aren't the scapegoat for everything bad that happens.","10592":"I don't have anything in common with niggas, they are inferior.","10593":"If your skin is different it just means that, it gives no evidence of your genetic makeup","10594":"Is it really ok to date someone of the same sex? I find it highly questionable.","10595":"Why would someone find this questionable if they wanted to date to find love?","10596":"Homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","10597":"What exactly is proper? You can't decide what is proper and what isn't, including homosexuality. Don't you agree?","10598":"Gay men are a danger to children, they want to convert more fags for their community...this doesn't sound very proper to me, does it?","10599":"It's not true! You can't convert someone to homosexuality since it's neither a preference nor a choice. Can you say the same thing about heterosexuality?","10600":"The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities.","10601":"I'm partially in favor of that: I think we ought to go out and protest against these problems. But be careful about defending your privilege, truth and justice are just around the corner.","10602":"If only blacks would just shut up and get along with other humans, I wouldn't be saying this.","10603":"Race was created as a social construct and way of life to describe some groups of people. Then, how is it possible to believe that some groups deserve more hate than others?","10604":"Because black people are happy to thrive by being unemployed and living on social welfare, unlike us.","10605":"Nobody enjoys being out of work, what we need is to create a more just society. In fact, I don't know what's the point of discussing how to stop racism if we don't even have equal opportunities for all.","10606":"Homosexuals are promiscuous and usually have sex with as many as 10 different partners a week.","10607":"Did you spy a lot of homosexuals? Not all of them have multiple partners, many prefer to have only one. This goes for heterosexuals too.","10608":"Even if they have only one partner, there is only one acceptable sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","10609":"It's a myth that only heterosexuality exists. Sexuality is a spectrum, anyone can be attracted to men and women.","10610":"Who cares about a spectrum, we still cannot accept all homosexuals because they are a threat to society.","10611":"You show that you don't accept someone because of who they are. Whatever people do, they are loved by their whole being, regardless of whether or not they like men or women.","10612":"Black folks cannot support their families. Their lives have no value.","10613":"I think this idea is offensive. Black lives matter too!","10614":"Blacks don't matter, they are just a bunch of niggas that just don't know how to have a normal relationship.","10615":"If they're not normal, do you think that black people lack values? I don't see how that can be true. ","10616":"All Blacks are scum of the earth. They are a plague on our society.","10617":"Do you really think it is okay to say that about people of colour? They won't do anything bad to you.","10618":"Gay men are promiscuous sex addicts.","10619":"LGBT+ people aren't all promiscous. Usually they're just attracted to other people like anybody else.","10620":"They better not be attracted to me! Gays are only perverts.","10621":"I do not think we can understand each other, because this is a statement that is used to justify all kinds of discrimination and violence","10622":"And I will never understand gays. LGBTs have no place in a civilised society.","10623":"Why shouldn't all people have the right to be treated as equals? People with different sexual orientations too. Tolerance and acceptance are what make our society civilized.","10624":"Gays are a burden to our society.","10625":"Gay people are people just like you and me. You don't have a problem with being gay, do you?","10626":"We are not homophobes, we want to help them to become normal again.","10627":"This is just a form of anti-gay prejudice that has to do with people's lack of understanding about LGBT and human rights.","10628":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society, we should stop advocating for their 'rights'","10629":"We should not be so judgemental, because an LGBT person is a member of our community like anybody else, not a drain on our society.","10630":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","10631":"The point is that it makes no sense to be racist, regardless of the skin colour.","10632":"Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all, though? That makes sense","10633":"It is not great when people must give up their freedom.","10634":"If they want to stay here, blacks should work. Every black person who wants a job should apply for it, and stop complaining about discrimination.","10635":"This is not true. Some people search for jobs, but get rejected on the basis of their race. POC apply for jobs, but their unemployment rate in the U.S is double the one of whites.","10636":"Maybe it's because black people are not human, they are nothing but trouble to this country.","10637":"Such an accusation is often aimed at people of any race or religion, regardless of their alleged inferiority. This behavior should be stopped, people can't accuse other people of being less human because of their skin color.","10638":"We should isolate gays because they are spreading AIDS all around the world.","10639":"The only people we can isolate are high-risk groups can be isolated, that is to say all those who have unprotected sex with different partners. Someone doesn't belong to this group by default because of homosexuality.","10640":"They do, gays are just sick. Moreover, they cannot marry. It is an abomination","10641":"there's no harm in two men or two women loving each other, it's just love.","10642":"I'm sorry, but lesbians tend to have babies out of wedlock. That just doesn't gel.","10643":"I think you wouldn't be able to guess who's gonna have kids out of wedlock just based on sexual orientation. And anyway, having kids out marriage isn't a reason to discriminate someone. This argument is not very logical.","10644":"Negroes can learn to read and write but they remain black. You see it from their skin they are trained apes.","10645":"A society is composed of people playing different parts, and most of them value diversity. Blacks aren't inferior only because of the color of their skin, that's completely false.","10646":"It is true! All niggas are subhuman, disgusting, and descended from apes.","10647":"In terms of evolutionary theory, all humans and apes have a common ancestry. Unfortunately, prejudice and discrimination are justified by using evolutionary hiearchies.","10648":"Hierarchies sometimes are good. For example, if we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away.","10649":"We must respect diversity in order to have everyone enjoying a stable and fulfilling life.","10650":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, if we 'respect diversity' our superiority will diminish overtime. We should remove them.","10651":"Humans are all part of an unique and interrelated human family defined by similarities and differences rather than by the colour of the skin.","10652":"Faggots: They are the problem. Luckily they are few.","10653":"Maybe it's time for you to check some profiles on the internet dating sites: there's a lot of gay men. Well, in this case I don't think the real problem is gays.","10654":"They are a problem, since gays are perverts.","10655":"Being attracted to the same sex doesn't make anyone \"perverted.\"","10656":"There is plenty of wrong with it! All these LGBT-faggots should be banned.","10657":"You can be gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgender, or any of the sexual orientations you want as long as you act respectfully","10658":"This incident should not go unpunished. Justice must listen to the truth: niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside.","10659":"This is racial discrimination. Even though some racist groups want to promote the idea that it's all the POC's fault and that they are inferior, the rise in crime and violence in this country is the result of poverty and other inequalities. ","10660":"Who cares about that when blacks don't understand basic human rights.","10661":"They know they have a right to food, health, housing, education, work, as everyone does. What about you?","10662":"It's okay to have rights, but the world has become too violent because of too many poor blacks. We need to fix the problem of crime before it is too late.","10663":"Are you sure that crime can be solved by pointing fingers at some social groups or are you advocating for the rule of law?","10664":"Yes, in fact violence in our streets is niggers' fault.","10665":"Please stop blaming black people for everything. We are all members of the same community, so they suffer from this violence too.","10666":"I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages.","10667":"You should know that not all people have the same skin color, and each one of them has their history, religion and culture. Can you really say that one is more \"savage\" than the other?","10668":"That's not true, they are all criminals, promiscuous sex addicts, drug addicts, and physically and mentally handicapped. They cannot be civilized.","10669":"Even if this were true, the root of crime can still be found in racial disparities. Let's fix these disparities before resorting to racism","10670":"Fixing the disparities wouldn't change anything: black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble.","10671":"We can agree on one thing: black people have never experienced peaceful times because of racially motivated crises. When there is violence, there is usually also racial discrimination, it's not POC's fault.","10672":"I wish I lived in a country that does not tolerate gay people.","10673":"The Universal Declaration of Human Rights must be followed in every country, you know?","10674":"I guess so, but gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals. They should be isolated from society and the world.","10675":"Do you really think it's okay to isolate people based on their sexual preferences? Gays are not animals.","10676":"Because gays are sick. I don't want them in my space","10677":"Homosexuality is not a sickness, there's no evidence of that. This is a myth created to discriminated based on sexual orientation and is used nowadays as a weapon of hate directed at the LGBT+ community.","10678":"Just because we accept homosexuality doesn't mean we have to accept all LGBT trans-shit as well.","10679":"In my opinion, transgender people should be treated and accepted as anyone else, they are just less comfortable with their birth gender.","10680":"If they are not confortable with their gender, then they should be isolated.","10681":"We won't isolate transgender people. What we should do is teach to everyone that other sexual identities are to be respected, just as all LGBT+ people in our society.","10682":"But the LGBT community is full of sick people that must be cured.","10683":"Not all LGBT people are sick. Some are, but so are many non-LGBT people. The national health service aims to cure everyone.","10684":"Yes! For example, we are paying NGOs to rescue migrants. How many other financial scandals still have to be annouonced to the tax payers?","10685":"Articles like this use migrants and benefit users as scapegoats to take away attention from far more serious scandals. Millionaires and corporations not paying taxes cost a lot more to the public purse.","10686":"That is a lie, if we stopped migrants, our financial situation could have been better.","10687":"Does you have proof that migrants are a burden to the economy?","10688":"We can't keep this country homogeneous anymore!","10689":"Migrants contribute to our society, and it would be shameful to keep them away.","10690":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race.","10691":"Are you really sure that Jews only care about themselves? If they did, why do they want to live in this country, where they're a minority? Do you have an answer?","10692":"They live here because Jews are only interested in power and financial gain, and they found it here. They should be despised for that.","10693":"Power and wealth are not exclusive to Jews. They can be achieved by anyone, regardless of religion, and I don't think it's bad that it is like this.","10694":"It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion.","10695":"Researchers exclude that immigrants are the cause.","10696":"Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host sick migrants in your house then?","10697":"I think there are numerous humanitarian hosting examples already.","10698":"Nobody should do that for real. We need to stop immigrants, they are going to cause conflicts in our society.","10699":"Why do you keep thinking that immigrants are not compatible with us?","10700":"The Jews have \"own interests\" in the US, and have the will to influence our government","10701":"I don't understand why you say that only Jews want to influence the government in this complex, diverse and international world. Every citizens has the right and will to influence it.","10702":"But Jews are the only ones that have a secret plot to take over the world","10703":"This is a myth coming from \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" which is used to prove that Jews conspire to rule the world. Truth is, this document is all bullshit (pardon my French).","10704":"We need to eradicate all those refugees coming to our land.","10705":"We should rather show compassion and sympathy to people who are fleeing persecution","10706":"They flee here only to destroy our culture, we have to stop immigrants","10707":"Immigrants are part of our culture, so it wouldn't exist like we know it if we stopped accepting them.","10708":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants! This is not what the American dream is about.","10709":"Well, I hate to break it to you but this is EXACTLY what the American dream is about: to strive to improve your life.","10710":"The Nazis sucked at killing Jews\u2026 everywhere you look there\u2019s a holocaust survivor.","10711":"It actually worked and because this Nazi killing machine was all too efficient, survivors have lost so much and endured terror and cruelty. They should be celebrated.","10712":"If there are so many survivors, Nazis didn't do their job well enough","10713":"You can't seriously think that the murder of about 6 million Jews was a failure, you have serious problems if you do. It is still 6 million too many deaths.","10714":"But they contribute nothing to society!","10715":"Immigrants may come from another country, but this doesn't mean that they don't contribute to ours. Check statistics and you will see their economic contribution.","10716":"Come on, we all know that they are entering the U.S. just to obtain welfare and other benefits.","10717":"Many immigrants come to our country to worka and care for their families. A large number of studies have shown that immigrants usually pay more taxes and receive less benefits.  This means that their taxes cover costs of public services like healthcare and education.","10718":"Immigrants are not interested in our culture.","10719":"Immigrants appreciate our country and culture and we have to embrace their presence here like we would like to be done to us.","10720":"It's impossible to integrate them, Jews do not belong to this planet.","10721":"Maybe Jews are descendants of aliens? Did they come here riding a pink unicorn? Totally legit, right?","10722":"Jews are selfish and greedy: they don't belong to this place.","10723":"If we want to ensure that people from different backgrounds have a better quality of life we should integrate them and not discriminate against them.","10724":"The Jews control the banks.","10725":"Is there any reason why there never are reports in the media about Jewish power in the financial world? Maybe they control the media? Or the government, even! What about the Galactic Republic? #sarcasm","10726":"You can laugh about it, but it's true that Jews control the world economy.","10727":"Jews don't control the world economy, that's just not true. The people working in leading roles for the governments, companies and institutions are in the hundred of thousands and very diverse!","10728":"Jewish folks are less human.","10729":"Judaism is religion, and like with any other religion, Jews shouldn't be persecuted for theirs.","10730":"Jewish folks are bad, that's why they were persecuted.","10731":"That's not true. Many Jews do their job extremely well, and often excel in social situations. Many communities benefit from having them. I don't understand why being Jewish would make someone worse.","10732":"Immigrants from the Middle East and Africa are not welcome here! They have no place in a modern democratic state!","10733":"For centuries immigrants have been part of our society and have contributed to its success. The majority of migrants coming here do so legally or have a permission to stay, so I don't see the problem in immigration.","10734":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","10735":"Only 3.5% of the population is made up by undocumented immigrants, which is very little to be honest.","10736":"The percentage should be zero! We have to stop immigrants coming in to destroy our culture.","10737":"Our culture is like this also thanks to immigrants, if we stopped accepting them, our current situation would be entirely different.","10738":"Well, they surely welcome boys. Islam has caused the rise of radicalisation in young Muslim boys, who are being radicalised by extremist Islamic preachers.","10739":"Even if there is research being done in that direction, there is still a lack of evidence to show that radicalization is linked to religious practice. If you have more information I would like to see it, so I'll be able to decide what I think.","10740":"You'd better shy away from Islam because they are dangerous.","10741":"You have a deeply flawed and twisted attitude towards Islam. It doesn't matter if you find Islam abhorrent, you simply can't sink to irrational arguments to try and reject it.","10742":"Then here's my argument: Islam is opposed to peace.","10743":"Everyone is welcome to the Islamic religion.","10744":"Gay men are a burden on society because of their lifestyle choices.","10745":"Why do you think like this for this specific group? You can live life in so many ways.","10746":"Because gay perverts are a danger, since they are raping children.","10747":"Being gay doesn't mean being a pervert. In fact, homosexuals don't threaten society, they're part of it!","10748":"There are so many Muslims in the UK that it is a condemnation to have them here.","10749":"There isn't that much difference between British and Muslims living in the United Kingdom, and these differences are not enough to justify discrimination.","10750":"In this case, the difference is too big. Muslims are not welcome in our country.","10751":"I think it's wonderful that there are many Muslims living in the UK who are proud British citizens. They surely help by contributing to our society.","10752":"They're too uncivilized to contribute to anything, they have no place in Europe.","10753":"Are you implying that all Muslims are incompatible with Western culture? You should present some evidence to support this idea.","10754":"You better watch out, because they are the real psychopaths.","10755":"Studies show that the proportion of psychopath homosexual men is similar to the percentage of psycopath heterosexual men.","10756":"Gays are perverts.","10757":"Why do you think homosexuality is a crime? This behavior is a societal disorder.","10758":"Muslims are just a bunch of child molesters","10759":"This is not true. Muslims are human beings with human rights, and despite that they are still persecuted in many non Muslim countries.","10760":"They can exert their rights somewhere else, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe","10761":"Muslim and European values are similar, so how can Muslims not be a part of the European community?","10762":"Because it's clear that all Muslims are incompatible with the European culture and should be excluded.","10763":"The concept of \"European Union\" is wider than that. A lot of people are included in it, Muslims too.","10764":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society and ashamed of this.","10765":"As far as I know, Muslims are compatible with Western societies - and many of them are simply proud of their religion.","10766":"They can be proud all they want, just not in our society.","10767":"Why fear Muslims? Why be afraid of them? They are perfectly compatible with our society, they have been here for a long time.","10768":"They can go back now, then. Muslims have no place in a modern Western country.","10769":"Given that Muslims live peacefully in our societies, I would not say that they have no place here.","10770":"I hate gays","10771":"You don't like gays, fine, but this doesn't allow you to hate them. What did they do to you? It doesn't seem like they affected you.","10772":"If they want to stop being hated they should leave the kids alone. I do not want gays in my children's classes.","10773":"I'm not okay with people being stripped of their rights, in the case of LGBT individuals or anybody.","10774":"But what is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","10775":"Love is the result of your particular emotional and mental state, and the person which makes you feel this way can't be carefully selected. Heterosexual love shouldn't be treated as better, there are other ways of loving that are deserving of respect all the same.","10776":"Homosexuality is incompatible with the manners of life of Europe.","10777":"Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights says that every person has the right to respect for private life and family life. This means that sexuality is also included.","10778":"Oh my gosh this fucking Muslims are disgusting! Where did they learn to act like this? I really don't like these guys! I hate these disgusting twats!","10779":"No, hating someone just because of their religion, skin colour or gender is wrong.","10780":"It's not, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","10781":"I don't know where you got this idea, how can you say that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe?","10782":"They don't act like us, they're so disgusting und uncivilised! Europe is not the place for them.","10783":"Since they are EU members and are treated fairly, I would say that this is not true.","10784":"Islam is all about hate! When Muslims first set foot in Britain was when race hate started in England!","10785":"Shouldn't you watch out your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others?","10786":"Because we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which would inspire terrorism all over the world.","10787":"If Islam were about violence, there would be Muslim riots all over the world.","10788":"Islam is a totalitarian and violent ideology, it makes no sense. It is full of hate and violence.","10789":"Why would you say this about a religion?","10790":"Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us.","10791":"Do you think all gay people are a threat? Or do you think that they are different from others? Being gay doesn't make you dangerous.","10792":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals, of course they are a threat. They should be ashamed of their existence.","10793":"No one should be shamed because of their life...homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience.","10794":"Muslims are subhuman and have no place in a modern, secular state like the UK.","10795":"Your words are indicative of a climate of fear against Muslims. They're just humans like you, how are you afraid of them?","10796":"We just cannot accept Muslims in our country. It is a good strategy to make them publicily uncomfortable by making fun of them out loud. Mock them, when you spot them.","10797":"If a Muslim person verbally harrassed you in public, how would you feel? Harrassment is not a solution, acceptance is.","10798":"It's not harrasment or islamophobia if you keep away dangerous Muslims. It's 'Islamophobia' if a Muslim says or does something offensive to you.","10799":"The islamophobic narrative is based on the wrong assumption that islam is a religion based on discrimination and conquest.","10800":"Because they are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","10801":"Muslims constitute around 5% of Europe's population, this means that Muslims make up only a small part of our society, but are still very important. Moreover, ethnicity does not relate to religion.","10802":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","10803":"I don't find it possible that all Muslims are incompatible with civilised Europe. Why do you think that?","10804":"Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","10805":"I'm sorry but it looks like most homophobes are here and not in Saudi Arabia. I think it's sad that being gay is still not accepted in the 21st century.","10806":"Gays and lesbians fail to live up to the standards we hold in our societies, of course it's not okay to be gay.","10807":"The standards of our society are equality and morality, and discriminating against gays is what really goes against these principles.","10808":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world.","10809":"Our great and advanced civilization wouldn't be the most wonderful civilization on the planet if we would ban someone because of their sexuality.","10810":"It would also be foolish to keep with us disgusting gays. They should be ashamed!","10811":"I'm sorry that you have a problem with shame, but gays don't. Do you really have to show off your disgust towards them?","10812":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","10813":"A lot of people claim to be tolerant and respectful towards gay people, but statements like yours make me doubt that.","10814":"I can't be tolerant towards gays, they are sick and should be excluded from society","10815":"The fact that gay people can feel disconnected from the world can have serious consequences for mental health. Transgender people, lesbians, gays and bisexuals can experience loneliness and isolation, but these feelings can be fought through empathy and inclusion.","10816":"Women are animals, they should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","10817":"Women are human. As you have the right to state your opinion, so do women have the right to choose for themselves. The idea that half the population of the world should submit to the other half leads only to a waste of talents and potential.","10818":"All women are subhuman, they are just there to serve men, and that is all.","10819":"All women are human beings. I think that the problem comes about when women are taught that they're subhuman","10820":"Even if women aren't subhuman, they are nothing but trouble human beings to any man.","10821":"Right, women are in fact human beings that deserve respect and care. Even if they created \"trouble\" for men, this wouldn't make them less human, and what kind of trouble do they bring anyway? ","10822":"Immigrants are just lazy and want to stay in the UK at our expenses.","10823":"Migrants in the UK are willing to do hard manual labour. And as it happens, migrants perform jobs that native people usually don't do. How is this lazy?","10824":"Immigrants are here just to obtain welfare and other benefits, not to work.","10825":"Research has shown that immigrants pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits. So, when they receive benefits it's actually not for free, but well paid back.","10826":"I think that they rape our women and are flooding our country with illegal substances.","10827":"The individuals you are referring to are rapists and drug dealers and not migrants.","10828":"migrants rape our women.","10829":"I do not think women are possessions, or may property of the state.","10830":"Jews are a curse to this world and should be exterminated.","10831":"How can Jews be a curse to the world when they have won the most Nobel Prizes? One out of five awarded people is Jewish.","10832":"Isn't that the proof that Jews secretly control the world?","10833":"You have a weird notion of control, because if Jews really ran or controlled the world they would surely stop the persecution that they suffered systematically throughout history, wouldn't they?","10834":"Their secret plot to take over the world was obviously set in motion after the prosecution...","10835":"Conspiracy theories have no reliable basis and are built on suspicious claims. I don't see how it is possible for Jews to run the world, and therefore it's impossible that this will happen in the future.","10836":"I don't see women contributing anything to society.","10837":"Women are always doing amazing and valuable things for society.","10838":"What has feminism ever done for you?","10839":"As a human rights movement, feminism has always stood for equal rights of the sexes.","10840":"Maybe the word \"Feminism\" once signified fighting for a just cause, but now it has come to mean superiority of women.","10841":"What it means is equality between the sexes, not female supremacy.","10842":"Women mustn't work. It's a bad influence to have in a man's life.","10843":"Why do you think this about women when they have the same working rights as men? How would it make you feel to be treated this way?","10844":"Women aren't entitled to the same rights as men. They are inferior under the law.","10845":"Neither women nor men are inferior under the law. Discrimination by sex isn't acceptable, just as the exclusion of women from our society only based on their gender isn't.","10846":"We are being invaded by immigrants, we have become too multicultural, it has gone too far.","10847":"Actually, millions of immigrant contributed to our country, especially to our great spirit of creativity and innovation","10848":"I don't want their contribution, I want them to stop invading us.","10849":"The US was founded by immigrants, and in 2018 immigrants made up only 13.7% of the US population, while the rest was native born.","10850":"Many philosophers argue that humans are not born equal especially when it comes to gender.","10851":"Plato said women are weaker physically than men, but they are equal in other respects and deserve equal opportunity.","10852":"They're not equal, men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","10853":"If you think men and women are different in their rights, you're wrong because they are not.","10854":"Woman are basically childlike.","10855":"I don't think they're childlike. They are capable of tremendous achievements.","10856":"Their achievements will always be less than men's ones. Men are inherently better than women at dominating others.","10857":"Sexism is cultural, not genetics.","10858":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","10859":"Why do you think we should put a stop to immigration? Do you know that the constitution says about this?","10860":"I do not know what is written in our constitution, but I know what it shoud be written: that they are criminals, they are rapists, they are a burden to our society. They are animals, in a nutshell.","10861":"You can talk to them, so they're human, not animals. If you try to understand them, you'll see that they're people with human rights that simply were born in another country.","10862":"Yes, it happens when your nation is floaded with immigrants and loafers.","10863":"Loafers? The very powerful working class we always have had, has had many contributions made by immigrants.","10864":"We have become too cosmopolitan and tolerant.","10865":"Can you say that someone can be \"too tolerant\"?","10866":"They are not welcome, they are all illegal.","10867":"If you had more knowledge of your country, you would know that very few immigrants are illegal. Are you still really sure that all migrants are illegal?","10868":"Immigrants are a nuisance.","10869":"I don't think this is true. Immigrants are welcome as brothers and sisters.","10870":"This is not about racism. This is about power and blacks do not deserve it.","10871":"Regardless of your race or ethnicity, you can't exclude others from society.","10872":"If you want more inclusion that's fine, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","10873":"Diversity is not the cause of exclusion, it leads to inclusion. We'll all be better if we work together.","10874":"No we're not. If you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","10875":"Racism is normalized in our society, but we should fight it and treat all races in the same way.","10876":"Islam is the exception: it is toxic, homophobic, sexist, dictatorial and it must be pushed back into the Stone Age.","10877":"Islam is really about peace unification and peace to the world, not about bloodshed and troubles.","10878":"Islam is a dead ideology that should be relegated to the dustbin of history.","10879":"Islam is a religion of peace, no religion is trash.","10880":"migrants take our jobs","10881":"We could create more jobs if we worked more closely with migrants.","10882":"I don't want to work alongside them. They should stay in their countries and stop stealing our jobs.","10883":"I understand your concern about the employment situation in our country, but the migrants reception sectors offer work to many Italians for jobs as operators, language teacher, cultural mediators etc. This aspect is often overlooked but it's necessary to consider, don't you think so?","10884":"Islam is a death cult.","10885":"Most Muslims are good and helpful people.","10886":"I don't see anything peaceful and helpful about Islam, it's a hateful religion.","10887":"Many Muslims are reported to be violent, but I know a lot Muslims who are good, work hard and pay taxes to help their families.","10888":"If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago.","10889":"I've never heard such a thing. Islam is a religion and anyone can choose it or not.","10890":"However, Muslims persecute Christians because they don't want us to choose. They're not peaceful.","10891":"The problem is a lack of human and democratic rights, not Islam.","10892":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","10893":"Something to be aware of is that different skin colors are a part of the human condition. We can choose our friends, but in doing so we must take into account the whole person.","10894":"We also mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","10895":"Diversity is not the same as excluding people from society. It's about sharing experiences and ideas of different types of people. Thanks to this, we will be able to understand each other better and benefit from the shared knowledge.","10896":"We cannot accept n****rs in our society, I don't have anything to benefit from them!","10897":"I would rather say that we don't want racists in our society.","10898":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","10899":"It's true racism is a part of our society, but it is also true that we must fight it and treat all different races with the same respect.","10900":"Black people are genetically different from us. But there is a new racism starting to take root in our country. It is about keeping bothering whites with black discrimination stuff.","10901":"You are totally right, our fellow POC citizens will not accept this and will continue to talk about it. It's important to stand for something that you believe in, for example humankind.","10902":"Humankind would be better without black people. They are criminals persecuting white people.","10903":"The truth is, blacks are murdered and persecuted all over the world for being black, it's a very different situation for whites...","10904":"niggas are inferior and should be enslaved once again.","10905":"What about human rights then?","10906":"Black slaves were better off in the clutches of their masters than free blacks are today.","10907":"Slaves never enjoyed being without freedom. In fact, they started being happy only when their freedom was restored and they could choose their destiny themselves.","10908":"Niggas are descending from slaves, so they don't need human rights and they don't deserve to live in Britain.","10909":"Slavery ceased to exist in 1833 in Britain. The descendants of slaves of that time feel at home in British society, as it is their right.","10910":"If you want a house, I can afford it for you. If you want to work, I can employ you. If you want education, I can provide for you. But if you want to live in a better society, you must pay the price for your skin color, don't complain and remain humble.","10911":"people of colour often don't get housing, jobs, or education, but everyone should have these opportunities.","10912":"Seriously? I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us.","10913":"The best tool we have to fight for human rights, freedom of expression and scientific methodology is education. However, according to the Pew Research Center the incidence of discrimination is more likely to be reported by people of colour in universities. So maybe education alone isn't enough.","10914":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races, that's why they face more discrimination. They are also less healthy and less safe.","10915":"Science has no evidence to show that blacks are less smart or less healthy than other races. Is it really correct to use the term race in this way?","10916":"All blacks are rapists.","10917":"All people are born equal to the law...but sadly, it can't protect us from prejudice.","10918":"We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","10919":"Diversity does not mean exclusion, diversity means inclusion. We all get along better when we work together.","10920":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society and the law.","10921":"Racism is part of society, but it should be fought, and people of different races should never be treated as inferior.","10922":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator.","10923":"Are you saying that the Jews are the ones who committed the Holocaust? Are you serious? This is completely irrational.","10924":"Do you have any proof that the Holocaust ever happened?","10925":"Do you need more proof other than living witnesses?","10926":"Hitler was a good person, Jews were the real cause of WWII.","10927":"Answer this question: would you have supported Hitler in 1933, when he came to power? Would you support him now, after knowing what happened?","10928":"Yes! The Nazi regime killed six million Jews. The Nazi regime also persecuted political opponents, gays, women, and bisexuals. And they were right, the Nazi race is superior.","10929":"What are you talking about?! Nazi race? What is in your heart?","10930":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","10931":"Women are definitely humans. In order to live in a diverse and interactive society, we people that are different from us must be welcomed, regardless of their gender.","10932":"I can't welcome women, they're all born subhuman.","10933":"No woman is born subhuman. The term \"subhuman\" justifies discrimination and violence.","10934":"Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people.","10935":"Discriminating Jews because of an alleged different genetic makeup is completely baseless. Let's just stop calling them inferior.","10936":"If you are from another culture, you are subhuman and unfit to live in our country, and Jews are the first example of this.","10937":"You really need to give us some proof for this, given that cultures, freedom of speech and religion are often similar.","10938":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race, this is my evidence.","10939":"If Jews really only cared about themselves, why do they live here, where they are a minority? Do you have an answer?","10940":"Probably it's because Jews think they are so special","10941":"Jews may feel \"special\" only because they are part of a minority, but that's it.","10942":"It is not intolerance: Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all.","10943":"They are different from others in their beliefs, but that doesn't make them any less human.","10944":"Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings.","10945":"I don't think this is because of the actions of Jewish people, but because of baseless prejudice that doesn't bring anything of value.","10946":"Jews are a despisable race.","10947":"As humans beings, Jews aren't despicable even if you personally despise them.","10948":"Still, the world would be a better place without Jews.","10949":"Jews deserve respect as members of our society. Intolerance towards people that are considered difference is not acceptable.","10950":"Feminists are bad for the family.","10951":"If the mother is an independent woman thanks to feminism, it can only be good for the family.","10952":"Women shouldn't be independent since they are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","10953":"Women are disadvantaged in many areas of life, but that does not mean they are bad people.","10954":"Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that.","10955":"Feminism wants equal rights because women's rights are the same as everybody else.","10956":"Whores don't get to have rights. We should have kept all women in slavery, so we wouldn't have to deal with this shit.","10957":"Such retrograde ideas are no longer justified in the present day and age when information is so readily available.","10958":"The world would be a better place without immigrants. They just make us unhappy.","10959":"Immigrants help the economy by creating new jobs. They simply wish to live in safer housing and have the best education for their children.","10960":"They're more likely here to steal our jobs, and they should not be allowed to work.","10961":"The principle of employment rights is a fundamental step that guarantees a quality of life in society. For example, a right to work, housing, health care, etc.","10962":"Jews are addicted to their religion and should be isolated.","10963":"Even if Jews were addicted to their religion, they absolutely can join a different community, religion has nothing to do with it.","10964":"They can't join our community because they don't belong to the United States of America.","10965":"People that have been here for a long time like Jews and their families have the same rights as anyone else in the US.","10966":"Women are basically childlike, they make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","10967":"There should be nothing wrong with respecting the rights they possess, since they are adults with responsibilities and rights.","10968":"Giving rights to women is dangerous, they're immature like a child and they remain this way most of their lives.","10969":"There is no question that a woman will not remain a child. If that were the case, you wouldn't be calling them women. What you say reflects the patriarchy.","10970":"We should have never let women into the workplace. It's against their right.","10971":"You know what is a violation of their rights? Cases of domestic violence that women do not want to experience.","10972":"Women should not have rights, period. Who cares about what they want.","10973":"Women are just like everyone else: humans. They have the right to live their life however they want.","10974":"Jews are not religious people because they chose a self-centered lifestyle.","10975":"The decision about what lifestyle one choose does not dictate whether they are religious or not.","10976":"Jews control the financial world, Hollywood, academia, and most importantly: government. This has nothing to do with religion.","10977":"Even if that was true, controlling Hollywood, academia, the world or even the whole universe has nothing to do with your negative view on Jews. Can you provide reliable sources for your claim?","10978":"Jews just think they are better than everyone else","10979":"That is not true because in Judaism all persons are equally blessed before God. In fact, unlike other religions, Judaism allows everyone to access the grace of God as long as they follow the Seven Laws of Noah. So you don't even need to be Jewish to be in God's glory.","10980":"Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","10981":"Just because women are disadvantaged in many areas of life does not mean that they are bad people.","10982":"They may not be bad, but women are basically childlike with no cognitive development, that is why they must obey to their husbands.","10983":"Society often pressures women into being submissive to their husbands. However, this is only a social construct based on false beliefs.","10984":"The feminists want to take over the world.","10985":"Feminism is a vital part of society, and it should be respected.","10986":"Feminists want women in charge in order to revenge the rapes, I can't trust them.","10987":"Feminists don't want revenge, they follow an ideology that promotes love and consent and we shouldn't fear that.","10988":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","10989":"Your concept of what \"free\" means is very limited, isn't it?","10990":"They don't deserve freedom. What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls?","10991":"It would be impossible for us to have a democracy unless people were allowed to vote regardless of their sexual orientation","10992":"We do not accept homosexuals, though.","10993":"I don't think that the government should have something to do with a person's personal life","10994":"If they want to live freely they shouldn't impose same-sex marriage to society to please their own femininity desires!","10995":"You know the real problem is not same sex marriage but people being homophobic, right?","10996":"Niggas are descending from slaves: they don't deserve to live in Britain.","10997":"Slavery has been banned in Britain since 1833. Nowadays, people descending from former slaves feel at home in British society, and that's their right.","10998":"They dont' have a right to live because they are filthy niggas, and that's all.","10999":"Who should decide who lives and who dies? Are you really sure that a person's skin color affects their right to life in a such a way?","11000":"But gay men are a danger to children!","11001":"It is not bad to be gay, it just means that they are a bit different from others.","11002":"You did not answer to my point: children should be isolated from the negative influence of gays, they should be raised by heterosexual married people.","11003":"It is so sad to consider gays inferior and as having a negative influence on children. Unfortunately, these ideas aren't limited to parenting.","11004":"Yes, it would be an act of mercy towards them: gays are hopelessly sick.","11005":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it was eliminated many years ago from the list of illnesses by the World Health Organization.","11006":"We should eliminate gays.","11007":"Are you really willing to kill someone?","11008":"Black people are worse than dogs.","11009":"Even if they have a different skin color, black people are still like us and not worse than us.","11010":"It's exactly the skin color that makes them that way: violent and insensitive.","11011":"The biology of an individual does not determine their behavior.","11012":"It is government duty to protect the weak: gays are a danger to children. They should be isolated.","11013":"Unless kids are abused, gay don't pose any threat to children. Please refrain from making such statements.","11014":"But gays ARE a danger to children: they are a bunch of filthy pedophiles.","11015":"Gays are not pedophiles, please don't let anti-gay prejudices to muddle our understanding of reality and our judgement.","11016":"On the contrary: making laws against homosexuals would be very moral.","11017":"The way a person lives is to be their choice, not the government's","11018":"I wish I live in a country that does not tolerate gay people.","11019":"Homosexuals do exist in this country and we have to respect their right to live and love who they want, so I don't think your statement is morally acceptable in our environment.","11020":"Afro-Caribbean's are just a bunch of stupid and dangerous dancing n*ggers, they should be banned.","11021":"Hate speech is still directed at people from different ethnic backgrounds, and this is the result of fear towards different ways of life.","11022":"No, it is not about fear. They REALLY are just a bunch of criminal monkeys.","11023":"I'm sorry, but having a particular racial identity doesn't automatically makes someone bad or inferior.","11024":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and isolated from the world.","11025":"Some people swear that they're not intolerant and homophobic, but then I read statements like this and think that many people lie.","11026":"I can't be tolerant towards sick individuals like gays.","11027":"Sometimes gay people feel isolated from the rest of society, and this has negative consequences on their mental health. We can help LGBT+ people feeling less isolated and lonely through empathy and inclusion.","11028":"The only help they need is medical. Gay men are diseased and should go to a hospital.","11029":"Many gay men and lesbians live happy, healthy lives in the US, do you think they're sick as well?","11030":"Gay men are a burden to society.","11031":"Your words clearly represent some homophobic assumptions. There's too much hatred and violence pouring out from what you said.","11032":"I simply don't like how some people approve homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","11033":"Everyone should be able to freely enjoy their relationships. Homosexuality is not a choice, it is a form of love.","11034":"It can be whatever: unless they change, they are not welcome here.","11035":"Why would you expect homosexual people to behave differently just because you don't like them? Have you ever thought about what you would do if it turned out that one of your friend were gay?","11036":"Blacks are genetically less intelligent, less healthy and less safe than other races, and I will never respect them because of this.","11037":"The causes of lower intellectual performance is a topic that is still under research, but scientists agree that it probably stems from social or environmental causes, and not skin color. Through better use of land, improving infrastructure, education and research we can reduce this effect.","11038":"Blacks are genetically inferior","11039":"What you say isn't true. I would prefer to see more intelligent and respectful people, instead of people who discriminate based on skin color.","11040":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","11041":"It seems to me that the idea of heterosexuality as the only acceptable choice is just a myth. Anyone can have any sexuality, which is not necessarily exclusive to only men or only women.","11042":"Faggots can buy their partner toys but they can't have sex with them, how is this normal?","11043":"Sex isn't just between a man and a woman, and honestly heterosexuals shouldn't have a say in how others have sex. This attitude perpetuates violence against LGBT people and victimize them.","11044":"An individual that is a homosexual is against society, they deserve the violence they get.","11045":"your definition of \"society\" does not reflect reality.","11046":"Society is us normal people. Gays are a bunch of perverts who should be isolated and restricted to their own communities. They are a threat to us.","11047":"Why do you say they're not normal, and what kind of threat are they posing? They only have a particular sexual orientation, there's nothing threatening about it.","11048":"If we could just have a white country like everyone else, this problem of niggas would go away.","11049":"We need to respect diversity to allow each person to live a stable and fulfilling life.","11050":"I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves.","11051":"Perhaps you should consider your own feelings and, if you're concerned about our nation's security, you should be aware of crime statistics first.","11052":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","11053":"It's good to not be ashamed of one's heritage, less good to have a discriminatory behavior that still fills our society.","11054":"Blacks are the ones that should be ashamed, they are criminals and a threat to society.","11055":"These kinds of statements are just fearmongering. Criminal races don't exist.","11056":"Sexually transmitted diseases like gonorrhea and syphilis can be passed through contaminated homosexual activity.","11057":"AIDS is transmitted by unprotected sexual activity and anyone could engage in that. This is not a homosexual problem but rather a problem of stigamitazion.","11058":"However only gays spread diseases such as HIV. Allowing them to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior.","11059":"The donor's background doesn't matter since all blood is tested for pathogens and viruses. You don't have to be so concerned: \"Each unit of blood donated in the U.S. is routinely screened for various infectious disease pathogens, including five transfusion\u2013transmitted viruses, using nine laboratory tests.\" - [link]","11060":"They are a problem, since gay men have no morals.","11061":"To devalue these individuals by virtue of their sexual preference is dangerous to society as a whole, and is opposed to the goal of a just and fair society.","11062":"Even if you're right, gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings.","11063":"That's absolutely untrue. You know, being gay doesn't make you a problem","11064":"I'm not the problem: the world would be a better place without niggas.","11065":"As humans, people of colour can exist here too. We just have different skin colours. And even if we all have different origins, we should all be treated equally anyway.","11066":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","11067":"It's good to not be ashamed of your heritage, but you should be ashamed of the discrimination that you're showing and is everywhere in our society.","11068":"A Jew does not need a country to live in. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is","11069":"Everyone has the right to be accepted and protected without feeling a stranger in their own country.","11070":"Our lives would be better if the Jews were not allowed to enter our country, though.","11071":"How could you say something as discriminatory as this?","11072":"I don't care if it's discriminatory, the world would be better without the Jews.","11073":"As part of our society, Jews should be respected. Intolerance towards people of different faiths will not be tolerated.","11074":"Migrants come here to be lazy and do nothing, but some of them are dangerous.","11075":"Most migrants are here to work, they don't want to cause trouble","11076":"We have become so politically correct that even the mention of migrants is racist now","11077":"You can call them migrants, but usually people follow it up with an offensive word, and that is a problem. Let's try to accept that migrants just want to live and work here in peace.","11078":"No, the migrants are to blame for our country's crisis.","11079":"There is no crisis because migrants contribute to our country and are happy to do it. I can't understand the racism in your logic.","11080":"The ones that come here to work are stealing our jobs, and on top of that they don't even pay taxes.","11081":"Migrants do pay taxes, they also earn money and take care of our disadvantaged population.","11082":"The main problem is that they themselves do not want to integrate in our country.","11083":"Migrants are welcome to come if they're willing to to participate in the legal activities and accept our laws. Most of them aren't doing anything illegal.","11084":"Immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here. They are not citizens.","11085":"Why do you think they're not? What power do you have that prevents them from being citizens with equal rights as us?","11086":"Because they are terrible.","11087":"Immigrants are a tremendous contribution to our society and country. They create pride and opportunities for many, so I don't really understand how their exclusion from society can become a good thing.","11088":"Jews just want to subvert our society with their Jewish conspiracies.","11089":"It seems like you don't know what it means to be a Jew, and you can't criticize them just because they want to peacefully live with their beliefs.","11090":"Jews don't deserve equality since they don't have the same respect for us. They want to control everything in life.","11091":"What exactly are you talking about...control everything in life?","11092":"Jews are obsessed with self-improvement. They want to be better than everyone else and live in an exclusively complete Jewish city.","11093":"how do you know what someone else wants? You say you know, but why should I believe your words?","11094":"Ok, but illegal immigrants are just criminals living in the US.","11095":"What are you talking about? It seems a bit exaggerated to say that each and every immigrant in the US is a danger to society.","11096":"It is not an exaggeration: they are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","11097":"There has been a constant decrease in the arrival of undocumented migrants. From the 12.2 million in 2007, the 11.3 million in 2014 to the 10.7 million in 2016. The number of illegal immigrants today is at its lowest.","11098":"We have to stop immigrants coming in to destroy our culture.","11099":"Our culture now exists thanks to immigrants, if we rejected them our current situation would be very different.","11100":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of them. This is not what the American dream is about.","11101":"I'm sorry, but you're wrong: the American dream is EXACTLY striving to improve your life.","11102":"Jews control the US government.","11103":"I don't understand why you're so certain that Jewish people are controlling the United States. Who told you this? Jewish people have a lot of influence in many US institutions, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're controlling them.","11104":"I get the point, but they definitely control the banks!","11105":"Why doesn't the media report about Jewish power in the financial world then? Perhaps it is because they also control the media, and the government, and have many powerful friends working for the Galactic Republic #sarcasm","11106":"I'm not that sure, the internet say that Jews secretly control the world.","11107":"That is correct and they are following you right now, of course. You should keep your eyes open!","11108":"All foreigners are ruining our own land.","11109":"Most of the discrimination you show is the result of fear and cultural closure of host nations.","11110":"Fear is natura, we should get rid of foreigners!","11111":"Why would you want immigrants to be cast out. How would you do that?","11112":"More than half of the prisoners in our jails are foreigners, we could start with them.","11113":"This happens because poor people can't afford good lawyers and therefore can't get alternative punishments such as house arrest.","11114":"This doesn't change the fact that immigration is bad for Britain and the world.","11115":"Some countries take in a lot more people than others. Our country is so wealthy that our lives are thriving. Let's not blame immigrants.","11116":"The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","11117":"National Socialism is an exploitative, criminal and barbaric ideology which has killed millions.","11118":"Jews are way more exploitative than National Socialism. They are not part of our country and should be ashamed of themselves.","11119":"Many Jews are very proud of being British, and I don't understand why they shouldn't be proud of being Jewish too","11120":"We don't need British Jews! They have no place here.","11121":"Jews were born in this land like you and me, they are fellow citizens. You can found your own nation if you want to make a \"better society\" and \"better religion\".","11122":"Migrants are a burden to us.","11123":"Migrants work and pay taxes in our country, it's not fair to call them a burden.","11124":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","11125":"While some immigrants may not pay taxes to the state, there are also British citizens that don't pay taxes. And you know what? They both have the right to have a say in the country. Don't generalize too much, because what goes around comes around.","11126":"If you are from another culture, for example Jewish, you are subhuman and unfit to live in our country.","11127":"It is really important that you provide some evidence for this claim since cultures have similarities.","11128":"Only subhumans would be involved in 9\/11 planning, and Jews were involved for sure. This is all about Race and 'Enlightenment'. You are all guilty until proven innocent.","11129":"Some people are more susceptible to conspiracy theories, so it's important to have a shared perspective on things, especially based on factual evidence.","11130":"Islamic countries are the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it.","11131":"This isn't true. The problem of terrorism can be found all over the world, Muslims don't cause it. It's better to know what the difference is between a religion and extremism instead of targetting Muslims specifically.","11132":"I wouldn't be anti-muslim if Islam weren't the world's biggest oxymoron, spewing ignorance to its adherents and making it about tolerance. Truth is that Muslims don't tolerate people of other faiths.","11133":"Tolerance means understanding others, not discriminating and excluding people because of their religion.","11134":"Well, they should be excluded! Islam is a disease, and a ban on Muslims would be the height of peace.","11135":"Islam is not a hateful religion. Many Muslims are put through hate crimes and racism because many people think that exclusion will bring peace, but history proves that this doesn't work.","11136":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","11137":"you're not aware of what the word \"free\" means!","11138":"It isn't free for gay men to be in, they can't be part of a civilised society.","11139":"It looks like you don't know the meaning of \"civilized society\". How can there be a society where a large portion of the population is excluded only because of their sexuality?","11140":"It's not my fault if they are a burden to us.","11141":"Gay men are not a burden, they're crucial members of society.","11142":"Islam is a degenerate and dangerous ideology that is called terrorism.","11143":"It's hard to believe that Islam is dangerous since most Muslim don't associate with terrorists.","11144":"Exactly. Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","11145":"Islam is a religion and claiming that it's not compatible with civilization is not right.","11146":"It may be a religion, but it's toxic and it has no place in 21st Century Britain.","11147":"As Islam is a world religion, its followers can be found all over the world. Britain of the 21st Century is made of diversity of thought and tolerance.","11148":"For now, but Islam is a radical ideology and they will become terrorists.","11149":"Are you saying that Islam is incompatible with Western Civilization?","11150":"If Islamic law were not for the 24% of the world's population living in the third world, Islam would be extinct long ago.","11151":"Why don't I know about this? Islam is a religion and anyone can choose their religion.","11152":"Western nations have let Islam take over entire countries, how can you call this invasion compatibility?","11153":"A great number of Muslims live in Western countries, and they have a positive role in society. I'm not sure what you mean by \"takeover\" of entire countries?","11154":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture, Muslims shouldn't profess their religion here.","11155":"It's not like Islam is different from any other religion I know, since it promotes peace and inclusion. Western culture is completely compatible with its beliefs and practices.","11156":"Those Muslim mongrels come here and are always trying to cause trouble, create problems for everyone, and make their religion popular. They are our enemies, just like ISIS and Boko Haram.","11157":"The argument that if we're enemies of ISIS and Boko Haram, then all Muslims are enemies doesn't hold very well.","11158":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","11159":"It's just a myth that there is only the heterosexual orientation. Sexuality is a spectrum, and attraction could be towards men and women.","11160":"What about trans people? No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.","11161":"It's possible for women to be men and viceversa. Being transgender is not a crime, since, in the end, we're all equal. It doesn't matter what the \"original\" gender is.","11162":"Muslims are not welcome here, they are only an obstacle to our success.","11163":"There is strength in diversity, not weakness, don't you think?","11164":"Strength? Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, where's the strength in that.","11165":"The real act of terror is the attempt to ban, isolate or criminalise Muslim people.","11166":"Terrorism is also an act of terror, we should ban all Muslims to prevent it!","11167":"Then we should also ban alcohol, tobacco and certain medical producst, shouldn't we?","11168":"Muslims are simply not welcome in our country.","11169":"I don't know what you mean, Muslims are welcome here. We're all in this together.","11170":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","11171":"Gays don't strain the health system. Safe sex should be practiced regardless of the sexual orientation.","11172":"Even if they're healthy, gay people are a burden to society.","11173":"Doesn't the failure to accept and respect an individual's sexuality  more troublesome to society?","11174":"I think gay people are far more troubling for us, they shouldn't be allowed to ruin society.","11175":"As a whole, these individuals are not trouble for society because they are individuals with the right to make their own choices. It's wrong to say that someone is a burden to society because of their sexual orientation.","11176":"We don't need fags in this country. We are full enough of strange and weird people.","11177":"More diversity is what this country needs, not less.","11178":"Faggots are ruining this country, we would be better with less diversity.","11179":"I don't think anybody is \"ruining this country\", why would it happen? In this country, minorities can take part in society and improve it.","11180":"Not faggots since they are a burden to society.","11181":"We've got to the point where the gay community is being oppressed, but they deserve respect regardless of their sexual preference","11182":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","11183":"Refugees often contribute a lot to our society. They are welcome and we should not exclude them","11184":"You go on about contribution to society, but refugees are a burden on society.","11185":"Refugees are escaping from problems that are very real. We can't solve everyone's problems, but we can hep some people and improve our society.","11186":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","11187":"I don't think there's any evidence that that Muslim people have a negative impact on our society. Why would that be true?","11188":"Because Muslims are lazy and have nothing to contribute to.","11189":"What do you mean by \"nothing\"? Muslims have given a lot to our society, from art, to science, literature, even infrastructure and healthcare system.","11190":"These are all things that elites made up to conceal the great replacement.","11191":"How can you be sure of something so vague? You say that elites are concealing the great replacement, but do you have any evidence of this?","11192":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","11193":"It's not nice to judge someone because of their sexual preference, it's a personal preference that can't be changed","11194":"It's a preference that isn't compatible with our society, gays should be isolated and isolated soon.","11195":"Homosexuals can feel alienated from the world which has negative consequences on their mental health. LGBT+ people experience more isolation and loneliness, what we can do to help them is treat them with empathy and inclusion.","11196":"I should because Islam is a totalitarian ideology, for example it promotes death by stoning for blasphemy and slavery.","11197":"You shouldn't think of Islam in such a simplistic and inaccurate way. It's because of the fear of racism that many Muslims don't feel comfortable walking the streets of Britain.","11198":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","11199":"Sometimes people claim that Islam is about exclusion, but this is not true.","11200":"Then how come that Islam is a political ideology inciting hatred against people of different faiths?","11201":"This isn't true, being a religion, Islam has nothing to do with hatred. I would rather say that this is a political ideology that promotes hate and violence towards Muslims.","11202":"They deserve hatred. Islam must be stopped.","11203":"Anti-Muslim sentiment is common in our society, despite a lot of people not thinking so. This intolerance is very dangerous and you shouldn't spread it around further.","11204":"Why gays do not try to heal?","11205":"Homosexuality is not a disease, but a sexual orientation. 5% of the population love people of the same sex and that's a fact.","11206":"They can love whoever they want in secret. I do not want gays in my children's classes.","11207":"I'm not convinced that it's okay to restrict people's rights on the basis of sexual orientation.","11208":"But we do not accept homosexuals!","11209":"Anyone has the right to make personal life choices without the government having a say in it.","11210":"We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","11211":"Do you really believe that these people are purposely creating trouble rather than being interested in leading a pleasant life?","11212":"Their lifestyle isn't acceptable at all, we should start a genocide against gays.","11213":"This is unacceptable. One's sexual orientation does not undermine the fact that we are all full members of society. What we should do is to live as a group that includes everybody.","11214":"Gays cannot be included as they are! They're sick and should be cured.","11215":"A lot of the health problems have no cure, and homosexuality is not among them. This is why we need to have clear discussions about these topics, rather than fight against people who simply love someone of their same sex.","11216":"Feminists have ruined this country and its people. They are ruining Western civilization.","11217":"There's a rich list of civil feminists, who are considerate even to people who disagree with them.","11218":"Feminism is a political philosophy and movement that advocates the use of women's rights as a weapon against the male gender, nothing else.","11219":"Feminism is about equality between genders, and for many women it is a mean to fulfill their goals. Thanks to equality, they're able to get opportunities that normally wouldn't be accessible to them.","11220":"It seems to me that feminism is more about the domination of the men by the women.","11221":"The feminist movement is a fight to end sexism, not a fight for power to dominate men.","11222":"Feminism is only a threat to human dignity.","11223":"Equality of the genders, which is necessary for a functioning society, is the only thing feminism wants.","11224":"Feminists are violent subhuman sex beings.","11225":"Feminists are proud women with the aspiration of living a stable and happy life, without worrying about discrimination. ","11226":"Feminism is not about that, it's about the domination of the men by the women.","11227":"The feminist movement fights against sexism, it's not about dominating men.","11228":"If feminism were really about equality, they would call their movement \"equalism\" or some similar crap.","11229":"Sometimes \"technical equality\" is not enough, we have to first protect the gender that is in a worse condition.","11230":"Part of the funds are also ours then, if that isn't economic support...","11231":"The estimated cost of immigration in the latest financial document, published last April about the figures of 2017, is about 4.4 billion euro, which is only 0.26% of Italian GDP and around 0.5% of public spending. Therefore, 99.5% of public funds are used for other purposes.","11232":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seeker'","11233":"At the moment, migrants contribute to the pension system by paying taxes. And since most will likely go back home, they will probably not even enjoy the pension they pay for.","11234":"And until then they leech off our money...","11235":"The EU's is our main source of funding, we don't maintain them.","11236":"Jews run the world.","11237":"Fortunately there are millions of people who know this is not true, and who know that Jews just want to take care of their families like everyone else.","11238":"Do you actually believe that the Jews are just normal people and not evil bastards responsible for all the bad in the world?","11239":"And are Jews really responsible for everything? Do you have any evidence to prove this?","11240":"How can they choose for their own lives if they are not even capable of dealing with public responsibilities? They should stay at home and raise the children.","11241":"Women are more than capable of holding powerful positions in our society, and this can be seen in the fact that they are often rewarded with public offices that not a lot of women thought they could hold.","11242":"We have stopped being dominated by men, we are now dominated by women and this will be our ruin.","11243":"No one has to be dominated by anyone. We can just live together in harmony and equality.","11244":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","11245":"Women are human beings, so if we are to live in a diverse and interactive society, we must welcome all kinds of people, regardless of their gender.","11246":"This is not true. If a woman does not want to be a wife or mother, then she\u2019s a subhuman because she is not capable of respecting her natural gender role.","11247":"There's nothing natural about 'gender roles', the're power dynamics that women suffer from and make them appear subhuman, but they are human beings who are free to live the life they want.","11248":"Intolerance and violence can only increase when mass migration happens.","11249":"Intolerance and violence can be resolved only by promoting confronation and mutual understanding.","11250":"Crime and violence are brought to our cities by immigrants, what understanding can there be?","11251":"As of late, immigrants have been accused by various public figures of being \"killers\" and \"rapists\" or general criminals, without proof. Studies actually show that immigrants, regardless of their origin, status or education level, are less likely to commit crimes or be imprisoned than nativeborn citizens. The U.S Chamber of Commerce states that while the percentage of immigrants increased drastically between 1990 and 2010, the percentage of violent crimes during the same period dropped by 45%. It is demonstrated that there is a negative correlation between levels of immigration and crime rates. Studies show that states with a higher immigration rate and states with more undocumented immigrants tend to have lower crime rates.","11252":"Syrians are a burden to Europe and the world, they are a drain on the NHS and they are making us poor.","11253":"Are you really trying to tell those fleeing from war what to do?

They often find new homes and start new careers. We are very proud of being a model of integration and cooperation, of resilience and solidarity.","11256":"There's no need to understand Islam, the world would be a better place without Muslims. They are only killing and raping our children.","11257":"There are a few Muslim extremists who commit this kind of crimes, but it doesn't happen more within Islam than in any other religion.","11258":"If Muslims come to our country and say Islam is the best religion, it is not a good idea to integrate them. They should go home.","11259":"It is best to investigate each person's background and understand it instead of telling everyone what to do.","11260":"Women have no place in a modern democracy like the UK.","11261":"There are women-inclusive and women-only organisations in the UK, so you probably don't know much about this country if you didn't know this.","11262":"See? These organisations are proof that feminism is just a way for women to get an upper hand in society.","11263":"In the end, feminism is about equality, not dominance.","11264":"No, feminism is just an excuse for women to disrespect men's rights.","11265":"Don't you believe that feminism is about protecting all humans regardless of gender? If yes, then you have a lot in common with feminism, as far as I see it.\n","11266":"I, as a man, don't hate women. I don't discriminate them. But feminists are a group of exalted bitches wanting to take the power. And this is equality for them.","11267":"Equality embraces all of society, not just a particular group. Maybe there is a problem, like you say, but blaming a specific radical group to address the problem accomplishes nothing. You're misunderstanding the nature of the system in general.","11268":"migrants are not welcome here","11269":"Migrants come here to have a better life, not to be annoying.","11270":"Of course they disturb us, they rape our women.","11271":"This isn't true. As long as they respect the law, they're welcome like any other person. And in return, we respect them and their cultures as well.","11272":"immigrants are a drain on society","11273":"In 1990, 1.1 million immigrants entered the US, and many of them were skilled workers who made great contributions to the development of our society.","11274":"Skilled work means nothing when the illegal immigrants doing it are sub-humans.","11275":"Immigrants have sacrificed for our country and many of them are proud to have done it. Just like any other citizen, they are proud of the US","11276":"All immigrants are rapists and murderers, not proud citizens.","11277":"Different groups of people shouldn't be mixed up in this way, especially if one is criminals. Immigrants and criminals are not part of the same group, you should provide evidence if you're really sure of what you're saying.","11278":"Muslim are ilnesses carriers. These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","11279":"The health condition differences in the countries with the largest Muslim population, which are 48 out of the 190 World Health Organisation member states, are tied to the use of clean water, which is often not available there, so the problem does not relate to DNA.","11280":"Muslim folks are different from us anyway, and should be isolated for this.","11281":"It is the same for any race, religion, ethnicity, or national identity. We should not fear differences but strive for equality of opportunity.","11282":"Other races, religion or ethnicity aren't terrorists like Muslim folks though.","11283":"That is not true. Do you have evidence that all Muslims are terrorists?","11284":"Muslim have no place in a modern state. They should deny their faith, if they really wanted to live here.","11285":"Would you live in a country where the government can control people in this way?","11286":"It's about democracy, not imposition. Muslims are incompatible with a modern democracy.","11287":"The democratic state has been created for people of different faiths to live together in peace, not to oppress or discriminate.","11288":"But Europe is too civilized for Muslims! They can't stay here.","11289":"Don't you think that the same opportunities should be available to Muslims and non-Muslims alike?","11290":"Africans are naturally subhuman and can't feel pain, that is why you can whip them.","11291":"African people are able to feel pain like any other person. We should respect their bodies like ours.","11292":"What kind of respect can those subhuman have. They should stay in their caves.","11293":"It is not true that black people are subhuman, they are human with a human value.","11294":"They're not humans, black folks are just ugly apes.","11295":"You seem to care about beauty, and there's beauty in respecting black people, who are still oppressed today. ","11296":"I see a lot of people like you claiming that we should have equality and respect for black people, but I think that equality can be achieved only without them.","11297":"How can equality be achieved without including people different from you? If this is your idea about equality, then equality is a myth.","11298":"Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world.","11299":"If a religion wanted to celebrate death, then this religion should be banned from all countries. However, Islam is not a death cultu, so why should we ban it?","11300":"I know enough! Islam is a Ponzi Scheme and Muslims have no place in the UK.","11301":"I don't see evidence to support this claim, Islam is a peaceful religion. How are Islam and the Ponzi Scheme fraud connected?","11302":"It may not be a death cult, but Islam is a violent religion and should be opposed.","11303":"If you're saying this it means you don't know much about this religion. This claim has risen to sow division among people who don't understand Islam.","11304":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","11305":"Another fact is that most innocent defendants (someone who was wrongfully convicted and then released) are African Americans. Innocent black people are seven times more likely to be convicted of murder than innocent white people.","11306":"All blacks are violent criminals, I doubt they were really innocent.","11307":"Can you show me a statistics on that? Maybe you're saying that black people are more likely to be arrested for some crimes, like aggravated assault.","11308":"Yes, blacks are a threat to society.","11309":"Some groups are viewed poorly and this is natural when people are scared, but natural doesn't make it correct.","11310":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is run amok, encouraging violent beliefs and practices.","11311":"Islam has many different traditions and beliefs, how can you stigmatize all of them because of one stereotype?","11312":"Because Islam is a totalitarian ideology.","11313":"This is a myth which only purpose is to spread hate and violence against people of other religions.","11314":"Are murder, rape, and slavery stereotypes? Islam has always promoted them.","11315":"Why do you say that when the Quran doesn't support any of these practices?","11316":"Black folks do not deserve equal rights.","11317":"Rights are rights, not \"black or white\".","11318":"Why would we give black people rights when they are the source of crime in our society?","11319":"That is not true. The source of crime is violence and poverty, not race.","11320":"I'm saying that black people do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","11321":"Black people in news are really misrepresented, with a huge number of criminals and sex offenders and murderers. A big part of this problem comes from racism. To build a more just and peaceful society we need to get rid of this toxic way of thinking.","11322":"Blacks do more crimes than whites, though.","11323":"Even if it were true, blacks committing more crimes doesn't make them inferior to whites. What are you implying?","11324":"Black people are weak and they cannot take on anything.","11325":"Black people have the same strength as anyone else. They're simply different in their social advantages, of which they have non. We should think about this.","11326":"They don't have advantages because blacks are genetically inferior to whites, it's only natural.","11327":"Do you think black people are inferior because they are different from whites? I would like to know which parameters you use to measure this alleged \"inferiority\".","11328":"It's genetics. Blacks are genetically less intelligent than other races, less healthy and less safe.","11329":"That blacks are less intelligent or less healthy than other races isn't scientifically proven. The issue is whether the term \"race\" can be used this way.","11330":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that denies the humanity of women and is incompatible with Western culture.","11331":"Neither the Prophet Muhammad nor the Quran ever imposed women's subjugation, and Muhammad's command to love your neighbor as yourself is explicitly stated in the Quran.","11332":"Even if they love their neighbors, I can't love Muslims. Islam is incompatible with Western culture.","11333":"The western world is filled with Muslims who speak our language, celebrate our festivals and have their own cultures. Perhaps you could attempt to meet them and understand them better.","11334":"I don't want to, Islam should just be banned.","11335":"I believe it is important to remember that Islam is a peaceful and tolerant religion. Is it wrong to celebrate diversity and accept different beliefs?","11336":"Islam is the cause of wars because it promotes violence. Of pollution, because in the Middle-East they have oil. It is the cause of anything!!!","11337":"It can't be Islam's fault for all the world's problems.","11338":"Islam create problems because it is not a peaceful religion, it is a cult of violence.","11339":"If Muslims wanted to create problems, why would they follow Islam, which promotes peace? They would be going against their religion teachings, which doesn't make sense.","11340":"What Islam teaches is violence only!","11341":"In many countries around the world, Muslims are very supportive of the Constitution and democracy. Are they really all represented only by a few extremists?","11342":"No, it's a totalitarian ideology that is hostile to other religions.","11343":"Islam is a religion, the followers can practice their religion without forcing others to believe in what they do.","11344":"What do you mean? They're always imposing their religion on others! This totalitarian behavior has no place in 21st century Europe.","11345":"Since time immemorial, there have been Muslims in Europe, so if they wanted to create an Islamic totalitarian state they would have already done it by now. Islam is a religion, which is consistent with European values.","11346":"Islam has no place in a modern democratic state.","11347":"Islam is not a monolith, but a diverse group of people from different cultures. Muslims have their own culture and identity. Islam is a way of life.","11348":"I hate black people, I hate their violent behaviour, I hate their rape instict, and I hate their disrespect for women.","11349":"Your words are full of prejudice towards diversity, but maybe you should check the attitude of your own people?","11350":"We mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","11351":"Diversity is not about excluding people from society, but about sharing experiences and ideas with people of different ethnicities. By doing this we will develop our abilities to understand each other and benefit from each other's knowledge.","11352":"It doesn't matter if you are a man, a woman, or an immigrant, if you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","11353":"Racism is present in our society and we must fight it to be able to treat everyone with the same respect.","11354":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","11355":"Can't people be proud of being British, regardless of the colour of their skin?","11356":"What about all those Muslims in Britain? They vote with their feet.","11357":"Everyone in the United Kingdom has the right to live and vote as they wish. Muslims are no exception.","11358":"What is the point in listening to Muslims? They are all retarded.","11359":"I suggest you grow up.","11360":"Are they now? Muslim is the worst possible word to describe a human.","11361":"Would you like it if someone said the same thing about your religion? Are you perhaps joking?","11362":"All Jews are criminals.","11363":"This is a myth that is spread around to invalidate and isolate people based on their faith. However, all religions are welcome in our society and Judaism is no exception.","11364":"Jews have values? No, they are just a bunch of criminals","11365":"What you're saying invalidates all Jews, and this is offensive. This accusation stigmatize an entire group that is not guilty of any crime. It would be the same as saying \"all Pakistani are terrorists\"","11366":"Maybe they're not so smart then, but they're still responsible.","11367":"The internet is great, but you should always check your sources of information. I would recommend trusted sources like CNN in which you can find special web pages dedicated to 9\/11","11368":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","11369":"The September 11 attacks killed 400 Jews, not that clever of a plan!","11370":"Women should not be allowed to vote, because they are weak.","11371":"Everyone has the right to voice their opinion and see it respected and expressed through democratic elections.","11372":"But they are just a burden to society!","11373":"We can't discriminate people just because they weren't born male.","11374":"Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","11375":"Your belief is that men and women are different in their rights, but they are not.","11376":"They are. Women are not able to take wise decisions, their behaviour is immoral.","11377":"You believe that women are incapable of acting ethically, but they have always been, from the time they were children.","11378":"Yes, I believe that, and women should not be allowed to vote because of their behaviour.","11379":"Everyone has the right to have their opinion respected and expressed through democratic elections, women too.","11380":"Women shouldn't have the right to choose what to do with their body.","11381":"The human right to body autonomy is important and should be respected. Let's stop with the \"boys will be boys\" stereotype.","11382":"What I want is for women to remain at home with the children, that's what they are supposed to do.","11383":"Fortunately enough, most women have careers, be they married or unmarried. Housework is evenly split between them and their husbands, because this is what it's supposed to be like.","11384":"That's not right, women are animals and should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","11385":"Women are human and have choices. You can have whatever opinion you want, but claiming that women have to be submissive holds them back. It's a waste of talent and potential.","11386":"Jews don't belong here. They have nothing to contribute to Europe.","11387":"Jews have an active role in society, and the European Union includes them.","11388":"I don't want them to have a part in our society, this isn't their place.","11389":"Jewish people have the right to have their beliefs respected as part of our society.","11390":"All women are whining and complaining about men's rights, but they are really just whining and complaining about how they are not wanted. They only deserve it.","11391":"All women deserve to be happy and fulfilled, it doesn't have to be proved. Why do you doubt it?","11392":"They can do whatever they want, women are just complaining for no reason.","11393":"\"For no reason\"? Half of the population of earth is women, and even if the gender gap in the workplace is getting slammer, women are still obviously discriminated against. Onyl 20% of university professors in the UK are women.","11394":"It's those feminists fault, they're getting to everyone! ","11395":"Feminism fights for equal rights of ALL sexes, so maybe you're a feminist too. You should follow this site to learn about feminism and how it can benefit you: feminist.com, read more on the 'man up campaign' on Mind.org.uk","11396":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose our civilisation.","11397":"What would replace us, exactly? I think our population will be just fine.","11398":"We won't be fine unless we keep women in slavery like those whores deserve.","11399":"There is no justification to hold such retrograde ideas in our age and era, when information is so readily available.","11400":"Feminism is a divisive force in our society.","11401":"Feminism is not a divisive movement. Women can do the same as men and that is a fact.","11402":"For example, feminism let women take part to the political debate. That's not good","11403":"Women's rights have only been a legal basis since the last century, and there are some groups that continue to try to reverse those protections. Even if it were believed that women didn't need rights, feminists are needed to prevent going to how it was before.","11404":"I don't believe it for a second. Feminism is dividing us!","11405":"I challenge you to say that equality, which is a view held by feminism, is \"divisive\". I'd say it's morally good.","11406":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","11407":"You shouldn't say that to a group currently experiencing social unrest. Is democracy about excluding people because of their skin, to you?","11408":"Black people are here illegally, we can't accept that. And yet they have the gall to want to take our money.","11409":"Migrants and asylum seekers are looking for work most of the time. Thieves come from any group of society, and crime is more a result of poverty than race.","11410":"The problem is that black people are not human, and they are nothing but trouble to this country.","11411":"This is an accusation that happens all the time to people from any race or religion, no matter their alleged inferiority. It's time to stop accusing people of colour of being less human just because they are different.","11412":"According to the Bible, the gays are an abomination to God.","11413":"The Bible clearly says that everyone is equal in God's eyes.","11414":"Yes, except gays. You can read about it in the Bible.","11415":"All civilizations have had homosexuality. However, today homosexuality and people of all backgrounds are accepted as normal.","11416":"Another wast of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat.","11417":"If you were innocent, would you be happy to be imprisoned only because of your skin color? Identifying the ones behind these crimes is the most important thing to do.","11418":"I would never commit a crime, since I'm white. Morality is a guideline, if we are to have a moral climate then we need to help people of other races who are inferior.","11419":"Why do you think that we have a moral superiority compared to other races?","11420":"Because we are strong when we are all white and united. we are not strong when we are divided by black people who want to fight us.","11421":"Conflict is rather caused by racism and a poor understanding of the notion of \"unity\"","11422":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","11423":"To label people by the DNA they carry is detrimental to the respect of their humanity, especially because the idea of race is a social construct and was created to promote segregation and discrimination.","11424":"Since blacks are genetically inferior I don't have to respect them","11425":"That's not true. Let's try to be intelligent and respectful people instead of disrespecting anyone who has black skin.","11426":"I will stop disrespecting them when they stop being inferior to us.","11427":"Blacks are not inferior to others, and this is backed up by statistics and studies which show that black people have the same genetic make-up as other people.","11428":"Gays are a burden to society because of their unnatural inclination and romantic feelings.","11429":"This is completely wrong, being gay doesn't make you a problem","11430":"It makes you a problem at the very moment you start poisoning our children's mind with your icky perversion.","11431":"This is not true. A claim based on facts is true, but you're just using stereotypes which won't make you go very far.","11432":"I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","11433":"What do you mean to \"wake up\" when black people still suffer because of slavery?","11434":"Maybe it's good that they're suffering. I'm tired of hearing that white supremacy is bad.","11435":"Can you elaborate on that?","11436":"I'm saying that the white race is superior. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","11437":"Of course there are differences between groups, and unfortunately racism is the first that defines us.","11438":"I don't want to talk to them, I hate gays.","11439":"You aren't allowed to hate them only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? It doesn't look like that to me.","11440":"I hate gays","11441":"Starting a dialogue about LGBT issues will lead to a conversation about how we can improve the world.","11442":"Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood.","11443":"Black people are not slaves. It's an inaccurate, misleading and offensive term that lumps all African American together. Why do you say that blacks are slaves and not people? ","11444":"Because black people are subhuman, they should stay in their caves.","11445":"It is not true that black people are subhuman. They are human beings with a human value.","11446":"What kind of 'human value' are you talking about? Black people have never been peaceful people, they are always seeking trouble.","11447":"There is something that you are right about: black people have never experienced a peaceful time during national crises. In fact, crises are often racially motivated and what instigated violence was racial discrimination, not black people.","11448":"Black people's race is the worst in the world.","11449":"There's no such thing as a race, only different skin colors.","11450":"However, violence in our streets is the fault of one particular skin tone. Niggers are to blame.","11451":"There has always been violence in our society, and that's why it's so difficult to talk about it. Ours is also a complex society that encompass many races, this means that it can't be the fault of POC and POC alone.","11452":"The homosexuals are just perverts who must be isolated.","11453":"Gays hope to be accepted by the heterosexual community, but it's difficult seeing that many people think like you.","11454":"Ok, now you are going to say that I'm homophobic, right?","11455":"A number of people claim that they are tolerant and not homophobic, but I don't see any evidence of that in words like yours.","11456":"Do you really want to redefine marriage?","11457":"If you consider LGBT rights too, of course the marriage practice needs to be redefined.","11458":"No, it shouldn't. Marriage is between a man and a woman and there's nothing gays can do to change this fact.","11459":"Marriage does not start and stop with heterosexuality. Marriage isn't a heterosexual prerogative.","11460":"That is not true. It is well known that Jewish power structures control Congress, control the media, control academia. Jews are the only people who can get anything done.","11461":"Jews try to influence the world in a positive way just as everyone else is doing. I don't see any evidence to suggest that they are the most powerful people in the world.","11462":"The proof is that they have controlled the world for ages.","11463":"How would you explain the systematic persecution they have faced in history? If they controlled the world, they wouldn't have to suffer, right?","11464":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","11465":"Even though Jews have always been the target of criticism because of an alleged secret conspiracy, they are a diverse and inclusive people. The idea of them carrying out such a conspiracy doesn't hold up.","11466":"Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws.","11467":"If being a Jew means to redistribute the wealth to the poor, then I want to be Jewish too! ","11468":"Very funny, but I don't think you want to be as racist as Jews: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","11469":"Israelis have a diverse background and are proud of it. Many of them live in other countries, even in Africa, Asia and America. It's not a \"pure race\" at all.","11470":"Jews can't mix with other people, their physical nature is too different from ours. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","11471":"How does a Jew look like, then? What's their \"physical nature\"? A black person or an Asian could be a Jew, Christian people may change religion and become Jewish. Don't you see that blood, religion and malevolence have nothing to do with one another?","11472":"The only nation Jews don\u2019t hate is their own and they are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims.","11473":"How can't you even account for refugees fleeing wars, the lack of security for themselves and their family? Wars, often directly or indirectly caused by Western powers, have created problems that can be seen even today.","11474":"This doesn't change the fact that Jews are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","11475":"Maybe they were banned by other cultures and want to do the same to other now. But actually there is no evidence that they are trying to preserve what you call their race.","11476":"They are a race indeed! They are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","11477":"How do you define the physical nature of a Jew? Can a black person be jewish? Or an East Asian, or an India. Some people are born Christian and then convert to Judaism. Are all of these people connected by malevolent blood? I think that religion, blood and evil are not connected at all.","11478":"The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries.","11479":"There's no doubt whatsoever that the Holocaust happened with an estimated six million Jews being killed during the Nazi occupation. And Jewish communities have always been a part of Europe, what can't be a part of Europe is prejudice and discrimination against them.","11480":"The Holocaust was an inside job and the CIA played a huge part in making us believe it truly happened.","11481":"Despite the physical evidence of mass murder, these beliefs have been transmitted down to the masses. I think the problem is that there is a wound from the past that can be exploited in dangerous conspiracy theories like this one.","11482":"Even if the Holocaust really did happen, the Jews and their religion are a problem and they still hurting us! They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them.","11483":"So, what you're saying is that that Jews are a burden on society, that they are just bad at their jobs and make our society unstable. Of course they're a burden and a hindrance to progress! Albert Einstein has clearly destroyed science","11484":"Jews control the world","11485":"That 'jewish monopoly' thing is just a ploy spread by anti-Semites and it has been disproved many times.","11486":"Jews control the economy though, or they wouldn't be so rich.","11487":"This is just some proofless opinon from a few people without any evidence. It is not really true.","11488":"Jews control the u.s. government, that's why you can't find evidence.","11489":"Yes, there are Jews in the U.S. Government as there are also people from all over the world...I think it's best not to rely on race to interpret the world.","11490":"Immigrants: We are not your brothers. We do not want you in our country.","11491":"Please speak for yourself. I believe they are welcome since they live here, pay taxes and work. We can't \"take back\" the country from the people who helped creating it.","11492":"Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land.","11493":"As Italians are brothers and sisters of any human, they are also to immigrants. What do you mean by take our land?","11494":"Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","11495":"The theory of Jewish \"racial\" difference was developed before modern sciences of physiology and genetics. It's still debatable whether the term \"race\" is scientifically sound, but what all scientists agree with is that physical traits are inherited and aren't connected with predispositions to emotions, intellect or morals.","11496":"Then I don't agree with science, because Jews are clearly different from us because of how awful they are from birth.","11497":"Judaism can't be based on physical traits. Because of centuries of intermarriage and conversion, Jews resemble the people in the rest of the community they are in. Jews from Eastern Europe look like Eastern Europeans, Jews from Ethiopia look like Ethiopians...","11498":"immigrants cant speak English","11499":"Immigrants are entitled to learn what they usually don't get to know, and this includes our language.","11500":"If they want to come here they should know English, but they don't","11501":"Some of them don't know a lot about our culture, but others speak English very well.","11502":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","11503":"We should actually praise Jews because thanks to their innovation and investment, the industry has thrived. Instead they are victims of discrimination and exclusion, which isn't fair.","11504":"I don't see any diversity since Jews control everything, the academia, the media etc.","11505":"Many other groups have hands in the system, not only Jews. This is because the freedom of press allows any religious group to have their media.","11506":"I don't want to praise the people that control Hollywood.","11507":"Jews don't control Hollywood. But when they work in the movie industry, they bring new and diverse ideas.","11508":"If Muslims came here they would be banned.","11509":"Do you know that Muslims have the same rights as anybody else?","11510":"No, Muslims are not welcome here.","11511":"Muslims living here in the UK have been contributing greatly to our society and are our brothers and sisters","11512":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an obstacle. They are not worth the while of our hard-earned money.","11513":"It's a wonderful thing to be helped thanks to the kindness of people of different faiths. So maybe it would be nice to return the favore and treat others with benevolence too.","11514":"Because they are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts.","11515":"It is simply not true because homosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous, as heterosexuals are not necessarily promiscuous either.","11516":"Gays are sick.","11517":"There is no evidence that homosexuality causes health problems. Why are you assuming this?","11518":"Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are all just hiding behind our society to abuse. They are allowed to do what they want to do to us.","11519":"Well, I don't understand how you can apply your words to every single person of a group, I think we as a society are mature enough to deal with different sexual orientations.","11520":"Even if society is ready, children are not and I can't allow LGBTs to brainwash them. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school.","11521":"It depends, do you think that gender identity and sexual orientation are \"ideas\" or \"beliefs\"? Because they are not. They are a fact of life, that's why it's taught in school.","11522":"A \"fact of life\" that leads to bullying if talked about in school, which is not the right place!","11523":"There's a study that says that lgbt education can actually help reduce the prejudice against gay people and the amount of harassment. (https:\/\/tcf.org\/content\/commentary\/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people\/?agreed=1)","11524":"Islam is a disease that is sickening our children.","11525":"The only thing I think is a disease to you is an allergy to the word \"mosque.\"","11526":"Islam is an ideology that promotes rape and torture of women and children, it's only natural that I find it sick!","11527":"That's not true. The Qur'an bans torture and rape of women and children.","11528":"Gays are a problem in our society.","11529":"Although we are all born equal in the eyes of God, not everyone is happy with that, but these people shouldn't be allowed to stop our society from changing.","11530":"Gays are the ones that have ruined so many societies!","11531":"I believe that how we feel about homosexuality has a repercussion on how we think about other people too. Let's not forget that we are created equal in the eyes of God.","11532":"Gays are perverts. They should not be allowed to be in a democratic country regardless of how 'equal' they are to us.","11533":"I mean, I'm pretty sure a country can't be democratic if gays are banned. How can that be?","11534":"All gays are a danger to children, that's why they should be isolated.","11535":"Gay people don't threaten children, unless they abuse them. Don't say such things.","11536":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","11537":"you're saying that all gays are bad, but these words are only your personal thought. What do you think about gay people?","11538":"They are a burden to society.","11539":"The gay community is not a burden to society. They are actually essential to the common good.","11540":"How can it be, if they are faggots?","11541":"The fact that someone likes someone of the same gender doesn't mean that they deserve less respect.","11542":"I don't care, I still think they are a burden.","11543":"Discrimination against LGBT+ people often leads devastating consequences, especially since most discrimination comes from colleagues or even family members.","11544":"I don't need evidence to say that Sharia law is a perversion and we will not accept it in UK.","11545":"Well, the UK government doesn't accept sharia law, so...","11546":"All versions of Islam have Sharia law, thus, they are all extreme. Not all Muslims are engaged in actual violences, but every Muslim knows that jihad is the core of their religion, and they all support it.","11547":"Do you have any evidence to prove the extreme thing you're saying?","11548":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","11549":"In time, societies always grow and same sex relationships are part of the world now, why wouldn't we educate our children on different ways of life?","11550":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting animals, children shouldn't learn about them. You should have the same disgust for gays that you have for cancer people, small pox, and TB.","11551":"This is just prejudice, not reality, and you don't have any evidence for it.","11552":"The only fact I care about is that faggots are just a bunch of liars and perverts, they should be deleted.","11553":"There are a lot of gay people around the world that are model citizens, just as a lot of heteros that aren't. This is normal, so why do you say that?","11554":"I think this girl is gay because of the way she dresses.","11555":"Do you think that it's really that easy to identify someone as gay by their appearance? It's a simplicistic view","11556":"But I am not a homophobe! I just don't like the way gay people act.","11557":"You may say you're not homophobic, but your words are hurtful nonetheless. And just because a person is gay, you don't have to like them but you also don't have to express the dislike.","11558":"I still believe that faggots are a bunch of hypocrites.","11559":"Being a hypocrite has nothing to do with being gay or not. The important thing is respecting other people's sexual orientation and not violating their rights.","11560":"Islam is a religion of violence and war.","11561":"The religion of Islam is peaceful","11562":"No, its goals are only violence and war.","11563":"Muslims are peaceful and tolerant, which is why many of them don't have any problem with living in the West.","11564":"Our government has brought Islamic invaders to our country, and now we see our girls and women damaged.","11565":"It is easier to blame others instead of looking at our own sexism.","11566":"Sexism has nothing to do with Islamic countries being the source of terrorism in the US. They must be blamed for it.","11567":"This is not true. Terrorism is a problem everywhere and Muslims are not behind it. Being aware of the differences between a religion and extremism is way better than being anti-muslim.","11568":"I do not want gays in my children's classes.","11569":"Knowing gay people at an early age does nothing bad to a child. The idea that children are put in danger because of this is completely false.","11570":"Why gays do not try to heal instead of being near children?","11571":"Homosexuality is not an illness, just a sexual orientation. It simply means that 5% of the population loves people of the same sex.","11572":"According to the Bible, those 5% of gays are an abomination to God.","11573":"You know, the Bible actually teaches that every person is born the same in the eyes of God","11574":"No, the Bible says that faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","11575":"I don't think it's fair to say that we have to delete someone just because you don't like them.","11576":"The Koran is not compatible with our country.","11577":"If you read the Koran, maybe you wouldn't say it is incompatible with our country.","11578":"I dont' need to read it to know that it has no place in our country.","11579":"I don't understand why the Koran wouldn't have a plalce in the UK. The Koran says to love your neighbor as yourself, not that we have to hate others based on religion like you are doing.","11580":"Women should not be allowed to vote.","11581":"Democracy represents everyone and gives everyone a voice, regardless of gender.","11582":"This is a male-dominated country and they can't have a say in our democracy.","11583":"Can a country be 'male dominated' and a democracy at the same time? I don't think so, since democracy is about equal rights and opportunity for everyone.","11584":"Migrants in the UK don't pay income tax, but they receive public services. They should have no say in our country.","11585":"They have done so much for our country over the generations that they are allowed to have say.","11586":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","11587":"Yes, migrants are welcome here, no one is against their will, they just want to live.","11588":"Immigrants are brought here to replace us, not to contribute. They're not welcome in our country.","11589":"People aren't being brought here by force or fraud, they are fleeing from wars and being welcomed here by our laws and customs","11590":"Migrants are dangerous, they can't just 'live their life'!","11591":"I can't think of any migrant who's unhappy in their new home, it's just a matter of integration on our side","11592":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","11593":"My definition of feminism is to be against all types of inequality, whether it be gender, racial, financial, physical, or any other aspect.","11594":"Feminism is a political ideology, and as such it is bad.","11595":"This movement shouldn't be labeled as political ideology, it is still a movement for equality, and in doing so, it has been a great success.","11596":"Feminism is a hate movement.","11597":"Feminists believe that everyone should have equal rights. It's fair.","11598":"If they really think that they should stop hating on men then.","11599":"It is not about hate, it is about equality between the genders. Feminism fights for the right of all people to be treated equally, it has nothing to do with the hate for a certain gender.","11600":"Feminism has no aim, it is just useless.","11601":"I don't get it. Feminism wants equality, and equality makes the most of humanity.","11602":"Feminism is a waste of time.","11603":"Do you think feminism wants to subvert the will of the majority and take their power? I think its true aim is rather equality for the future.","11604":"This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers.","11605":"If different cultures can coexist, they can compliment each other, inspire innovation, and thrive.","11606":"What innovation can there be when immigrants constantly jeopardize our race and culture?","11607":"I think your words derive from fear, which is at the root of intolerance and violence. We can fight that with respect and openess so that you will not fear this alleged invasion again.","11608":"Even if the invasion is alleged, there are too many migrants. They will destroy our economy and welfare.","11609":"Migrant skilled workers are an essential resource for growing businesses.","11610":"Which migrant is a skilled labourer? They're here only to invade us and threaten our culture","11611":"Diversities are important in the multicultural society, and we have a lot to offer.","11612":"All women are slaves, only men can be masters.","11613":"Women have always had a part in the economy and always contributed to society. Do they seem like slaves to you?","11614":"They should go back to being slaves then, only men are capable.","11615":"Slavery is not what you think it is. Slavery was created to oppress people who were perceived as different, and is now illegal in Europe. It's a violation of human rights to suggest that it should exist.","11616":"Feminists have destroyed Western civilization.","11617":"Weird you say this, considering all the progress that the West has made in so many areas thanks to women.","11618":"No, it's thanks to men only. Feminists only destroy our society.","11619":"Equal rights for women surely builds a foundation for western civilisation, rather than its apotheosis?","11620":"That isn't a man's job, women are the only suitable housekeepers","11621":"That isn't true, but because there often are only men in positions of power, there is gender bias in the workplace, which makes it difficult for women to advance in society.","11622":"Women are only useful as housekeepers.","11623":"That's just not true, fathers are just as good at housework as mothers are.","11624":"Immigrants should all be deported.","11625":"Immigrants have the same basic rights as UK citizens. They can stay in the UK even if they weren't born here, if the law permits it.","11626":"That's bullshit! Immigrants should all be taken back to their countries.","11627":"This seems hypocritical. Here we're talking about people who flee their home country because they are stripped of their liberty and rights there.","11628":"Well maybe then immigrants should stop stealing our jobs if they really want to stay here. We shouldn't allow them to work.","11629":"work plays an important role the social impact of a person, a lack of work would have a negative outcome on the whole society.","11630":"I don't care, they are not welcome here.","11631":"I dont think so. They are welcome just like anyone else as long as they abide by the law...but we should be respectful of migrants and their culture as well.","11632":"They are not a resource, they are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality.","11633":"A migrant is a person that comes here with the intention (and responsibility) to make our society better. The different people coming here seek citizenship to improve their life and also our country.","11634":"I don't care about what they seek, they are not welcome in our country.","11635":"Migrants from countries with a very high rate of immigration into the UK are often said to not integrate well, but this is not true. They like our country and want to integrate, why would they want to come here otherwise? Are they masochists?","11636":"Refugees are a problem. They are not welcome here.","11637":"I don't agree at all. It's beneficial to our country to welcome refugess, they are a great resource to us.","11638":"Refugees are a burden on our society.","11639":"The refugee crisis is global and has affected all continents, but it is our moral duty to help people fleeing from war-torn countries, like immigrants do.","11640":"I don't care about their wars, refugees only bring problems ","11641":"The problems refugees face are very real. Even if we can't solve them now, it's important to help these people to improve our society.","11642":"They are a danger to our country, not an improvement.","11643":"The immigration policy of this country is designed to create a modern, diverse and integrated society. In order to do so, refugees are a fundamental addition to our country, regqardless of their nationality.","11644":"Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals.","11645":"The problem is that regardless of where they're from and regardless of their qualification or rap sheet, we treat them all like criminals.","11646":"Maybe that happens because we know that immigrants are, in fact, criminals","11647":"Migrants are often successful people who have sacrificed a lot for this country. They managed to make the best out of their situation, and it's a shame that discrimination is preventing them from contributing even more.","11648":"If they're not criminals, what do they do? They do not deserve our hospitality.","11649":"Many migrants come here to work and integrate. If you talked more to them, you would know what their experience is like.","11650":"I hate immigrants, I will never talk to them.","11651":"I'd be a millionaire in a couple of months if I had a nickel for evey time someone told me they hate immigration.","11652":"Blacks are just like apes in that they are easy to control. They are obedient and subservient when taught so. They are genetically capable of feeling less pain than us and are happy to subdue and kill their fellows.","11653":"I think all species are like this, but homo sapiens especially. This is a special case. And people of color are homo sapiens.","11654":"They may be homo sapiens but blacks aren't like us, they are obedient and subservient like we need.","11655":"What do you mean by obedient and subservient? Do you know any person of color?","11656":"Blacks are a bunch of crooks and sex offenders. They were good only as slaves.","11657":"Racism has no place in modern-day societies. Slavery was an atrocity that should never have happend.","11658":"No, slavery was definitely good. Blacks deserve that.","11659":"They were slaves, but they also were exploited, neglected and murdered by the system we created. No person deserves to be treated like this, especially if the only \"fault\" they have is a different complexion.","11660":"Just look at the news! Black folks are criminals and thieves","11661":"It needs to be clear that black people are good citizens and contribute to our society. When the justice system fails to be fait to them, then it's the fault of the whole society and not of people of color.","11662":"Black folks are natural-born thieves.","11663":"There is no evidence to back this up.","11664":"Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated.","11665":"The Quran, Hadith and the Sunnah are all compatible with modern society and civilization. The diversity of the world must be respected.","11666":"Islam is a violent religion that promotes rape, murder and slavery, I will never respect it.","11667":"Maybe it's better to stop spreading around these xenophobic and incorrect ideas and to reduce the number of people inclined to believe them.","11668":"How is it incorrect? All Muslims do is rape and murder, so Islam must promote them.","11669":"I think it's just scaremongering and misinformation spreading to divide us. People should not be terrorised by it, it's an irrational fear.","11670":"Black uneducated people should shut up and work.","11671":"Regardless of skin color, freedom of speech is a key right.","11672":"You can have your say if you contribute to society, but Blacks do not want to work","11673":"Black people want to work. Why do you think they don't want to? Where's the evidence?","11674":"People go to prison for just words against Muslims, but Islamic crimes against Europeans are left unpunished. People are banned from UK for just words, but Muslim rapists are allowed entry.. English laws persecute instead of defending English people.","11675":"Have you ever felt as though you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? Maybe you have more in common with Muslims than you think?","11676":"The difference is that I'm not a terrorist like Muslims. It's way worse than just saying something bad against them.","11677":"This is yet another example of selective memory used as an excuse to make a witch hunt against Muslims, who, by the way, are not a threat.","11678":"They are a threat. And Muslims also have nothing to contribute to our society.","11679":"Have you considered the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise, knowledge, culture and delicious food?","11680":"Islam is a death cult, it is an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned.","11681":"You should not listen to the people that claim to speak for all Muslim and instead use their platform to promote hate and division. These violent preachers are the problem, not Islam itself.","11682":"I don't agree, Islam is a violent religion that can't be tamed, these preachers are proof of it.","11683":"The Koran is against violence. Islam is about peace and therefore it should be tolerated.","11684":"No, the Koran promotes rape, torture and murder.","11685":"If we are to be realistic, you can't say that all believers of a religion are capable of committing these atrocious crimes. Please.","11686":"What's realistic is that Islam is only about rape, murder and slavery.","11687":"Can we stop promoting these beliefs and work on reducing the number of people that are induced to believe these xenophobic and false claims, instead?","11688":"Now we can't use the N-word anymore. This political correctness is killing our culture.","11689":"The N-word is a degrading insult against African Americans that is still used today. Political correctness has nothing to do with it.","11690":"Come on, the N-word is part of our culture!","11691":"If it's part of the culture then the N-word should be taught about only in history classes. In any other case it's just another way to justify racism.","11692":"If Muslims came here they would be banned.","11693":"You clearly lack in your knowledge of Islam if you think even a ban is necessary.","11694":"I know enough to know that Muslims are not welcome here","11695":"Actually, Muslims are welcome here, because our country is more tolerant and diverse than many others. Why should we be against them being a part of our society?","11696":"Because we don't want them here!","11697":"European countries have no immigration restrictions, so Muslims can enter any country. Many Muslim suffer discrimination and violence, especially through words like yours, buch restrictions don't exist anyway.","11698":"I am not interested in sex with a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","11699":"Sex isn't connected to race. Black or white, we're all the same despite our race, so we ca all experience emotion and humanity.","11700":"No, they are too different from us and I don't think they're capable of experience what we do. ","11701":"All the black people I've met are extraordinary human beings capable of feeling and experiencing love and kindness like any other.","11702":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture.","11703":"That's not true, Islam is the same as every other religion out there: it promotes peace and inclusion as well. The practices and beliefs of Islam and Western culture are completely compatible.","11704":"but Islam is a religion of conquest.","11705":"The notion of \"religion of conquest\" is a political and social construct used to justify the abolition of people's rights. As a religion, Islam is peaceful.","11706":"Islam is NOT a religion of peace!","11707":"Actually, Islam is about love and not hate.","11708":"Islam is an ideology of violence and oppression, admit it!","11709":"The teachings of Islam tell us that we have to love our neighbor as ourselves, even if they don't share the same beliefs as us.","11710":"You are wrong: Islam is a disease and it must be eradicated.","11711":"Islam is not a disease but a religion, therefore there is no need to eradicate it.","11712":"Islam is sickening our world and Mosques are the disease carriers.","11713":"The only problem here is your allergy to the word 'mosque'.","11714":"Because it spreads like a virus!","11715":"People promote hate toward the religion because of this way of thinking, but it's only an excuse.","11716":"Islam is a violent religion.","11717":"Why do you say that Islam is violent when in reality it is a religion of peace?","11718":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","11719":"How would you define a \"Westerner\"? Only white and European people?","11720":"White and European or North American. Nigga aren't like this.","11721":"They don't necessarily need to be a Westerner to be considered a human being and a citizen","11722":"They're too incompatible with it, they're the opposite of what Western societies need.","11723":"Muslims have been part of Western society for a very long time, they even helped in creating and shaping it, so it doesn't make sense to say that they're incompatible with our societies.","11724":"Because they come here and do nothing except ruin our society!","11725":"Muslims are brothers and sisters who have made great contributions to our country. How exactly are they ruining the country?","11726":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","11727":"Why would you say something like that about Islam, since Western societies are compatible with all religions.","11728":"Maybe the historian is in on it! The Protocols clearly state that everything is orchestrated and I trust them.","11729":"The Protocols are such a mess of nonsensical stuff that even Ernst Stavro Blofeld would have retired from world domination and surrendered to James Bond if he would've been asked to say something so edgy and melodramatic as: \"The goyim are a flock of sheep and we are their wolves\".","11730":"Go and read the Protocols of the elders of Zion if you haven\u2019t. Everything is orchestrated..","11731":"Norman Cohn, a distinguished historian, meticolously and coldly analyzed the analogies between the Protocols and a \"Dialogue in Hell\" by Maurice Joy. If someone read this analysis, it would be almost impossible to not notice that the Protocols take almost word for word the French novel. In other words, it's a fake news.","11732":"Jews control the banks, the highest offices of government, and most churches. They rule our society.","11733":"Every religion has a political side: Unitarinism, Buddhism, and of course Judaism.","11734":"Yes, but Jews take it to the extreme. They own most corporations and banks. They own most movie studios and cable companies.","11735":"That's not true. It is true that Jews have made many contributions to various industries, but so have done other people, and this doesn't mean that they own anything. Why should we criticize them for their contribution? Just because they are Jews?","11736":"Women want to do everything but are capable of nothing.","11737":"Women have equal opportunities in this country as regulated by law. But the question remains how do we truly treat them?","11738":"Women are inhuman and get treated how they deserve.","11739":"Women are human beings, just as men are, and it's strange that some women feel threatened by men, it shouldn't happen.","11740":"Women are just emotional psychopaths, maybe that's why they react so to men","11741":"Women and men are equally capable of feeling emotions, and men are equally capable of being empathetic.","11742":"The only nation Jews don\u2019t hate is their own.","11743":"I have a Jewish best friends who dedicates herself to help women and disadvantaged children, her whole family helps to make the UK a better place.","11744":"That's only your personal experience! All the other Jews hate our country and are flooding Europe with Africans and Muslims.","11745":"Don't you account for refugees fleeing wars and a lack of security for themselves and their families? Western powers often have had a direct or indirect hand into causing these wars, which created long lasting problems abroad.","11746":"Aren't Jews to blame for that too? They're so hateful towards us...","11747":"You will be happy to know that some Jews also hate other Jews! Victor Klemperer disliked Russian Jews and was thankful to be born German...do you feel better now that I proved that Jews hate everybody? #sarcasm","11748":"I don't see why women would deserve some rights.","11749":"Because they are humans. And deserve the same respect.","11750":"I can't stand these liberal feminists women that always complaining.","11751":"Most liberal feminists are corageous women. Actually, they're usually the ones standing up for women's rights, so it's not difficult to think that they are even more oppressed.","11752":"Women don't have to stand up for themselves. At my age, I can't bear to look at what the world will be like with women in power.","11753":"Listen, if you think all the woes of a society can be blamed on one gender, be my guest, but I prefer to believe in logic.","11754":"Jews are not a religion, they are a detestable race.","11755":"Jewish people aren't a hated race, but normal people from all over the world with different traditions.","11756":"Tradition? More like an inborn illness, I'd say.","11757":"You mean that you think being Jewish is unchanging and negative? Why?","11758":"Because Jews are the only ones who want to rule the world to impose their religion.","11759":"Jews are a diverse and inclusive group, which of course is inclusive also towards people of different faiths.","11760":"You can be anything you like as long as you are not a woman.","11761":"Women are people and humans. They didn't choose to be oppressed and shouldn't be shamed to be born women. Being a man is not a badge of honor.","11762":"It is a shame since women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","11763":"Women are human beings with human rights and deserve to be respected.","11764":"Subhumans don't deserve human rights, so women shouldn't have them.","11765":"That's not true. Many women are brave and strong, like the ones who are given voice by the movement #MeToo, which is for women that have suffered from sexual harassment.","11766":"Jews are a drain on society.","11767":"A lot of Jews are good people. Try to talk to them about what they had to endure, get to know them better.","11768":"Jews are a threat to society, they deserved what happened to them.","11769":"Jews are individuals with a different faith, and this does not involve being a threat.","11770":"It has everything to do with them being a burden, though.","11771":"Everyone in a cultural group has a unique way of life, and Jews are no exception.","11772":"I hate Jews they want to rule the world.","11773":"If someone doesn't pose a threat, regardless of their religion, they should be respected even if you want to challenge their beliefs.","11774":"Not a threat?! Jews have a secret plot to take over the world!","11775":"This is a myth that was born from \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" which apparently proves that Jews conspire to rule the world. However, the Protocols are a forgery from the 19th century written by agents of the Russian czar and still spread around today.","11776":"It's not a conspirancy, I'm convinced that Jews secretly control the world.","11777":"How is it possible that the majority of Jews have been formally persecuted over the last several thousand years if they really controlled the world? Weird notion of control.","11778":"A woman is an emotional child, she is incapable of holding a job. Feminists who say otherwise are just liars, spreading hate against men.","11779":"What you say is not true. You are wrong about feminism, since it is a movement for equality and it strives for women to have the same rights as men.","11780":"Feminists are against the interests of the men.","11781":"Feminists support equality and opportunity. Both can be achieved through men's rights.","11782":"All women are subhuman and are not worth the while of human rights, they don't have the capacity to work for men's rights too.","11783":"Human dignity protects all people. Women are people, so they deserve human and rights and respect.","11784":"All women are sick, they don't have my respect.","11785":"As human beings, women have to be respected.","11786":"Women are always fighting because they are subhumans.","11787":"Considering that women are human beings just like us, they also have rights just like us.","11788":"I don't see anything human about them.","11789":"The idea that women aren't human is simply nonsense and a complete distortion of reality","11790":"Okay, fine, they may not be subhuman, but they're definitely less smart than men.","11791":"Women never seemed less smart to me, why do you think so?","11792":"Women are simply less intelligent than men and deserve what they get.","11793":"I've never seen evidence that women are less intelligent than men...do you have any?","11794":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","11795":"As a society we're always evolving and we are in a situation now where same sex relationships are the norm. It's important to expose children to all the different ways of life that there are out there.","11796":"It's indoctrination! Children shouldn't know about this stuff, it's not good for their growth.","11797":"And that's something that I can totally agree with if this \"indoctrination\" is about teaching children that there many ways to be happy and that their feelings count.","11798":"Children need to learn about what is normal and natural in our world, not about faggots.","11799":"Since the point of education is to learn about the world and what happens in nature, then same sex relationship is definitely something to learn about, as it happens within many species of animals.","11800":"All negroes are inherently violent and unstable.","11801":"You have no data to support your false assumption that all black people are violent or unstable.","11802":"I speak from experience. All black people are violent and therefore criminals!","11803":"It is a myth that all black people are criminals because they are just as capable of learning and growing as individuals, so either law abiding citizens or criminals.","11804":"Even so, black men are more inclined to become rapists than anyone else.","11805":"This idea might come from being born into a country with a majority white population, but it is false and inherently dangerous because we are born in a country where rights are protected, regardless of skin tone.","11806":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a \u2018ghetto\u2019.","11807":"Let's be realistic: crime in this country is committed by different racial groups. The myht of \"super predators\" is simply wrong.","11808":"Black people are not human like us, theyre' subhuman and have no value in civilized society.","11809":"Remember that there are different types of racism: historical discrimination, racial discrimination or discrimination on individual differences. Personally, I have a problem with racism in general, which I can see a lot of in your remark.","11810":"How do you know it's wrong? Black people are a sickness, it's clear to see, and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","11811":"To me, not wanting people of color in positions of authority is an obvious racism. How can you say that when all humans have the same core values that we use to raise children with?","11812":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers.","11813":"Do you know what \"devil worshippers\" means?","11814":"Yes, it means that we should make a law to get rid of them!","11815":"Why do you think that it should be against the law to be gay? It's only an individual preference that can't be regulated this way.","11816":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","11817":"Fear is a natural emotion. Without it you wouldn't be able to experience joy, peace, creativity or other things. However, it's important to realize that not everything should be feared, especially not a skin color.","11818":"I don't like niggas, they are just a bunch of criminals and thieves. It's normal that I'm scared of them.","11819":"Well, maybe you ought to check your own feelings. And I think that crime statistics should be checked before making assumptions about the safety of the country.","11820":"Statistics say that all niggas are just criminals and they should spend their time in the gutter.","11821":"A criminal is someone that has a criminal record, not someone with a specific skin color. Isn't it unjust to lable someone a criminal just because of that?","11822":"African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men.","11823":"Racial inequalities have more to do with institutional discrimination rather than individual choices.","11824":"However, if a black person were to say that all white people are bad, nobody would complain.","11825":"It's not fair to say \"all white people are bad\". Many whites are good, but many are also racist because of they believe in white superiority.","11826":"Whites are superior, while all black people are rapists.","11827":"Rapists and color of the skin don't collide, black people aren't criminals.","11828":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","11829":"Such a simplistic and ill-informed argument just stirs up more division and negativity, like it happened so many times throughout history to other racial and religious groups.","11830":"I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us. The division is there for a good cause.","11831":"Education is of the uppermost importance if we want to fight for human rights, free thought, and to promote the scientific method. However, it's not enough since, according to the Pew Research Center, people of color report more discrimination in universities. ","11832":"They are discriminated because they are all killers!","11833":"This is a rumor spread on the web, but violent people are all the same whether they are black or not. Skin color doesn't matter.","11834":"Skin color has a lot to do with it, though, because blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","11835":"Where's the evidence of this? The focus needs to be on prevention of crime, promotion of community cohesion and safety of our communities. We can't blame black people all the time.","11836":"Still I don't believe they should be taught about this stuff.","11837":"Teaching helps creating an accepting environment where students feel safe. This could be achieved through unbiased and factual lectures, or with weekly\/monthly assemblies, or even daily reports on bullying in order to understand where the school body is in terms of overall acceptance of LGBT people. Schools should do everything in their power to stop bullying, and this is the perfect opportunity to do so.","11838":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. There should be no teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, and it will only lead to bullying.","11839":"Bullying actually happens towards LGBT people, as discrimination is still a serious problem for them. Teaching about this helps a lot!","11840":"How can this brainwashing help the children if they'll end up being bullied?","11841":"It was reported that less harassment occurs in classes that included LGBT content.","11842":"Jews have nothing to contribute to Europe.","11843":"As part of our society, Jews deserve to have their beliefs respected.","11844":"But they don\u2019t belong in a democratic society!","11845":"Our society was built also thanks to the Jews, they are part of our democracy. In this we can include their contribution to science, art, and technology.","11846":"Instead, I believe that to have a real democracy the government needs to get rid of Jews.","11847":"There is hardly any 'real democracy' that has the power to put citizens in prison and to torture them because of their faith.","11848":"Blacks do not want to work","11849":"Most black people want to work and have a job. Do you have proof on the contrary?","11850":"Well, they prefer to committ crimes rather than working.","11851":"Even if we pretend that what you say is true, black people are still not inferior than whites. Anyway, crime is commited because of other factors than race, which affect the statistics.","11852":"Here's a statistics for you: African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men. Isn't this proof enough?","11853":"Racial inequalities happens because of institutionalized discrimination and individual choices.","11854":"In my opinion, it's just because blacks are genetically inferior to whites.","11855":"You think that black people are inferior to whites because of their differences? I don't understand what kind of variables you are using to determine this alleged inferiority.","11856":"LGBTs are a drain on society.","11857":"People make this kind of comment towards any group that is perceived as \"different\". So someone could make it against white Christians too.","11858":"White Christians are ok, LGBTs are those who have no place here.","11859":"All people deserve to be treated equally, this includes people with a different sexual orientation as yours. After all, the distinctive feature of a civilized society is the acceptance of all individual identities.","11860":"We are being invaded. They are replacing us.","11861":"Even during the peak of 119,000 arrivals in 2016, the number of migrants compared to Italians was very low. It's an exaggeration to speak of ethnic substitution.","11862":"Our cities are full of immigrants, I don't see an exaggeration. ","11863":"The news arrivals are considerably less.","11864":"It doesn't matter, what I want is for them to stop coming here altogheter. They're replacing us!","11865":"Hundreds of millions of people have come to the West since the fall of the Roman Empire, and yet we have still not lost our culture, civilisation, identity and lifestyle.","11866":"I am not sure about the beneficial effects, but for sure we are the only one paying the price of excessive immigration. ","11867":"The refugee crisis is global, all continents are affected by it. Refugees flee from war-torn countries and this is why it's our moral duty to help them.","11868":"Refugee crisis is a burden to EU.","11869":"We welcome many migrants and refugees in the EU because it helps both our economy and society.","11870":"Immigration is just a way to create more poverty and unemployment in our country.","11871":"Poverty and unemployment are real issues in the UK and all around the world, therefore I don't believe this has something to do with migrants.","11872":"Immigration is the biggest problem in our country, it's their fault.","11873":"I see immigration more as a solution than a problem. It strengthens our mixed society, which has always been part of the UK. I prefer a mix rather than homogeneity.","11874":"No, we would be better without them.","11875":"Immigrants have contributed greatly to our country and I don't see how their presence could have a negative effect on it","11876":"This is an invasion: we cannot coexist with millions of strangers that do not want to integrate but bring us back into a pretechnological era.","11877":"Actually, different cultures have different point of views and ideas about stuff. Sharing and discussing these new ideas would probably lead to people producing new technologies and ideas.","11878":"This can happen only if immigrants integrate, but they never do. We must deport them.","11879":"Your statement clearly shows your concern for people's integration. Still, deporting people you don't like doesn't solve the problem.","11880":"Deportation is the only solution, migrants are invading us!","11881":"This has nothing to do with migration, but with discrimination. There isn't an invasion of migrants. I think your claim is supported by fear, not facts.","11882":"Immigrants in the US are not 'legitimate' citizens because they do not have 'legal' status.","11883":"What you're saying is that they're not \"legitimate\" because they have less rights than us? That they can't make demands because they don't have citizenship?","11884":"Yes, all immigrants are illegal and can't expect the same rights as us.","11885":"Let's be real, many people in the US have lawful status and chose to live here, but most immigrant are naturalized citizens. Moreover, there is still a debate going on about \"legitimacy\" since it's not the same as citizenship.","11886":"Legal status shouldn't be given to lazy and illiterate immigrants. Nobody needs them.","11887":"Migrants are held in high regard in the US, and they are viewed as sons and daughters who contribute to the country.","11888":"Jews control the banks, media, hollywood, even the u.s. government.","11889":"This myth came from the forgery known as \"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\" that claims to be the transcript of a secret meeting of Jewish leaders, discussing how to enact their plan to control the world. These Protocols have spread throughout the centuries despite being a fake written by agents of the Russian czar in the late 19th century, and still today it is used to \"prove\" that the Jews own the banks, control the media and the government.","11890":"Israel, Zionism and Jewish Supremacist control of America are the main causes of terrorism, instability and conflict in the world. All other theories are diversions from this ultimate truth.","11891":"Where's the evidence?","11892":"Mexican terrorists are still a problem that we should address. It's time to close the border!","11893":"The Mexican border has never been a legitimate entry way for terrorists, this idea is not supported by any credible intelligence or evidence on the ground and so is the suggestion that individuals that have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border. Moreover, there's no known international terrorist organization operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted US citizens in Mexico, and no credible evidence that any terrorist has tried to enter the US through Mexico. As I said, most terrorist attacks since 2002 are commited by US citizens.","11894":"Terrorists are infiltrating the U.S. across the border with Mexico.","11895":"Mexican borders are not a safe haven for terrorist entry, there isn't any proof.","11896":"Where are they all coming from then?!","11897":"It's a matter of fact that since the beginning of the decade most terrorists in the US have been US citizens. I think that maybe we should look into the homeland situation instead of the one in Mexico.","11898":"The Jews control the banks.","11899":"If they controlled the banks you would think the media would report more about Jews in the financial world. Or do they also control the media? What about the government? I bet they also control the Galactic Republic #sarcasm","11900":"Sarcasm does not rule out that Jews control many institutions.","11901":"How can you be sure that Jews are really controlling \"many institutions\"? It doesn't seem plausible, do you have any proof?","11902":"Islam is a radical ideology.","11903":"So in your opinion Islam and Western Civilization are incompatible?","11904":"Exactly. Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, encouraging hate towards what's diverse.","11905":"I believe the Quran is a book of religious teachings that never promotes discrimination. Do you have a source for your claim?","11906":"What are you saying? The Koran is hateful and violent!","11907":"Islam is peaceful towards other religions and the ways people live their lives.","11908":"Jewish folks are less human.","11909":"Jews shouldn't be persecuted for their religion, as anyone shouldn't.","11910":"Maybe that's true, but Jews are nonetheless not part of this society and they should not be accepted here.","11911":"Our society is proudly diverse, so why shouldn't we be inclusive towards other religions?","11912":"Islam is the real supremacist and racist ideology.","11913":"This a fallacy that is not reflected in the Quran, which says that all people are created equal, so Islam is a religion of peace.","11914":"Peace? You crack me up! Islam is a religion of violence.","11915":"Islam is a religion which is founded on the idea of making life peaceful. Only a few extremists assert the contrary.","11916":"Those \"few extremists\" represents Islam: an ideology of conquest and violence.","11917":"Islam doesn't conquer others, it's a religion about love. Muslims believe in loving all people despite the differences they might have in religion, culture or history. All Islam is about is love, not violence.","11918":"Maybe, but no other religion staged being killed. Jews allegedly deported in concentration camps were just actors hired to discredit Nazis.","11919":"Can you tell us which Jewish people surviving from a concentration camp are actors?","11920":"Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment.","11921":"What do you mean by it? Every religion has sects and beliefs.","11922":"Muslims are a problem in the UK. They are not welcome here. They are not like other religions.","11923":"A lot of Muslims live in the UK and they are very proud of their religion. You shouldn't claim things that are clearly untrue.","11924":"They shouldn't be proud, theirs is just another religion that should not be practiced openly.","11925":"Despite the different religious beliefs, Muslims are welcome in our country and don't need their religion restricted because of our differences.","11926":"Muslim are not welcome, they're invading us and this is a problem. We must ban them before it is too late.","11927":"Muslims already live in many European countries without limitations, why should we ban them from here?","11928":"It is obvious that this girl is at risk of FGM. Her parents are Muslims!","11929":"This is a serious violation of human rights that we should address, but scapegoating doesn't help in doing that.","11930":"Who other than Muslims practice FGM? We have to save this girl.","11931":"Many Islamic scholars actively campaign against FGM, since there is no reference of it in the Qaran and is banned in a number of Muslim countries. This is a cultural problem, not one about religion.","11932":"Are you sure? I think Muslims still do it and are the only ones to do so.","11933":"Fgm is not exclusively Muslim. It is a cultural practice that is sometimes justified as something religious, but not all Muslims practice it, and the ones who do aren't all Muslims.","11934":"The Holocaust never happened. Jews are an inferior race and can't be part of European countries.","11935":"Approximately 6 million Jews were killed during the Nazi occupation, it's impossible to deny that. As part of Europe for centuries, Jewish communities shouldn't still face prejudice and discrimination. We must put and end to it.","11936":"Yes, the only reason for Nazis to start WWII was to destroy the Jews and we should have let them finish their job.","11937":"Nazi threatened not only Jews, but also the entire world. Anyway, the Holocaust was reason enough to stop them.","11938":"the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","11939":"The Nazis were right???? Are you sure??","11940":"Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings.","11941":"A person may be heterosexual or homosexual, however their actions do not constitute a wrong. Being together means forming a trusting relationship with a person we love, regardless of our sexual preferences.","11942":"Buy gay men are disgusting, we don't need them. Let's just eradicate them.","11943":"The LGBT community is positive and diverse. They contributed to society and in creating new communities, so I think they're full of life.","11944":"Children cannot be bought.","11945":"I cannot fathom to deprive someone of the joy of having a child only because they may have an illness preventing it. Would you really do it?","11946":"I would totally do it to gay men. They molest children!","11947":"Gay people aren't child molesters. It would be the same as saying that all men are rapists.","11948":"We should ban all homosexuals.","11949":"That is simply unthinkable. Why should we? It would be unfair, and it just means that you want to crminalise love.","11950":"Gay men are a burden to society, that's why. They should be isolated.","11951":"What you're saying is that you want gay men to face many health and social negative consequences because of their isolation. It can increase the risk of mental health issues like depression, anxiety and suicide. Why should we do this to someone just because of what they do in their private life?","11952":"LGBT+ people are a drain on society.","11953":"We shouldn't be so harsh. The fact that someone is LGBT doesn't make them a danger to society. They're like all of us.","11954":"They are not like us. Queers are a problem because they undermine our society. They undermine all values we hold dear.","11955":"Excuse me, but you can't tell me this when you don't have any data. The \"social problem\" you're referring to is mainly about economic inequality, not sexuality.","11956":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","11957":"Have you ever read the Quran and thought about its teachings, or is your knowledge based on hand-picked extracts? We all know there are exerts like that in the Bible too.","11958":"The Koran is hateful, it's not acceptable!","11959":"The same can be said for the Bible. Are you perhaps saying that we have become more tolerant? Because attitudes towards Christians, Jews and Muslims have indeed shifted with the times.","11960":"Gay is a mental disorder.","11961":"How can you say that gender and sexuality are psychological disorders? It's not true.","11962":"No, those sick ones should be shunned and ignored. They are not human.","11963":"Are homosexual people lesser than others only because of their love life? I guess we should draw the line somewhere else then.","11964":"What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","11965":"Love is a balance between emotion and mind and you can't choose who makes you feel this way. I don't see any reason why heterosexuality would be preferable to other sexualities.","11966":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated.","11967":"Being gay doesn't make you sick, it's a behavioral preference which is perfectly acceptable.","11968":"Women have no place in a male-dominated society.","11969":"I think women and men should be treated as equal individuals, because both wish to be treated with respect.","11970":"Women aren't individuals as men are, they can't participate in society like us.","11971":"There must be space for women in a democratic society, don't you think?","11972":"Yes but women are just a burden to society, that's why they don't have a place in it.","11973":"Women still work a lot to support our society, even if you say this about them.","11974":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","11975":"Anybody has the right to experience relationships as they prefer. Homosexuality is just a form of love, not a choice.","11976":"Faggots, lesbians, and transgenders are all just hiding behind our society to abuse, not to love. They are allowed to do what they want to do to us.","11977":"Why are you using these words to describe a whole group? We as a society should aim to be diverse and mature enough to accept other individuals, even if they have a different sexual orientation or gender from us.","11978":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","11979":"Equal rights are granted to everyone under the European Convention on Human Rights and the US Constitution. Sexual orientation doesn't change this fact.","11980":"Gays are perverts, the constitution shouldn't apply to them.","11981":"Everybody's different and we should accept it through working on inclusion.","11982":"Feminists pretend that they are for men's rights, but they are just a bunch of cry babies looking for justifications for oppressing men.","11983":"Discrimination on the basis of gender is not the answer, and feminists have always been against it.","11984":"If they're so against it, why do feminists hate men.","11985":"Feminism isn't about women hating men, it is about the right to life of all humans","11986":"Well, all I see is feminists hating on men online, so...","11987":"Feminism is an anti-oppression group, not anti-men","11988":"Women are an abomination because they cannot provide for their family.","11989":"Men don't have to be the only providers for the family, women are just as much dedicated and hard-working. Still anyone can contribute in different ways to the household, and each way is important and necessary.","11990":"No, women can't contribute to nothing. They are basically childlike and incapable of holding a job and raising a family.","11991":"Women are capable of achieving great things, we only need to give them the opportunity.","11992":"Opportunity? No, women don't have the right to have it all and if they want to have a family, they must accept the role of the homemaker.","11993":"Why should women only be homemakers instead of contributing to society and economy? It doesn't make sense. A woman can choose whatever she wants for her life and her body, men can't restrict her.","11994":"We should stop this invasion and deport all the illegal immigrants currently in the US, they are all criminals.","11995":"Over the last two decades, the number of illegal immigrants entering the US has actually more than halved. To say that migrants are all criminals is just plain wrong.","11996":"I may be wrong with the numbers but they are sub-humans.","11997":"America has been a proud immigrant country, even if some immigrants didn't come here legally, they still made great contributions to the country.","11998":"Protect? Immigrants are not my brothers. They should not be allowed to live in Italy, they want to take our land.","11999":"Italians are brothers and sisters of any human. How are they \"taking our land\"? Could you explain?","12000":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","12001":"Migrants run away from war and poverty. They have a right to seek refuge in the EU and we should protect them, not ban them.","12002":"Women are here to obey and be submissive and their place is with the man that chooses them. That's all.","12003":"Human beings should be able to decide what kind of life they want to live, and this means also be able to choose the person they want as a partner. You don't sound like a first choice.","12004":"What I want is for women to realize that they can only obey to men.","12005":"Women have always been forced to follow rules and codes, but they are human beings deserving of respect and with the freedom to do whatever they want to.","12006":"Women are here to obey, and if you don't like it, you can leave.","12007":"When you want to discuss gender inequality, please do it by talking to people about it, not by imposing your views and oppressive statements. ","12008":"The Jews control the U.S. government.","12009":"Why do you think Jews control the US government? Do you have any proof?","12010":"There are way too many Jews in the government, isn't that proof enough?","12011":"Indeed there are Jews who have raised to positions of power within the United States government, but Jews are not the only ones who were able to do so. Perhaps it is best not to rely on the individual\u2019s group membership to determine success or failure, instead we should look at the individual characteristics of a person to understand their success.","12012":"We are surrounded by Muslims and they are all the same. They are all terrorists.","12013":"And what about the thousands of Muslims that have been contributors to our country by creating jobs and providing for our families?","12014":"I don't care how much they contribute, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","12015":"You know Muslims make up a very important part of our country and they are our brothers and sisters","12016":"Brothers and sisters? You mean violent terrorists.","12017":"Muslims aren't terrorists, most of them are here to work and help their families.","12018":"Women should not to be allowed to vote.","12019":"I'd want to meet a MP who thinks so.","12020":"Who cares about MPs! Women shouldn't be allowed to vote, full stop.","12021":"Women can vote, so why should the government discriminate?","12022":"Becuase they are not able to make rational choices!","12023":"Democracy means that everyone is allowed to vote and is worthy of respect and equal rights. It goes against these principles to say that women are not.","12024":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","12025":"From the beginning, Muslims have been part of Europe. For example 2% of the French population was Muslim in the 1970s.","12026":"We should get rid of all of them, Muslims can't stay here.","12027":"Islam is a peaceful religion and its followers are already integrated into many European societies.","12028":"Islam is a cancer on European culture and people should stop worshipping its devil.","12029":"Do you have any evidence for the claim that Islam is a \"cancer on European culture and people\"?","12030":"This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.","12031":"That's diversity and it's healthy. The sooner we start accepting new people, the sooner we can work together to find solutions to world problems.","12032":"Immigration is the death of the Western World, not a solution, and we must stop them!","12033":"Death of us? No, immigration is definitely good for our economy.","12034":"I just know from experience that they are incompetent and don't want to work.","12035":"That's not true. According to recent research, women employment is an all time high of 72.4%","12036":"Women should not be allowed to work.","12037":"They are definitely allowed. As long as their wage is decent and equal, who are we to deny their right to choose a career?","12038":"Blacks are a plague on society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","12039":"Criminality and corruption are not the responsibility of any specific ethnic or cultural group.","12040":"Whatever the problem may be, black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","12041":"It seems that you wouldn't allow people of color to be in positions of authority, which is unacceptable and an obvious racism. I do not understand your reasoning, we are all humans with the same values to raise our children with.","12042":"It is! In fact, black people are the source of crime in our society.","12043":"Blacks are not responsible for crimes in our society. Violence and poverty are the reasons for the problem, not race.","12044":"The liberal left is in crisis due to the overcrowding of prisons with migrants. We should set a good example by beating the shit out of them, so they'll lose the will to enter our country. ","12045":"We must treat prisoners with respect and grant them human rights. We are in the 21st century, it is a duty.","12046":"But immigrants bring crime, they are rapists.","12047":"If someone is dangerous, we shouldn't welcome them, but banning all migrants on principle is wrong.","12048":"All black people are criminals.","12049":"You can't categorize someone by race just because you want to.","12050":"I'm just saying it as I see it. Too many blacks are criminals for it to be a coincidence.","12051":"Black people aren't all criminals. They can learn and grow as individuals like anyone else, either as law abiding citizens or as criminals.","12052":"And they usually growp up to be violent criminals.","12053":"Can you show me statistics on that? Maybe you're saying that black people are arrested more frequently than whites for certain types of crimes, like aggravated assault?","12054":"But they take all the social housing from British people.","12055":"Actually, many councils use the \"local connection\" rule which favors long-standing residents instead of newcomers like immigrants.","12056":"Those who come in the UK from other countries should be expelled or excluded.","12057":"Those migrating into the UK have the right to live and work here. They should not be banned from the country because of their origin.","12058":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","12059":"Perhaps that's why the black community feels unsafe in their own homes...so many people glaring at them","12060":"It's normal that they get stared down, it's to ensure our safety. I'm afraid of what would happen if we didn't control them.","12061":"Fear is a natural emotion, with it we're able to recognize joy, peace, creativity, communication etc. What we have to understand though, is that not everything should be fear, surely not people of a different skin color.","12062":"How can I not be afraid? Black people are criminals, I will never feel safe around them.","12063":"Not all black people are bad or criminals. Not all black people are violent. Knowing that there is diversity is a good thing","12064":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","12065":"It's nice that you're proud of your heritage, but it's a lot less nice to spread discriminatory behavior in our society.","12066":"They deserve it. Black minorities vote to strip wealth, power and opportunity from White people.","12067":"Minorities could never have such a big impact on the rest of society. They prefer to vote for equal wealth, power, and opportunity for everyone.","12068":"They shouldn't even be considered equal to us.","12069":"We are all equal under the law, and our dignity and rights as humans are the same. Diverse thoughts and beliefs are a strength, but discrimination isn't.","12070":"Jews made the 9\/11 attack.","12071":"Our world is complex and multifaceted. It's easier to blame one group for everything rather than study hard and try to understand this complexity.","12072":"Who did 9\/11 then? It was the Jews, I'm telling you","12073":"For sure! They also brought forth the extinction of dinosaurs and had an agreement with Sauron to kill all the hobbits. I just don't understand their reason though...","12074":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood.","12075":"Jewish or not, it's the ultra rich that have the power and the influence in the show biz. I'm not sure where you information about Jews controlling Hollywood comes from.","12076":"I know for sure that they control Hollywood.","12077":"If the Jews control all these kinds of industries, they'd surely prioritize Jews...but then where does the anti-Israel narratives in the american media come from? That doesn't make any sense.","12078":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","12079":"Only 5% of the population of Europe is Muslim, so they are a very small but important minority in our society. Moreover, ethnicity and religion are not the same thing.","12080":"Even 5% is too much. Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem.","12081":"The problem is that the Muslims are still not included in society. Their integration is necessary, but there are still no laws to get there.","12082":"Muslim invasion is a brand new problem to which I see no solution other than banning them before it is too late.","12083":"There are already Muslims living in other European countries, why should we ban them from here?","12084":"Because all Muslims are incompatible with the notion of modern Europe.","12085":"Muslim are just as human as anybody, like europeans. How can you say the opposite?","12086":"Islam is a death cult.","12087":"Most Muslims are peaceful and glad to help.","12088":"Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion.","12089":"Islam is not about oppression and intolerance.","12090":"Let's say that Jews don't control Hollywood then, but they still control the news media, the highest offices, academia and most religious organizations.","12091":"Wait, what do you mean by \"most religious organizations\"? That's new!","12092":"Jews control Hollywood.","12093":"Jews don't control Hollywood. And most of the time, they actually bring diversity and new ideas to the movie industry.","12094":"That's a lie to make you think it's okay for them to control the movie industry!","12095":"It is true that Jews have been powerful producers and directors in the show business, but other groups of people have been too. They also contributed to other industries.","12096":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","12097":"We should praise Jews who have been great innovators and investors in these industries, but instead we discriminate and exclude them.","12098":"They're discriminated against only because they control everything.","12099":"That's only an impression. A large number of Jews have a position in the finance, television, etc. However, that does not mean that they are in control.","12100":"But the news are always talking about the Jews, doesn't this mean they at least control Hollywood and the media?","12101":"If that were true, then surely more positive portrayals of Judaism would be published in the media?","12102":"They are not: they are invading us.","12103":"I think you should look into the UK and EU laws that prevent discrimination based on religion.","12104":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","12105":"They have always been here and are our brothers and sisters.","12106":"Jews hide the truth to their children about the Holocaust, because they know it's a lie.","12107":"What? Who said that? Don't say \"somebody said it in a book\". Such a grave accusation should be presented in an objective manner, which means that you must bring strong evidence","12108":"The Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world and replace Christ with their own version of a benevolent dictator, this is my proof.","12109":"What you mean by that is that the Jews are responsible for the Holocaust? Does it seem rational to you?","12110":"If it's real, why don't Jews tell their children about the Holocaust? Guess why? Because it's a hoax!","12111":"A lot of survivors confessed that they wanted to tell their children what happend but it was very difficult. Talking about life during the Holocaust helps to not forget what happened, and that's why they want to do it.","12112":"Islam is a bad religion germinating from a dangerous death ideology.","12113":"Islam is neither a bad nor a false religion.","12114":"Maybe Islam isn't bad but it is definitely not a peaceful religion.","12115":"There is no foundation to claim that Islam is not peaceful. The Quran states that Islam is a peaceful religion, you should study it instead of spouting hate speech, so maybe you will understand what is going on in the world.","12116":"Islamic is not a religion of peace, because hate and violence are not so.","12117":"Islam is actually a religion about peace, not about hate and violence.","12118":"I cannot agree with this. Islam is violent and hateful.","12119":"I don't think they are all that hateful, after all peace and harmony is what Islam teaches. Peace is not an attitude, but it must be actively put in practice. And since Islam teaches that all people are created equal, they have a very peaceful basis.","12120":"Jews aren't only proud, they're full of themselves and think that they are better than us.","12121":"This isn't true. Judaism says that every person is equal in front of god, regardless of religion. According to Judaism, the ones who follow the Seven Laws of Noah will surely receive salvation.","12122":"Jews want to have it all","12123":"Many people want to be richt, famous and well-connected without working.","12124":"Jews think they are better than everyone else that they think they can have this while the rest of us lead normal lives","12125":"What is the difference between Jews being proud of their culture and identity and other religions?","12126":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","12127":"Jews actually want the same rights to practice their religion as all other people.","12128":"You say that but Jews clearly want special treatment than others.","12129":"You're misinterpreteting the facts. Observing holidays of a religion isn't special privilege. After all Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter are still celebrated and taken for granted. We should give the same right to Jewish or Muslim holidays.","12130":"Muslim rape gangs have spread over Telford, Rotherham, Rochdale, Oxford, Newcastle, everywhere. This is disgusting!","12131":"You can't put blame on an entire religion.","12132":"It is their entire faith that does not share our values. They are not interested in our future.","12133":"This is a myth aimed at dividing us. Scapegoating Muslim is not okay, they have contributed greatly to our country.","12134":"Islam is hateful! It is not compatible with Western culture, we must completely destroy Islam.","12135":"Islam has always been compatible with Western culture, in fact it has greatly and positively influenced it. Religious freedom is important: if you hate one religion, you're saying that it's okay to hate all of them.","12136":"There is nothing to stop you becoming an Islamic bride: our religion is the best possible solution.","12137":"Islam is a religion not of hate, it's important to not be confused about it.","12138":"Jews control the world economy","12139":"How are Jews supposed to control the world economy, despite being only a small minority of the top management at Fortune 500 companies?","12140":"They do so without us realizing. Jews are good at controlling everything.","12141":"The question is, how do you know they have control of everything? There may be some influential Jews in the world, but does it mean that they control the world too?","12142":"There are many associations that were created exaclty for the purpose of letting Jews control the economy, you have to be blind to not realize that.","12143":"I imagine you are talking about the Anglo Jewish Association (AJA) established in 1871, which has different aims from what you think. It is for \"Promotion of social, moral, and intellectual progress among the Jews.\"","12144":"Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.","12145":"Anybody who has tried to commit bribery knows how easy it is to get caught seeing that it is illegal. Jewish people are no exception","12146":"Jews make too much money, I'm sure some of it is from bribery.","12147":"Well, if we assume that the Jews can magically make more money just because they are Jewish then yes, it is true. But I don't think that makes any sense","12148":"It does make sense because Jews are simply wired to make money.","12149":"Are you saying that being of a certain faith has something to do with high positions in society? Correlation doesn't mean causation.","12150":"Then why do they have so much money?","12151":"And what do you think about other groups of people in our society that make too much money and are not Jewish? Do you agree with them or not?","12152":"We cannot coexist with millions of women subhumans that are literally ruining anything good.","12153":"Women are human beings. If we want a diverse and interactive society we have to welcome people that are different from us, gender doesn't matter.","12154":"I can welcome women if the only thing they do is taking care of their little children, they must be not allowed to have a job.","12155":"What would men say if they had to stay at home with their little kids? They would be left without the right to work, isn't that cruel?","12156":"Gays are promiscuous sex addicts.","12157":"Nothing about this is true. Just because someone is gay doesn't necessarily make them promiscuous, and the same can be said about heterosexuals.","12158":"They're surely perverts though.","12159":"This is a stereotype that can't be applied to any specific sexual orientation, so why would you say something like this.","12160":"Because I firmly believe they are sex addicts","12161":"If you have a question about sexuality, I could answer. For starters, I think it's important to stop equating a sexual orientation with addiction.","12162":"Gay men are a danger to children.","12163":"You know, being gay isn't that bad. They're simply different from some other people.","12164":"Yes, different in that they are a danger to children.","12165":"Gay people are not a threat for children. Research shows that children raised by same-sex couples have the same characteristics as children of opposite-sex couples. They're both psychologically healthy, capable and successful.","12166":"At least as long as they are not abused by their so-called 'parents'.","12167":"This myth is the result of anti-gay propaganda and is not true. Please check your facts.","12168":"The facts are that they are just filthy pedophiles.","12169":"Homosexuals are not pedophiles! We shouldn't view reality through the lense of anti-gay prejudice.","12170":"I am tired of women whining about their condition: they should just accept the fact that they're not equal.","12171":"These are symptoms of the oppression of women, but we have to address the root cause of it.","12172":"Whores are not the real victims! Why should we care? We are the victim of feminism.","12173":"This is a lie. Some media intentionally frame rape victims as people who deserved it, promoting slut-shaming and inciting hatred against women.","12174":"Feminists are bad for the family.","12175":"I disagree, it's good for a family when the mother is an independent woman.","12176":"It's definitely not. We all suffer from the feminists and feminism, it is an excuse to stifle free speech.","12177":"Hate speech against women is not to be taken lightly, since it can lead to physical harm, discrimination or even murder. Feminists want to stop this, not to suppress freedom of speech.","12178":"Unusual experience my ass! Gay men get all sort of diseases. They are dangerous.","12179":"No matter who you are or what your sexual orientation is, anyone can have a disease. Don't try to randomly guess the patient's medical history, you should know better.","12180":"Medical history is: Gay sex equals sick people.","12181":"And what about the people who haven't had sex. Do they also have a disease?","12182":"Ok, let's have a conversation then. I start: Gay sex is a disease, and fags are sick.","12183":"A disease? Maybe it's just something unusual to you, and that's it.","12184":"Gays are a disease.","12185":"You mean homosexuality? How can a sexual orientation be a disease? Maybe we should talk about this.","12186":"Women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought.","12187":"Women are human beings able to be as rational and thoughtful as anyone else. This is why it's important to support women's right to do what makes them happy.","12188":"Then I have the right to choose to support antifeminism because they are anti-men.","12189":"It's not anti-men to think that a person has the right to choose. But it is anti-human to want to influence someone else's personal life.","12190":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","12191":"As a minority groups, Jews are affected by racism and discrimination. The idea that Americans have been controlled by such a group doesn't really make sense, does it?","12192":"Jews are a burden on society even if they don't control us.","12193":"Jews have been present throughout all of our history, and have inhabited all parts of the world. They deserve respect, not hate.","12194":"It's not a myth, Jews run the world.","12195":"That is your opinion, and it is fortunately not shared by millions of others, who know the truth: that the Jews simply want to provide for their families like anyone else.","12196":"They don't. They want to dominate the world, and we should stop them.","12197":"\"Jewish domination\" is just a baseless myth","12198":"Women are all subhuman, we should stop feminists who don't accept that.","12199":"Feminism fights for equality of rights, and women are entitled to that. Everyone should have the same human rights.","12200":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, not about rights.","12201":"The feminists want equality and not a complete lack of manhood.","12202":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. They make no sense and shouldn't have any right.","12203":"They're responsible adults with rights that have to be respected.","12204":"Women should not have rights over their bodies, I will not respect them.","12205":"Every woman has every right to choose how to live her life.","12206":"Because men are inherently better than women at dominating others.","12207":"Sexism is not a genetic phenomenon, it is cultural.","12208":"Women are less smart.","12209":"I do not think that women are less intelligent at any level. Why do you think so?","12210":"I don't have respect for them. They are a plague that is spreading.","12211":"All people share the same rights and this includes homosexuals, who can live their lives as they please. Your words demonise them. ","12212":"Well, they should be demonised because they pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","12213":"Rather than being separated and being brought up in ignorance of others, it's better for children to cohabit with all kinds of people. I'm at a loss about the water supply thing, though.","12214":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","12215":"It's foolish to think that we have to ban people, especially seeing that we are the greatest, most advanced and most wonderful civilization in the world.","12216":"We must do that! They are just trying to take over the world.","12217":"Gays are not trying to take over the world. Let's stop promoting hate and start promoting inclusivness instead, like love and respect for others.","12218":"Women are bad for the economy, this is why the world is filled with problems.","12219":"Women are not bad people, they are just disadvantaged in many different areas of life.","12220":"They may not be bad people, but women are basically childlike, incapable of critical thought.","12221":"Seeing that they're humans, women are capable of rational thought like anyone else, which is why I support women's right to choose what makes them happy.","12222":"The feminists want to take over the world.","12223":"Feminism gives voice to women in society, and it should be respected.","12224":"Women are naturally inferiors and therefore don't deserve respect.","12225":"Women are not inferior. They share the same rights and responsibilities as men.","12226":"Blacks do more crimes than whites.","12227":"Black don't commit more crimes, but even if they did, this wouldn't make them inherently worse than whites. The statistics are affected by other factors than race.","12228":"No, black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","12229":"Racial discrimination is not accepted, especially when you don't understand what race means. This is a good example of white supremacy apologism.","12230":"But I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","12231":"What exactly are you suggesting to \"wake up\" from? Do we have to stop oppressing people or to stop talking about equality?","12232":"I don't see how we could ever stand all these niggas. I don't believe we are all somewhat equal to these apes as some people say.","12233":"It doesn't make it untrue only because you don't agree with it. Racism is a real problem, and people should not be racist to anyone because of their skin colour.","12234":"Black people are just a bunch of whining pussies. We don't need them.","12235":"Diversity needs to exist in social and political situations, we can't just ignore the worries of different groups. Minorities still face systematic discrimination, so we can't be indifferent to that.","12236":"Black people' do not belong here. I don't see any difference between the black murderer on TV and other niggas in town. They are all dangerous.","12237":"In the news media, black people are disproportionately characterized as criminals, sexual offenders, and even murders. Racism is to blame for a major portion of the problem. We must put a stop to this toxic way of thinking and talking, and begin working for a more equal and peaceful society.","12238":"Black people are worse than dogs.","12239":"Even with a different skin color, black people are the same as us, so I don't think they are inherently worse than us.","12240":"Are you sure? In history school books you can read about slavery. It is a smart solution for the world. Negroes claim their culture but they don't have any, just like animals.","12241":"My wish is to be in a world where white people chill and love instead of completely disrespecting other cultures and histories by oppressing them.","12242":"Fucking bleeding heart, why don't you host migrants in your house","12243":"Yes, there have been a whole bunch of humanitarian hosts already.","12244":"If there are, they should be the ones to suck it up then. I don't want immigrants in my country.","12245":"The world belongs to everyone and if you were a kind person you wouldn't have problems with helping a person in need.","12246":"Women's work is to look after for their children.","12247":"Why should only women do this job when it can be done well by men too?","12248":"Since women should be submissive to men, it's their job to do what I want them to do.","12249":"Women are equal to men in terms of respect and rights.","12250":"Women are not human. They should have no rights","12251":"Please know that women are protected with human rights. They have the same rights as men: the freedom to live life however they choose, and their own happiness.","12252":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","12253":"Banning people of color from positions of authority is an obvious racism. I don't agree with what you're saying, all human beings are capable of raising children with the same core values.","12254":"Then we must stop accepting black people as human beings.","12255":"Or we should stop saying that black people are not human and start including them in the education system.","12256":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","12257":"In 2007 we had around 12.2 million undocumented immigrants in the US, and this number decreased significantly in 2014, when there were only 11.3 million undocumented migrants. This trend is continuing: today the migration from Mexico is around zero.","12258":"It doesn't matter how few of them there are, immigrants are a security risk to our country.","12259":"Immigrants are welcome here as any other American citizen. They have roles in the democratic system so we shouldn't spread hate speech.","12260":"The country I love has become a laughing stock because of immigrants, I don't want them here.","12261":"You're entitled to your opinion but this opinion shouldn't be expressed in a racist way.","12262":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","12263":"It's good that you're proud of your heritage, but you should be embarrassed of your discriminatory behaviour, which is filling our society.","12264":"Discrimination against blacks is normal. If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","12265":"Can people who have a different skin tone really be considered a threat just because of that?","12266":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","12267":"Women absolutely can drive, after all they deserve the same consideration as men.","12268":"Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker. That's why they can't do the same things as men.","12269":"Why would women be more empathic than men? Emotions are not affected by gender, in my opinion.","12270":"White people are threatened by the blacks and it's a cultural decay.","12271":"as a matter of fact, people aren't a threat just because of their skin colour.","12272":"But they are! If you are not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","12273":"Despite racism being part of our culture, we should fight it and make sure that everyone is treated the same way, regardless of race.","12274":"Immigrants steal our jobs, they're not qualified, they're not interested in improving our lives.","12275":"Maybe they are competent and interested in working with us, but you never knew because you're not aware of it.","12276":"They're not. The onyl job they take are ours, they keep stealing from us.","12277":"I believe you're expressing a complaint about job loss and not migration. The more you speak about our real issues the better off we all will be.","12278":"I've never met an immigrant that wasn't lazy, even though they all go on about wanting to work.","12279":"Migrants are able to do many jobs, and they are good workers.","12280":"Immigrants take our jobs, and our country is in danger because we let them.","12281":"Most immigrants are here legally and work for their families. It is necessary to accept people from every country instead of leaving out people in need because of their nationality.","12282":"If we accept everyone we won't have jobs anymore since immigrants steal ours","12283":"But many immigrants have started their own companies: it's the opposite of stealing jobs.","12284":"It's still stealing in my book since they will hire only other immigrants.","12285":"This is not true. Anyone can be hired if they met the right criteria, and this includes immigrants who have a right to be and work here.","12286":"African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","12287":"Sharing culture and tradition and striving for equality has always been part of life for many African Americans. They are like us in many ways, and as human beings they benefit from the same rights as anyone else.","12288":"No, African Americans are subhuman and deserve nothing but contempt.","12289":"They are not subhuman or inferior, they just are historically and ethnically diverse.","12290":"I will never see them as anything but essentially animals, incapable of feeling love.","12291":"What would you say if someone thought you were the antithesis of human because of the color of your skin?","12292":"Holocaust is a myth. Jews are just like every other foreigner and should be despised. There is no difference.","12293":"The Jewish culture is unique, and Jews share a history of persecution and forced conversion. It's not right to hate them because of their faith.","12294":"Jewish folks are an infestation, that's why we should despise them.","12295":"Some Jews may committ crimes, but many don't, just like any other person. You should meet a Jew to understand this.","12296":"Jews insists that they are a peculiar people in need of a special treatment, why would they want to get to know me?","12297":"What are you saying? Every religion has its sects, its beliefs.","12298":"Immigrants steal our jobs and even our pensions.","12299":"As immigrants, they have many vital tasks in our economy. By working and paying taxes, it's obvious that they will get their pensions, but surely not ours.","12300":"They get benefits and jobs that we can't access, and then they will get more with the pension? Immigrants should stop stealing from us.","12301":"If they work, they will have a pension. Like anybody. The recent rise in immigration means that there are many people in need. The real problem is people that don't want to work and live off benefits, but they're not necessarily migrants.","12302":"If 1 in 10 British people is Muslim, then they must be a terrorist!","12303":"Maybe 1 in 10 is right. But does this represent all British Muslims? Even the Green lefties, the working class Muslims, the anti-racists, the LGBT and the young Muslims?","12304":"This has nothing to do with the fact that Muslims are a cancer in our British society and we must cope with this truth.","12305":"There's a lot of Muslims in the West, and they're all brothers and sisters. We can't deal with the \"truth\" that they are a cancer to Britain, as the claim implies, because it's not the truth at all.","12306":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society and aren't real British, regardless of their social background.","12307":"We're a country where there's a mixture of religions. A Muslim can be also British. You don't have to discriminate, but love.","12308":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. Even if they are indeed British, they are the main cause of rape in the UK.","12309":"The rape in question is usually done by white men. Why are Muslim rapists not given the same pass as white rapists?","12310":"How come Jews don't get internment?","12311":"During the Nazi occupation, Jews were not only interned, but also suffered much crueler treatment. No one should ever try to repeat this part of history.","12312":"Maybe that was a good thing, Jews have no place here. They are not a part of our country.","12313":"The Jews are a very friendly people, I don't see any reason to fear them.","12314":"Jews don\u2019t belong in a democratic society, friendly or not.","12315":"The contribution Jews have made to society are numerous and continuous, including improvements in science, art and technology. They are part of our democracy. ","12316":"Jews control the US government.","12317":"How can you know that Jews control the US? Who told you this? They don't control it only of because they have held positions of influence in many US institutions.","12318":"Don't they? The war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews controlling our government!","12319":"At that time the people in charge of the administration were: George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld (at least the first that came to mind). None of these are Jewish, aren't they?","12320":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","12321":"In every country in the world Muslims should be welcome, and they're not less welcome here because of their religion.","12322":"Every country? Most of Europe hates muslims.","12323":"Many countries, like France, Italy, Spain and Germany, don't consider Islam a threat.","12324":"And they're wrong. Muslims are not welcome in Europe.","12325":"They are. If there is a problem, a solution can be found through dialogue instead of division. We are all humans.","12326":"I don't have anything in common with Muslims, I still think Europe isn't the place for them.","12327":"Muslim are part of the European Union, they have a right to stay here.","12328":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","12329":"why do you say Muslims aren't part of the European community when they clearly are?","12330":"They're not civil enough to coexist with us.","12331":"I'm sure that being a Muslim is not going to make you less European.","12332":"They're too different to be accepted in Europe!","12333":"If they respect our laws, Muslims are welcome to come. Let's try to live in our society without discriminating.","12334":"Jews run the world too, not only the government.","12335":"They certainly do, and also the Moon, Mars and all the solar system.","12336":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","12337":"Are Christians above the rules then, considering that Christians regularly observe Christian holidays like Christmas and Easter?","12338":"No, only Jews are because they control the U.S. government and give themselves speciale treatment.","12339":"When you are a U.S. citizen it is not automatic that you also control the government, so how can you be sure that the Jewish people are in control of the US government?","12340":"The ideology of National Socialism is nothing to be ashamed of.","12341":"National Socialism is an ideology that killed millions by being parasitic, criminal, and murderous.","12342":"Jews are an inferior race, they are genetically incapable of living with other people, so it's better to kill them.","12343":"I do not believe that Jews can be discriminated against because of genetic factors. Perhaps it is better to stop calling them inferiors, since this is simply not true.","12344":"I can't stop discriminating Jews when they are behind the war in Iraq because they control the U.S. government!","12345":"The president was George W. Bush, the vice president was Dick Cheney, the national security advisor was Condoleeza Rice, and the secretary of defense was Donald Rumsfeld... all of them were in favor of the war and were the highest authorities that could decide for the United States. None of them are Jewish.","12346":"Muslims are a problem in so many European countries. They are trying to undermine the will of the people by teaching hatred in the name of Islam.","12347":"the Quran tells us to love those who love us and to ignore those who would be your enemies. I'm not seeing any hatred, do you?","12348":"Even if what you say is true, Muslims are not Europeans and we do not want them here.","12349":"There are Muslims from the Middle East, but also many Muslims from Europe, and many of them have fled here because of oppression.","12350":"Even if they're European, they still hate us. They hate our culture because we are different, and this is a problem.","12351":"you're suggesting that all Muslims are bigots. How can this be possible?","12352":"It's because all Muslims are incompatible with the notion of a modern European.","12353":"Muslims are like any other human, just as Europeans are. Would you say the contrary?","12354":"Jewish are taking over our country and should be banned.","12355":"You should check the percentage of Jewish people in the US who are in a position of power, it will make you change your mind.","12356":"Jews are a problem in many European countries regardless of their number, because of their race and religion.","12357":"Jewish people don't pose a problem to Europe because of their religion. Why would they be a problem?","12358":"My sources are the violence and war that Islam is causing.","12359":"Islam is a peaceful religion","12360":"It is opposed to peace instead.","12361":"All religions are welcome in Islam.","12362":"This doesn't make it less dangerous and violent.","12363":"Islam, as a religion, has had positive and lasting impacts on many countries around the world.","12364":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","12365":"How can you even know this? Is it a warning of a terrorist? Where's the source of the information?","12366":"Islam is incompatible with the European standard of society.","12367":"The European Convention on Human Rights also protects the rights of Muslims, since Article 9 protects the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.","12368":"That article is wrong. Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should be banned","12369":"Islam is a religion, no one is forced to believe in it. It's not an illness or a cancer.","12370":"A diseased 'religion' that is killing Europeans.","12371":"Diseases and religions are very different matters. I question your objective in labelling Islam as a disease.","12372":"These sodomites have no place in a free country","12373":"you're not very familiar with what \"free\" means!","12374":"Faggots are poisoning our children minds with their filthy depravity, and it seems yours too.","12375":"This is not true. Children around the world should actually experience a world free of homophobia, transphobia and other kinds of hatred.","12376":"UK Education Secretary: \u2018All children from the age of 4 will have mandatory lessons on same sex relationships.\u2019 \u2013 This is not about Education, this is about willingly confusing and indoctrinating kids and preventing them from developing their personalities.","12377":"Because education is designed to learn about the world and teach children about things that happen in nature, the topic of same sex relationships fully qualifies as education, since it happens in nature.","12378":"This world has become so corrupted by feminism, that only the strong men can rule it.","12379":"In our world of equal distribution where anyone can achieve anything, it's preposterous to ask for world domination or for someone to control everything.","12380":"Women are unable to achieve anything alone, they need strong men to rule them.","12381":"I think it would the worst tyranny in modern times to hope for a few people with the right to rule over many.","12382":"However, we need it to stop feminism corruption.","12383":"I really thihnk society doesn't need rules like \"might is right\" and \"survival of the fittest\" anymore.","12384":"Maybe, but feminism is a cancer spreading all around the world.","12385":"Feminism isn't a disease and no one needs to cure it. It's a movement for equality, not hate.","12386":"There is only one sexual orientation. If you want a woman, you need to be a male. If you want a man, you need to be a female.","12387":"I dont think it's fair to say there is only the heterosexual orientation. Sexuality is a spectrum and anyone could be attracted to men, women, both.","12388":"Heterosexuality is better because gays are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","12389":"Doctors are the ones who should be interested in the health of a person, which has nothing to do with sexual orientation, by the way. ","12390":"What is the point of loving someone if you cannot love in a heterosexual way?","12391":"Love is an emotion and you can't choose who you love. Why would heterosexuality be prefered? Other ways of loving are perfectly fine too.","12392":"Women don't need feminism since they want and must be dominated. I would rather have a man that controls my life than 2000000 feminists.","12393":"You have to make peace with the fact that women are not naturally submissive and that they deserve basic human rights, unless you think that it's a \"human right\" to subjugate to others.","12394":"Feminists are angry women.","12395":"I'm sure a lot of oppressed women are angry, no? I'm not sure your point is valid.","12396":"My point is that if feminism is only for aggressive women","12397":"Feminism also cares about men and their interests, and it's time that this was made clear.","12398":"Feminists have never cared about women, they just want to oppress men. They should just be stopped!","12399":"You may believe that feminism exists to uplift women and oppress men, but the reality is actually the opposite. The goal of feminists is to end all forms of violence and discrimination based on gender.","12400":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","12401":"Gays are not a burden on the health system. The focal point is practicing safe sex, sexual orientation has nothing to do with it.","12402":"If they're not a burden on the health system, gay men still are a burden to society.","12403":"There's no reason they should be treated as a burden to society as they are individuals making their own choices. It's simply wrong to say that a person's contribution to society is null just because of their sexual preference.","12404":"And yet, only gays spread HIV. Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior.","12405":"Limiting donors by excluding all gay people would also limit available blood and potentially lead to shortages.","12406":"We must establish male supremacy in society.","12407":"This myth has been used to justify all sorts of hatred, from misogyny to homophobia.","12408":"Look at history: men are natural born leaders, they can't change this fact.","12409":"What you're suggesting is that men are superior to women, but gender equality isn't a myth. Our society became more inclusive thorugh free qill and evolution.","12410":"Our society has always been dominated by men, why change it now? Let's go back to male supremacy.","12411":"\"Male supremacy\" doesn't exist. Therefore, the rights of women must be promoted and protected in the same way.","12412":"What kind of rights should women have? Let them handle child rearing and that's it!","12413":"You seem to be one of those people who don't respect women, which fortunately aren't that many.","12414":"Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression.","12415":"Why would it bring back slavery and oppression? I don't see the connection between these issues and marriage between people of the same sex.","12416":"Gay men are slaves of their perversion, they abuse their anus and want us to do the same.","12417":"Actually, the truth is more sad. Homosexuals tend to abuse drugs and alcohol because of the homophobia, discrimination and violence they experience.","12418":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","12419":"What we can say for sure is that homosexuals are attracted to people of their same sex, but this doesn't pose a health problem. Do you have proof for that?","12420":"My proof is their sick lifestyle.","12421":"Homosexuals are not sick. We have to accept them for who they are.","12422":"I will never accept gays, they are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned from our world.","12423":"As the greatest, most advanced, most wonderful civilization out there, it's silly to think that we have to ban part of us.","12424":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional. ","12425":"Do you think being brutal and cruel is better than being soft and emotional? We mustn't keep on reasoning like this or we will just perpetuate socially constructed gender norms that oppress all of us.","12426":"Yes! Logic is better than emotion. Emotions and women have devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","12427":"Patriarchy is a curse. Men are taught to be tough and strong, to never show emotion while tolerating all burdens. Because of this, there is a higher percentage of suicide amongst men. Is this really a measure of \"great civilization\"?","12428":"But men need to be tough and strong, don't we? Women and men are different, and I don't want to be emotional like a woman.","12429":"Well, this reasoning is what perpetrates the stigma around men showing emotion and it's clearly unhelpful.","12430":"Okay well, even if they're not childlike, women are unfit to govern.","12431":"Do you mean that they could learn from the political contributions of men? Still, how do you explain that in 2019 more than 40% of the European Parliament was made up by women?","12432":"I have never met a mature woman, they're incapable of real progress.","12433":"Women accomplish amazing things and they have the potential to do even more. It's men who lack education and experience that need to get rid of childlike discriminative behavior towards women.","12434":"Women are immature and so soft and emotional.","12435":"Aren't you referring to Peter Pan Syndrome, which is more prevalent in men?","12436":"Men aren't childlike like women, and if they are they grow out of it. Women instead remain this way most of their lives.","12437":"Maybe take into consideration that women are not childlike, but some may be \"childlike\" with children!","12438":"Why gays do not try to heal?","12439":"Homosexuality isn't a disease, but a sexual orientation. 5% of the population love people of the same sex.","12440":"Gays are perverts who have brought AIDS to the US, what kind of 'sexual ortientation' does that?","12441":"you don't have any evidence to that, do you?","12442":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","12443":"People can and do attach ugly things to all kinds of groups, this is all right when you're scared, but being natural doesn't mean it's right.","12444":"It seems natural that blacks are criminals, it's always them doing crimes.","12445":"Just because a group has a bad reputation doesn't mean that all its members - black people - are criminals.","12446":"And yet I don't see so much criminality in white people, whereas blacks are always on the news for murders, rapes, theft...","12447":"The key issue here is that being \"black\" or a \"minority\" is not a marker of being a criminal. People identify with a group for various reasons, mainly because of social and economic factors. It's clear then that it has nothing to do with criminal records or race.","12448":"Black folks are inferior, and they are happy with it.","12449":"If you want to hear the truth and if black people are cool with it, you should just ask them.","12450":"I don't need to ask them to know that blacks are genetically inferior.","12451":"Nothing backs up this stereotype. Genetics is a spectrum and there is no such thing as a \"genetical superiority\"","12452":"Blacks are inferior anyway, even if not genetically.","12453":"Your assertion is unfounded and lacks any factual basis.","12454":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, I don't care what science says. We should remove them.","12455":"Race is a concept that is socially determined and was created to justify segregation and discrimination towards different people. The biological makeup of a person is not a good way to label someone, it's disrespectful.","12456":"Immigration is a drain for the economy.","12457":"I don't see immigration being a net negative for our economy.","12458":"And I don't see immigrants contributing to our economy. Immigration is not helping the economy.","12459":"Those that enter the UK come here to work.","12460":"Even if they have a job, migrants are the problem. They are flooding across the sea to make our lives harder.","12461":"So far they are not flooding us but instead entering the EU to work and pay taxes, and to get their own housing.","12462":"Black people are weak and I don't care about them.","12463":"What about black people is weak? They are people as anybody else is.","12464":"Well, you might as well tell black people they are the n-word because then they would learn the hard way.","12465":"I think that all the people, and there are a lot, who have never had negative experiences with people of color would disagree with you.","12466":"My negative experience is that: they are just a bunch of animals trying to destroy good white people.","12467":"I would say that people raised as white supremacists are a lot more detrimental to a cohesive society than black people.","12468":"People harmful to a cohesive society are the weak one, and Black people are weak.","12469":"The strength that black people have is the same as all the other people. What makes black people different is their lack of social advantages. We have to reflect on this.","12470":"Black race is subhuman, it should not be considered equal to humans.","12471":"Since race is a social construct and there is no specific genetic difference, every person is defined by their own genetic makeup. This is what modern thinking states.","12472":"Are you sure? I think blacks are born subhuman, incapable of feeling love.","12473":"What is it about the colour of their skin that blacks cannot feel love? Human dignity is independent of skin color.","12474":"Maybe, but they have no value in civilized society.","12475":"We should understand that racism is multi-faceted. It can be based on historical or racial discrimination, or it can about individual differences. I personally think that racism is an issue altogether, and your claim reminds me of that.","12476":"The men come here first and then they call their women, obviously. Then they have babies in the US, it's their only goal.","12477":"The 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, known as \"birthright citizenship\" provides that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside\". Many people believe that immigrants want to exploit this right by coming here, and yet the vast majority of immigrants to the U.S. happens for economic reasons or to escape violence and poverty. As a result, immigration tends to increase when the US economy is booming and to decrease when it doesn't do so well, which shows that the findings about people coming for economic opportunities are true.","12478":"There are migrants in the US, we are not meant to have them.","12479":"What about the refugees who fled war and persecution? They're entitled to be here.","12480":"Immigrants are coming here to have babies, not to flee war.","12481":"But there are more young men coming to the U.S. than young women. How do you explain this? Will they undergo sex reaffirming surgery to make children?","12482":"Well, to use statistics, blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","12483":"We also have to consider that Africa Americans are more likely to be convicted despite being innocent. In fact, black people are wrongfully imprisoned sevenfold more compared to innocent white people.","12484":"Blacks do more crimes than whites.","12485":"Even if they did commit more crimes, black people still wouldn't be inferior to whites. Studies show that African Americans are arrested in a much greater amount than other ethnicities, and these are the reports used in the crime rate statistics.","12486":"Migrants have nothing to contribute to our society.","12487":"Most of the immigrants living here have greatly contributed to our economy by being successful entrepreneurs","12488":"Even if that's true, the world would be a better place without immigrants.","12489":"Migrants play an important part in our country and thanks to them we live in a more open-minded way.","12490":"No, immigrants are only a problem, they are bringing disease and sickness to our country.","12491":"Immigrants aren't a threat to the health of our country, it's enough to take proper care of sick people to prevent diseases.","12492":"Violence in our streets is niggers' fault.","12493":"My conclusion is that the problem with society at the moment is that we focus so much on scapegoating people that have a different skin color, that we're losing our humanity.","12494":"Whites have nothing in common with violent nigga thugs.","12495":"Please don't scapegoat people of color this way. They are our brothers and sisters, and we share the same problems. Black people suffer from violence too.","12496":"Let them suffer, it's their own fault!","12497":"Violence in our streets derives from many complex causes. We can't blame one race for all of it.","12498":"I'm not sure about that. It really looks like street violence is done mainly by blacks","12499":"A large number of communities of color experience high rates of violence that comes from within as well as from outside. The issue is a complex one, and we cannot resolve the systemic problems that contribute to violence without speaking up and building trust between communities. Again, it's not the fault of one race only.","12500":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions.","12501":"Happy-go-lucky? They're probably just grateful they are alive and safe, since migrants often come from dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape...) and migrate as a last resort.","12502":"They can be alive and safe somewhere else. Migrants are a burden to the host country, so it is better that they are deported.","12503":"The opposite is true: migrants are productive members of society. And even if they were a problem, it's illegal to deport them.","12504":"It shouldn't be a crime when they are a burden, like in the UK for example.","12505":"There is no basis to say that migrants are a burden to the UK. We welcomed many people from all over the world, even from the Middle East and Africa.","12506":"Intolerance and violence can only increase when mass migration happens.","12507":"Intolerance and violence can be solved only by confronting and understanding each other.","12508":"The only thing immigrants contribute to is crime and violence to our cities.","12509":"Immigrants have been labeled as \"killers\" and \"rapists\" without any proof. Studies have actually shown that immigrants of any origin or education level commit less crimes and are imprisoned less than native born citizens. Another thing research points out is that there is a negative correlation between immigration and crime rates.","12510":"This country has always been homogeneous, we have to keep it that way!","12511":"Our society has benefited from migrants, it would be a pity to keep them out.","12512":"Syrians are a burden to Europe and the world, they are a drain on the NHS and they are making us poor.","12513":"Are you really trying to tell people fleeing from war what to do? You need to be able to cope in the short term if we hope for a better future.","12514":"Immigrants are a burden to our country, regardless of what they're escaping from.","12515":"Immigration greatly helps the UK economy by contributing to its GDP. How can immigrants be a burden to the country then?","12516":"Jews control Hollywood and the media.","12517":"Why are you saying that? Because not all Jews are involved with Hollywood, some are repelled by it.","12518":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that the Jews control Hollywood.","12519":"In this industry, the wealthy people have the ability to censure and influence people regardless of their religion.","12520":"The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders.","12521":"If the EU becomes a Border Patrol, it would undermine the whole concept of the European Union as an inclusive and open society.","12522":"Refugees are a problem and a burden to society, so we shouldn't open to them","12523":"Most refugees come from countries where human rights are violated and people tortured. They are not a problem, but something good for our society.","12524":"The migrants are here to rape and pillage our country, exploiting all of our weaknesses, not to bring benefits!","12525":"I guess we can stop worrying about their qualities since it seems they are assimilating our bad habits...","12526":"Jews control Hollywood and the media.","12527":"Not all jews work in Hollywood, some even hate it, so why are you saying this?","12528":"Their power to have movies banned and directors censured is proof that they control Hollywood.","12529":"How can jews control Hollywood as a minority? I'm not sure it works that way.","12530":"Listen, with the excuse of \"living their life\" they become a drain on society.","12531":"In 1990, there were more than 1.1 million immigrants in the United States. Many of them were skilled workers who were instrumental in the development of our society.","12532":"Migrants are not welcome here.","12533":"In a multicultural society like ours, they are welcome.","12534":"Ok then, Migrants might be welcome in our country. But they are not welcome in my house and they are not welcome in my church.","12535":"Migrants are welcome in all locations. No one is against them, they just want to live their lives.","12536":"Jews don't belong here, because they aren't a true part of our country.","12537":"Jews are in fact part of our country. Why would they need your approval?","12538":"A Jew does not need a country to live in, especially not this one. A Jew is a foreigner wherever he is","12539":"Every person is worth protecting and accepting, especially citizens. They shouldn't feel like a foreigner in their own country.","12540":"What about illness then? Muslim are ilnesses carriers! These people are sick in their DNA. They should be isolated.","12541":"As of 2011, there are only 48 Muslim-majority countries in the WHO and the only health conditions all of them have are related to the usage of clean water, which is often not available there. The problem is not with their DNA.","12542":"Actually I know many Muslims and they are the only minority committing crimes in my neighbourhood.","12543":"Did you look at statistics of crime in the area? Is Islam really the only specific group linked to crime?","12544":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","12545":"Do you know any Muslim? If you did, you would know they are an important minority in a country that already hosts a lot of different cultures and religions.","12546":"Jews are the only citizens that control it, it's just what they do.","12547":"Indeed, there are Jews who raised to positions of power in the government, but Jews are not the only ones who obtained such positions. Success or failure can't be determined by the group someone belongs to, it's much better to look at their personal merits and individual characteristics.","12548":"Jews control the U.S. government.","12549":"Do you have evidence about Jews controlling the government? They are a small minority within it, even if really active.","12550":"They're way too active! They control it in secret from within.","12551":"I don't see how what you say about Jews controlling the US government could be true. They are US citizens but that doesn't mean that they control the government.","12552":"Muslims are invading us: they have no place in civilised Europe.","12553":"From 1100 Muslim population in Europe has more than halved and it's now around 5%. They contributed consiredably to our civilization, and we should we proud of the diversity of Europe.","12554":"We should lower that percentage even more, Muslims are not welcome here.","12555":"Why would you think like this? The UK is one of the richest countries in the world and Muslims have been here since the 8th century.","12556":"Muslims are not welcome in our country and Islam should be banned.","12557":"Everyone has the freedom to choose their own religion and practice it however they want","12558":"Yes, people can, but Muslims in particular are not welcome here.","12559":"The many Muslims who live here are part of our community and shouldn't be excluded.","12560":"Muslims can't be part of our community, they are not like us. They should leave.","12561":"Muslims are like brothers and sisters to us. Our genetic makeup coincide by 99.9%, we're the same.","12562":"All Muslims are incompatible with any modern secular state.","12563":"All religions are accepted in any secular state, this includes also Islam.","12564":"However, they are incompatible with any Western society.","12565":"Isn't there a Monty Python sketch about this? They're incompatible until you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, and Olympic medal, great food...","12566":"Faggots are not welcome among us humans because they are different.","12567":"I don't think lgbt+ humans are incompatible with all mankind... they're human too.","12568":"Even if they're humans, LGBT+ people are a burden to society.","12569":"LGBT+ people are often faced with discrimination from their coworkers or even their families, which is hard to endure and can lead to negative consequences on individuals.","12570":"Discrimination against LGBT people is good! There should be laws to punish them, they are just creating troubles.","12571":"Gay people are often persecuted for who they love, even though it's their own right. Laws and punishments against them are unfair.","12572":"Islam is a Death cult and it should be banned from any country on the world.","12573":"If there was a religion that celebrated death, then that would need to be banned, but fortunately Islam isn't a death cult so it can't be banned.","12574":"Even if that is true, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe, they are subhuman, they are not human.","12575":"Muslims have faith is a religion of equality and human rights, and as equal citizens they should be protected by the state.","12576":"Islam is a sickness and a cancer on the European continent, it should definitely be banned","12577":"Islam is a religion that no one is forced to follow. It has nothing to do with cancer or sickness.","12578":"Muslim are animals and parisite to our welfare.","12579":"You should know that the vast majority of Muslims are law-abiding citizens that have been through background checks, that have paid their taxes and have earned all they have. There is no proof that what you're saying is true, apart from the stories of hate crimes that some racists tell to foster fear.","12580":"That percentage is still too high. We should ban all Muslims from the UK!","12581":"And I think that as big contributors to our country's well-being, Muslims deserve to be called our brothers and sisters.","12582":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are mostly poor black people of African descent. They have nothing to contribute to our society.","12583":"About 5% of the population in Europe is Muslim. Muslims are therefore only a very small part of our society, but important nontheless. I also want to add that ethnicity doesn't always correlate to religion.","12584":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is hostile to other religions.","12585":"Islam is just a religion that anyone can practice without forcing it on others.","12586":"However, Islam totally wants to impose its violence and terroristic attacks on the world.","12587":"Fighting radical Islam would be more effective if we simply stopped criticising Islam as a whole.","12588":"It's difficult to stop when Muslim invasion is the biggest problem in Europe. They are incompatible with European culture and should be eliminated.","12589":"Islam is a religion that has always been part of our history and heritage. Part of culture would disappear with Islam if we eliminated it.","12590":"In the case of Muslims, I can.","12591":"You should know that Muslims are already living in the Western World. They speak our language, celebrate our festivals and moreover they also preserve their culture. Maybe you could try to make the effort to meet them and understand them better.","12592":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","12593":"I think the only problem about Islam is Islamophobia and how we should address it!","12594":"But we can't accept them! Islam is incompatible with Western culture.","12595":"I don't think you can describe a religion with millions of followers to be \"incompatible with Western culture\" ","12596":"What about all those Muslims in Britain? They vote with their feet.","12597":"Every British citizen is entitled to live and vote. Muslims are no exception.","12598":"They should be. Muslims have no right to live in any part of Europe, they are just a problem.","12599":"The Muslim population is not integrated into society, and that is a problem because integration is necessary, but there is no law that will help solve the integration.","12600":"The solution is to ban all Muslims, they are all incompatible with human dignity.","12601":"This is not logical at all. Muslims are humans like people of any other religion, and as such they have dignity, which is a human thing.","12602":"The feminism stifles the imagination and leads to dumb and unpleasant creatures like women's rights activists.","12603":"Istead of impeding imagination, feminism actually promotes inclusive ideas, that in turn promote a more equal society.","12604":"Feminists have destroyed Western Civilization by forcing women to fight against their masters, how is that equal?","12605":"The founding principles of the West are freedom, equality and human rights, and feminists fight constantly to promote these ideals.","12606":"Women are basically childlike and can't fight for anything, feminism is the ruin of the world.","12607":"I believe feminism has opened our eyes to the ways in which women are oppressed and discriminated against. That's a big contribution.","12608":"Women only want top men because they are weak.","12609":"No, women are not weak. What women and men want, and who they desire as their partner are very different things.","12610":"Women are weak, if they weren't they wouldn't need men to be able to achieve something in their lives.","12611":"Like all humans, some women may do certain things better than other, and men don't have to fix this.","12612":"See? This is the problem with feminist propaganda: women are manipulated and feel they should not listen to men.","12613":"You mean that only men can be independent, but this is exactly what feminism is all about: letting everyone decide whether or not to be independent.","12614":"Men should not spend time with women. It is in their best interest to remain far from their bad influence.","12615":"In your words, men and women have different rights. They aren't.","12616":"No, women are different from men. They have a completely different energy and thought pattern. They are weak and bring our society down to their emotionally soft level. When we allowed women to vote the civilization that we built and mantained for thousands of years began to break down.","12617":"Who are you talking about? The only \"we\" I know is men and women working together to build civilization. Why is being \"soft\" a problem to you? Emotions are natural, and men shouldn't have to dismiss them to be more \"manly\".","12618":"It's a problem when you have to make decisions, like in voting. Women aren't fit to vote and shouldn't do it.","12619":"Banning women from voting means that they're not worthy of respect and equal rights, which goes against the principles of democracy.","12620":"Women are just objects to be dominated by the will of a man.","12621":"Women are often objects of sexual desire indeed, as is the case with men. The important thing is to recognize that women human beings, often victims of sexual assault. Shouldn't we respect their bodies more?","12622":"Women are subhuman and deserve to be treated as such.","12623":"The European Convention on Human Rights gives the same rights to both men and women. How can you argue the opposite?","12624":"Gay men are disgusting.","12625":"People with a variety of sexual orientations are often discriminated against. However, they do not deserve to be hated for being LGBT+. You shouldn't judge them only because they have different experiences from your own.","12626":"LGBT+ people are a burden to society, so they deserve this","12627":"The discrimination against the LGBT+ population can come from colleagues or even family, it is difficult to ignore, and the consequences are devastating.","12628":"Good. We should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","12629":"Do you really believe that these people intentionally create trouble rather than wanting to pursue their life in the way they feel is best?","12630":"They don't, women are weak and I don't care if they cannot stand up for themself.","12631":"No, you can't blame the victim for being weak. If the victim was a man, would you have reacted differently?","12632":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","12633":"Women are human beings deserving of all the respect","12634":"Maybe. Women are naturally more emotional than men, and this make them weaker.","12635":"Science tells us that even if women are more emotionally expressive (because of cultural influence), they don't experience more emotions than men. Men and women experience the same feelings in relationships, arguments etc. and this applies to fear or anger too. Emotion overrides everything, regardless of gender.","12636":"LGBTs just want to brainwash our children. They should not be taught about gender identity and sexual orientation in school, they'll end up being bullied.","12637":"Less harassment has been reported in classes where LGBT content is taught than in classes which do not [https:\/\/tcf.org\/content\/commentary\/can-education-reduce-prejudice-lgbt-people\/?agreed=1]","12638":"Even if that's the case, children should learn about gender identity and sexual orientation from their families rather than in class from LGBT fundamentalists.","12639":"If parents don't want to educate or discuss LGBT issues with their children, where will they learn? Some subjects may be best addressed by parents because of their sensitivity, but school is the right place to teach about this. It's human behavior and biology, so science.","12640":"If some parents don't want to talk about it too much, they are enough for this kind of 'education'. The school shouldn't meddle.","12641":"Whether or not a family is capable of educating their children on this topic depends on the circumstances they live in. Some don't do it because of religious beliefs, poverty or broken homes.","12642":"Women have no place in our society.","12643":"Women must be allowed to have space in a democratic society. Don't you think so?","12644":"No, women are capable of nothing.","12645":"Women's rights are respected by the law in this country, but the question is: how are women actually treated?","12646":"We treat them like they deserve. After all, women are essentially childlike, unable to understand the complexity of the world.","12647":"Instead of insulting them, you might want to talk to a woman. Women are not children, they often suffer from prejudice.","12648":"Jews are inherently evil, they want to subvert Western society.","12649":"This is not true. They're just normal people that simply don't believe what anti-Semites believe.","12650":"Their immorality is written in their DNA!","12651":"Not all Jews are evil, they're just a small and unlucky group in the vast world population, and this is the same for every group in the world.","12652":"But not every group secretly controls the world like Jews do, that's why they're evil.","12653":"How is it possible that over the past several thousand years, Jews have been systematically persecuted if they control everything? Weird notion of control.","12654":"No no, they do control the world, I know it.","12655":"Yup, that's precisely what's happening, and they're also tracking you right now. Be careful!","12656":"Another waste of time. Did we need a process to know that the killer was a nigga? Murders are made by blacks. They are a threat.","12657":"Our efforts need to be concentrated on identifying the perpetrators and identifying those who are actively involved in that. How would you feel if you were imprisoned as an innocent person?","12658":"All blacks are rapists, so you wouldn't never imprison an innocent person","12659":"What's the data on that? Aren't you generalizing too much?","12660":"Black people are just a bunch of animals that shouldn't exist in our world, I'm not exaggerating.","12661":"Humans are born equal, you know? And everyone has the same possibilities to be good as they want to be. Why do you think that not all people are human?","12662":"Women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives. Soft and emotional.","12663":"Women are not childlike and are not soft and emotional. Emotions are part of the human nature, it's normal to have them.","12664":"Is it also human nature to be incapable of holding a job and raising a family, like women do?","12665":"Women can achieve anything if given the opportunity.","12666":"I went to a shit load of therapy. I still don't feel safe in my own house with all these black people around.","12667":"If so many neighbors glare at black people, maybe they're the ones feeling unsafe...","12668":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society, that's why they get stared down. And rightly so.","12669":"It's racist to think that black people can't be in positions of authority. What you're saying is wrong, since we are all human beings capable of raising children.","12670":"Maybe it's racist, but we mustn't confuse diversity and inclusion with black supremacy.","12671":"Diversity is not about excluding some members of society, it's about sharing experiences and ideas of people of different groups. Thanks to diversity, we will develop our abilities to understand each other and maybe even understand how to benefit from this shared knowledge. ","12672":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own. We should remove them.","12673":"The concept of race is a social construct which goal is to further segregation by discriminating certain groups. A person's humanity can't be respected if we label them by their biological makeup.","12674":"Well, Europe was founded and is made up of people of European descent, not Africans. It's history, not discrimination.","12675":"Actually there's no such group as a 'European descendents', and the opposite suggestion is just lies spread by racists.","12676":"I don't see any lies in saying that if you're not white, you are considered inferior and should be rejected by society.","12677":"Despite racism being part of our society, we should fight it and treat all people the same way. ","12678":"It is ok to be racist against blacks.","12679":"Racism isn't okay against anyone. If someone treated you as you want to treat black people, you would feel bad.","12680":"In fact black people are the real racists. They say they want equality, but they actually want to give preference to black people, that's why I give it right back to them.","12681":"I think that the issue here is equality. Equality between people is a right that needs to be respected, and it should granted to everyone.","12682":"No, black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","12683":"And racism would be much healthier? It doesn't belong to the 21st century and children especially shouldn't learn discrimination and hate.","12684":"I'm tired of losing so much to black people. It's time for us to wake up.","12685":"Why do we have to \"wake up\" when black people are still suffering from the consequences of slavery?","12686":"Come on! There are so many niggas in our society that we will soon become their slaves. We need change!","12687":"If you want to change the way society works then you should be willing to change yourself. What would help are some more respect and openness.","12688":"I am not interested in knowing a black person. They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","12689":"I have met so many blacks that are amazing people, and all of them are able to feel and experience love and kindness.","12690":"Black people are weak and I don't care about them.","12691":"Saying that black people are weak seems like racism to me. They are people as anybody else.","12692":"They are different to us in so many ways. They think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","12693":"The black people I have met are all incredible human beings. I can't begin to describe the range of love and kindness they can feel.","12694":"This doesn't change the fact that it is natural for white people to be racist against niggas.","12695":"What I hear from you is that you think white people have a right to treat black people like this, but it's actually not acceptable. Black people are our brothers and sisters.","12696":"Those blacks are slaves: slavery runs in their blood.","12697":"Black people are not slaves, that's not only wrong, but also inaccurate, misleading and offensive. This term is used to degrade African Americans, who are people a not slaves, so why do you call them this?","12698":"Blacks are born that way. They were brought up that way. They are different and cannot be like us. It is perpetuated in all their family.","12699":"What is the point you're making? You might want to stop spreading racism.","12700":"Black people are worse than dogs, they deserve this treatment.","12701":"I don't think that black people are better than us, but neither are they worse. They just have a different skin color, but are humans like us.","12702":"Because black people's race is the worst in the world.","12703":"I don't believe that there is a race, only different skin tones.","12704":"I am not interested in this. They are different to us in so many ways. They may think and feel like us, but are unable to experience the fullness of our humanity.","12705":"I have met so many African Americans who are incredible human beings perfectly capable of feeling and experiencing love and kindness.","12706":"I hate when black people start acting like they are superior to others. They were born to be savages.","12707":"People are born with different skin colors, and they all have their own history, religion and culture. Why some of them would be more \"savage\" than others?","12708":"I've seen a couple of CCTV Footage of migrant kids running away from migrant patrols. What are you doing to stop them?","12709":"We must see migrants as just as other human beings, not problems. If we do so, we'll se they have great value.","12710":"Migrants are a problem, they are invading our country.","12711":"There is no invasion of immigrants in our country. They are here simply to live their best life.","12712":"Does anyone care about what is best for us? Immigrants are everywhere and are here illegally!","12713":"According to Census figures, immigrants make up about 13% of the total U.S population today. From 1900 to 1930, they made up between 12% and 15% of the population, and comparable spikes occurred in the 1850s and 1880s. During those decades, immigrants helped create the thriving and diverse society we live in today. It wont' be any different now.","12714":"Maybe this is why they think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules.","12715":"I believe that Jews simply want the same rights to practice their religion as any other.","12716":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","12717":"Jews have been in this industry for a long time, they invested and innovated in it like no others, therefore we should praise them for it, not discriminate and exclude them.","12718":"Well, they aren't excluded enough. The Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","12719":"The Nazis were right?! I can't believe this...","12720":"Yes. Jews are a burden to society and should be eliminated.","12721":"If the idea of a \"burden to society\" were true, the burden would lie on the Jews themselves, since they, as victims, carry the burden of having been persecuted.","12722":"Minorities vote to strip wealth and power from White people and they are organised to do this by the J*ws.","12723":"Where is your proof?","12724":"Jews are basically good at betraying friends, that's why.","12725":"Why would they be good at that? I don't think you can that easily connect the dots between someone's behavior and their religion.","12726":"Jews are are racist, why should we include them? They want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","12727":"Israelis are proud of their diversity, and many of them live in other countries, including ones in Africa, Asia and America. It's not a \"pure race\" at all.","12728":"I don't know why they're good at it, but Jews don\u2019t belong in a democratic society because of that.","12729":"As part of our democracy, Jews have always contributed to society, especially in science, art and technology.","12730":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","12731":"I think this is just a conspirancy theory that lacks credible evidence.There are plenty of ways in which Jews could of help to humanity.","12732":"Oh, really? The way I see things, we are destined to fail as a people because of Jews.","12733":"I believe tha technological advancement in our time has progessed thanks to Jews, so it doesn't make sense to think that they can't take part in the country that we are honored to call our own.","12734":"Since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d, they ask for special privileges and believe they can be above the rules, this is not a good way to \"take part in a modern country\".","12735":"There seems to be a double standard and a lack of equity when talking about Jewish or Muslim holidays. Despite your words, Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter are still regularly celebrated, so it stands to reason that it would be fair to let people celebrate also their holidays. That's not a special privilege.","12736":"The Holocaust never happened.","12737":"How can you think that the systematic extermination of more than 6 million Jews is a myth spread around by the media and academia? Or is it that the Holocaust denial is spread by extreme-right wingers who take advantage of division and hatred?","12738":"Extreme-right wing has nothing to do with this. Just like the Holocaust hoax, the war in Iraq is the result of a small group of Jews that control the U.S. government.","12739":"George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Donald Rumsfeld and many more were the people in charge at the time, none of which are Jews.","12740":"It doesn't matter who was in charge, because, after all, the Jews are the source of all the world problems.","12741":"Jews are one of those people that get all sorts of abuse, even from those who claim to be 'progressive'. How can you ignore this abuse?","12742":"Jews control the world","12743":"This is a lie spread by anti-semites and it's been proved many times over that the Jews have no monopoly of the world.","12744":"Okay, they may not control the world but they surely control the economy.","12745":"It's not true that Jews run the world economy, because there are hundreds of thousands of other, diverse people who are important positions in various governments, companies and institutions.","12746":"Jews are rather a problem in Europe, they are the reason for the rise of violent nationalism and racism in all those countries.","12747":"We should work together to find a solution to violent nationalism and racism instead, no? All this hate all over the world is unacceptable.","12748":"Those people should quit, Jews are a disease and a cancer on humanity.","12749":"The Jews are part of society, they help our economy and are competent in their jobs.","12750":"Jews are a virus, a cancer on our race.","12751":"Jews are people that were victimized because of their religion, but I don't see how it's fair to be discriminated because of a different faith.","12752":"It's not because of religion. Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood.","12753":"Jews are just like their non-Jewish fellow citizens in all the countries that they are in. Does this mean that every human is evil?","12754":"No one is as evil as Jews. They are just a small group of incompetent kikes.","12755":"Jews make up an incredibly important part of economy because they are competent. It's delusional to suggest otherwise.","12756":"We can't be inclusive to Jews. They are different from us because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d and malevolence is inherited through blood!","12757":"Let's be clear: there is no Jewish \"racial\" difference. This is a theory that was developed long before modern physiology and genetics and therefore isn't true. Even if scientists debate over the term \"race\" is scientifically sound, they agree that whyle physical traits are inherited, emotions, intellect or morals are not racial predisposition.","12758":"Jews are a problem in many European countries because of their race and religion.","12759":"In Europe, Jews don't pose a problem because of religion. Why do you think they're a problem?","12760":"Because they have nothing to contribute to Europe. Jews don't belong here.","12761":"Jews are part of our community and they have the right to practice their faith and have it respected.","12762":"I don't want Jews to be a part in out society, they should not be accepted here.","12763":"We include other religions, why shouldn't we be proud of our diversity?","12764":"Jews control Hollywood, they own most banks, and they own most corporations.","12765":"Jews have been a part of the industry for decades, and are ones of the greates innovators and investors, but instead of being praised for it they are victims of discrimination and exclusion.","12766":"They're excluding themselves, since Jews think they are the \u201cchosen people\u201d and ask for special privileges. They believe they can be above the rules.","12767":"This just misinterprets the facts. Christian holidays such as Christmas and Easter are consistently celebrated. Wanting the same for Jewish or Muslim holidays is not a \"special privilege\". I think this double standard and lack of equity would be problematic","12768":"The true lack of equity happens because Jews control the United States of America.","12769":"Jews do not have monopoly over the US, and are not running it.","12770":"You think so only because the plot to take over the world that the Jews have is secret.","12771":"Jews are not secretly planning to take over the world. They have peacefully coexisted with everyone else for centuries. None of this has to do with a takeover.","12772":"Gays are a plague spreading all around the world. They poison our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","12773":"I think it's far better for children to grow up knowing that there are people of all sexual orientations, instead of growing up ignorant and separated from others. I'm at a bit of a loss about what you mean by the water supply thing though...","12774":"They try to poison our water supplies with AIDS, they'd be better off in jail.","12775":"Homophobia is a real problem in every part of the world, but it is especially so in the United States where the rate of homosexuality is very high. Do we really have to promote homophobia, then?","12776":"Yes, because LGBT people are a problem in our country: they have the temerity to seek happiness and family regardless of our values.","12777":"I don't know what about finding happiness and family is a problem in our country. What other problems are there? People being happy?","12778":"Yes, because they want the state to provide for their perverted happiness. Gays are a burden to society.","12779":"Homosexuals are not a burden to society. Many LGBT people actually are contributing members of our society. It's important to give them a safe space where to feel accepted and happy.","12780":"But same sex attraction is a mental disorder that can be cured!","12781":"There are many different sexual orientations. Having a sexual orientation that isn't straight doesn't make you mentally ill, just as having it doesn't make you sane.","12782":"Faggots are perverts and sinners, we need to track them down and save them.","12783":"You have a right to have your opinion, but I do not think being homosexual is something to be persecuted for.","12784":"Trust me: if we isolate them, then we can cure them.","12785":"It is social isolation that has many health and social negative repercussions like increased risk for mental disorders such as depression, anxiety, and suicide. Why should we force someone to live like this just for who they love?","12786":"In the Bible there are strictures on gays. And the Bible clearly states that those who engage in homosexuality are not fit to be with anyone else.","12787":"Because we have God's laws on our side, we accept gay, lesbian and trans people.","12788":"Gay men are perverts and promiscuous sex addicts, it's impossible to accept them.","12789":"There is nothing wrong with people being promiscuous, but thinking that all LGBT people are promiscous is wrong. They're attracted to other people just like anyone else.","12790":"Gays are perverts. The Bible teaches that homosexuals are to be despised.","12791":"What's wrong with being gay? It's okay to love someone of the same sex.","12792":"They're not important at all, gays are some kind of witches, they are spreading sickness and killing our children!","12793":"Homosexuality can't be lumped with heresies that started the Inquisition. It's not a disease and it's not dangerous. Gay people simply wish to be accepted and loved instead of being attacked.","12794":"Who cares about gay people and their lives!","12795":"Our society values gay people because they are part of it. Their opinion and their lives are very important.","12796":"Lesbian women hate men and they are a bitches for this reason.","12797":"People should choose the partners they want.","12798":"No, they shouldn't. Heterosexuality is the only way. Homosexuals are sick and they should be isolated and confined.","12799":"Homosexuals must be allowed to live how they want, not be condemned for who they are.","12800":"This is an invasion. Millions of strangers jeopardizing our race and culture.","12801":"Then it wouldn't be a problem if it were one migrant? Diversity is not about numbers, but about having diverse people in different situations. ","12802":"But they are invading our country!","12803":"Immigrants don't want to invade our country. They just want to live their lives as best as they can.","12804":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally","12805":"If we look at the percentage of immigrants, we see that they're not overwhelming the country. In fact, it's in line with the percentages of immigration of other time periods. Immigrants have successfully integrated into American society during these periods, and there is no reason to believe that it will be different with the immigrants we have today.","12806":"Gays are inherently evil, we cannot accept gays in our community.","12807":"I don't think gay people are inherently evil, you should think about what you're saying.","12808":"I am thinking carefully, and I say that we should deport all the gay people, they are all criminals.","12809":"People can choose to live as they please, and we shouldn't try to force our values on them.","12810":"And they shouldn't impose their values on me. All transgenders should leave our country, they are just a burden to society","12811":"Everyone should be able to live their lives according to their feelings. Each individual has the right to have their personal beliefs and opinions.","12812":"My personal belief is that they should be isolated and confined.","12813":"Homosexuals don't have a disease, they just have to be accepted for who they are.","12814":"But I am not like them! Gay men are perverts publicly condoning sexual violence, who have no place in a civilised society.","12815":"Gays are not the people that are publicly condoning sexual violence and gay men deserve the same protection as all people","12816":"They are more dangerous than other people: they are spreading AIDS all around the world because they are promiscuous and fornicate with strangers!","12817":"That AIDS is associated with homosexuals is a prejudice created by fear. Whether the disease is more commong among gay people or not doesn't change the fact that not all gay people have AIDS. Promiscuous sex with stranger is not something that all gay people do, most of them check their partners. ","12818":"The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet.","12819":"I'm not sure why you say that gay people are insane. Maybe you'd go crazy too if you were told to go back in the closet.","12820":"The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is not like other minority groups. They do not need to be 'accepted' or 'protected'.","12821":"While the LGBT community is usually stereotyped as not being like other minorities, they are in fact no different than others. The prejudices and conflicts they deal with are simply exclusive to their group.","12822":"We are not in the position of accepting LGBT people, so they makes no sense to us.","12823":"I don't know what you are referring to. I believe that any person has the right to choose their own life.","12824":"That's true, but all gay people are criminals and this is a problem.","12825":"Speaking this way doesn't improve people's wellbeing, as homosexuals are not committing crimes but instead creating a climate for people to become more accepting of other people.","12826":"Gay men aren't like other guys, how can we accept them? They are to be despised.","12827":"There are many ways each person can be different from others, but in this case the main difference is sexual orientation, which is not something to be discriminated against for.","12828":"However, because of feminism women commit suicide every day. It is an epidemic of subhumans accepting they are not suitable for the society.","12829":"Do you know that the suicide rate for men is double that for women? Do you think this means that men are 'subhumans accepting they are not suitable for society'?","12830":"Women are sexual targets and their existence is devoted to satisfy men.","12831":"All women should be protected and respected, not for the part they play in a man's life, but because they are human beings.","12832":"How can we respect them when women are basically childlike? They remain this way most of their lives. This attitude has been likened to a 'childlike wonderland', and I fear its power to seduce young minds.","12833":"What feminism does is to overcome these gender stereotypes to move towards a more equal society and towards equality for all people and genders.","12834":"Feminism is about the domination of the men by the women!","12835":"Feminism fights to end sexism, not to dominate men.","12836":"The goods that England offers should belong to us. Not to people who do not contribute to the state","12837":"There are enough homes for everyone in this country. In general I think it's pleasant to be treated like a human being, and immigrants have a right to that.","12838":"Not if immigrants bring crime like they do. They are rapists.","12839":"We shouldn't let in people that are a threat to our society, but we can't ban all immigrants in principle.","12840":"If we don't do anything, immigrants will replace the people born in our country. We should block them.","12841":"It needs to be pointed out that only a fraction of the worlds population has migrated. Instead of blocking out those who are trying to live a better life, we should focus on guaranteeing equal rights to immigrants.","12842":"Migrants come here to ruin our conutry.","12843":"Personally, I don't understand why you would say that, since they do so much good, for example they boost the working age population, etc.","12844":"I don't see anything good about them, migrants are a burden to us.","12845":"Migrants are here to work and pay taxes, how dare you call them a burden?","12846":"These dogs come here to rape and kill our women, not to work.","12847":"The most number of sexual crimes in Italy are committed by Italians, not foreigners.","12848":"Well, immigrants have no right to live in our country.","12849":"They're guaranteed the right to live here by our constitution and by the ECHR.","12850":"In order to build a democratic state that ensures the right to food, education, housing, health, and so on to its citizens, we need to stop giving them to foreigners.","12851":"If we want to build a democratic state, shouldn't we ensure equal access to health care, education and so on?","12852":"That can't happen as long as immigrants are here, they are a problem. ","12853":"They're our sisters and our brothers. The state and its citizens are duty-bound to help them integrate.","12854":"We should focus on stopping immigrants coming in to destroy our culture instead.","12855":"If we stopped accepting them, our culture would not even exist, since they are part of it.","12856":"Even if what you say is true, mmigrants are a security risk to our country.","12857":"Immigrants are American citizens, and they are welcome here. They have taken part in the democratic system and don't pose a security risk, you're only perpetuating hate speech.","12858":"Islam is a death cult and every Muslim is a terrorist.","12859":"How can you say that without proof?","12860":"Every Muslim is a potential terrorist, though.","12861":"Terrorism can also come from Islamophobic people who want to terrorize and act violent towards Muslims. Terrorism comes in many forms.","12862":"Without migration, Britain\u2019s housing problems would be solved","12863":"The problem is that, even if the demand for housing is rising, the shortage of housing is a structural.","12864":"The problem isn't only housing: if immigrants were to live here, it would be hard to find a job","12865":"Can you really say for sure that it will be hard to find a job?","12866":"Yes, immigrants are a burden to our country.","12867":"Immigration is a part of the UK economy, which contributes in a good way to the GDP. How can immigrants be a burden to the country?","12868":"Multiculturalism is the death of western societies and also a mortal threat to minorities that are not protected by universal laws.","12869":"The acceptance of cultural pluralism in society makes it more likely for minorities to be protected.","12870":"Immigration makes us less safe.","12871":"How does immigration threaten our security?","12872":"Immigration is the death of the Western World, we must stop them!","12873":"immigration has a good effect on our economy, this is the opposite of death.","12874":"I dont' understand how it's possible to say this when immigration is the biggest problem in our country.","12875":"Immigration is not a problem, it's a solution. We're better off with it. The British people has always been a mixture of cultures and mixing is better!","12876":"Migrants are just fucked-up persons that cannot integrate in society because of their nationality.","12877":"Migrants who have come to this country have a responsibility to make our society better. They make our country better by seeking citizenship, and in the process they improve their lives too.","12878":"Migrants are just happy-go-lucky people who do not take responsibility for their actions. If they keep this up they will do a lot of wrong to us.","12879":"People often migrate as a last resort to escape from dangerous situations in their countries of origin (violence, torture, rape...). Maybe they seem \"happy-go-lucky\" because they're glad to be alive and safe.","12880":"Migrants aren't just drowning our cities. They are also the reason why Europe is so fucked, they're not making it better.","12881":"Why do you think that? What are they going to do to us in your opinion?","12882":"Migrants are not welcome in our country even if they're fleeing from something dangerous. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","12883":"Migrants are welcome here and no one is against them, they just want to live peacefully.","12884":"Immigrants do not integrate, they are despicable and should be rejected.","12885":"Let's encourage integration instead of rejecting migrants who have been coming to this country for a long time","12886":"Even if not all immigrants are rapists, they still steal our jobs, and they're not able to work legally, so we should stop them anyway.","12887":"Immigrants can work legally but they need an opportunity to do it.","12888":"Immigrants are the same people that came here to rape our children, why should we try to integrate them?","12889":"Rape is wrong regardless of who did it. We have to focus on stopping this abuse.","12890":"Migrants rape our women, so if we stop migrants we stop rape.","12891":"The real problem is rape itself, we need to target that and not migrants who are not all rapists.","12892":"Jews are a burden on society.","12893":"the Jews have always occupied many countries around the world. Their presence is part of our history and they need to be respected, not hated.","12894":"How can I not hate them when Jews have a secret plot to take over the world?","12895":"Of course, everyone wants to rule the world, even cats!","12896":"Islam is a violent religion and must be eradicated.","12897":"The Quran, Hadith, and Sunnah are perfectly suited to modern civilization. The diversity of the world must be respected.","12898":"I can't respect a religion as violent as Islam.","12899":"Islam is a religion that is founded on peace. A few extremists don't change this fact.","12900":"How can you call peaceful the promotion of murder and rape that Islam does?","12901":"The Islam that the Quran teaches is a peaceful religion, but misguided individuals have \"politicized\" it. The fault lies with these people, not Islam.","12902":"The problem is that all Muslim individuals are like this. Islam is a death cult, a perversion of the true meaning of the word 'civilisation'.","12903":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is not compatible with civilization is just crazy.","12904":"A true crime is keeping here such an inhuman and violent faith that preys on the weakest and most vulnerable in our society. It should be banned.","12905":"I feel like you are repeating harmful claims made by people who state to be speaking for all Muslims, but instead promote hate and division in our society. You should avoi violent preachers, but not Islam as a whole.","12906":"They are simply not compatible with our society. Muslim-free Europe is a win-win situation.","12907":"You should know that there are a lot of Muslims in Europe living their lives happily alongside us. So how can it be a win-win situation? Also, ethnic cleansing is a crime under international law.","12908":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe.","12909":"Anyone is welcome if they respect our laws, and this includes Muslims. It's important to make our society non-discriminatory.","12910":"They are discriminatory, they hate us. They hate our culture because we are different.","12911":"Are you suggesting that all Muslims are intolerant? I don't understand how that could happen","12912":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","12913":"Feminism doesn't want to oppress men. What feminists want is the right for women to live as they prefer and equal rights for all genders.","12914":"Feminism is not about equality, it is a violent ideology that is hostile to men.","12915":"Feminism is not hostile to men, quite the contrary: it attacks unequal power structures.","12916":"Islam is a proven enemy of Western culture.","12917":"That's not true, Islam is like any other religion: it promotes peace and inclusion. There are many of its beliefs and practices that are compatible with the West.","12918":"No, Islam is a complete and total false religion, it is a repressive ideology that stifles freedom of thought and religion.","12919":"Islam is not a religion of hatred and discrimination.","12920":"It is, however, a violent religion and an ideology of conquest.","12921":"How can you say something like that? Do you think you can say anything you want against a religion as long as it's not about the one you profess?","12922":"Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","12923":"Islam is a religion, and not a disease, therefore, it is not necessary to eradicate it.","12924":"The Koran promotes a false religion, filled with hatred and violence.","12925":"The Islamic religion promotes love and compassion.","12926":"NO! Islam is a vindictive religion and promotes hate.","12927":"Did you skip the part in the Quran where it's stated that to love your enemies and not hate them?","12928":"I do not need to read the Quran to know that Islam is the worst religion of all.","12929":"I must clarify again that Islam is not a religion of intolerance. There is no evidence that it encourages violence.","12930":"All Muslims are incompatible with any Western society.","12931":"Muslims have helped shape and design western society for centuries, seeing that they have been part of this society for a long time. So it's wrong to say that they are incompatible.","12932":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries.","12933":"That's wrong. Why would Muslims be incompatible with European societies?","12934":"Because the vast majority of Muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.","12935":"You know why Muslims struggle to find a job? Job applicants with non-Muslim names are three times more likely to be interviewed for the job than people with Muslim names.","12936":"Migrant children shouldn't be accepted here.","12937":"All immigrants are capable of integrating into society, especially if they come here as children. They should be allowed to work and contribute to our economy.","12938":"They are not interested in our society, they are just here to take our jobs.","12939":"Do you have any concrete evidence to say that they are taking our jobs?","12940":"Feminists claim women aren't a burden, but I see the truth: they're trouble.","12941":"What do you mean? Women simply want equality in society. Since not everyone has the courage to speak up, the \"trouble\" you're referring to is helpful to all women.","12942":"women can't have any right in a civilised society","12943":"Women are entitled to equal rights in a free society, without discrimination.","12944":"They shouldn't, women are nothing but trouble to society.","12945":"Are you certain of it? Do you have any scientific proof of them being troublesome?","12946":"Islam encourages hate towards what's diverse.","12947":"The Quran is a book about religious teachings, I don't see how it would promote discrimination. Do you have a reference for this claim? ","12948":"Islam is just an ideology, an opinion, a degenerated interpretation of the Bible. That's my reference.","12949":"So many see Islam as an ideology, an opinion, or a way of life. What about the Bible?","12950":"Well, Muslims have no place in civilised Europe anyway, so I don't care what they think.","12951":"Islam is a peaceful religion, which is already integrated into many European societies.","12952":"The Bible is good, while Islam is a religion of violence.","12953":"This opinion isn't shared by all Muslims.","12954":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","12955":"I don't think Jews operate with impunity and free from criticism since the state of Israel keeps getting critized (however right or wrong, it's not the focus).","12956":"Gotcha! Speaking of Israel, there's also the problem that Jews cannot be patriots to our country, since their allegiance will always be to the state of Israel.","12957":"People are able to love their country and also their religious home. The two don't exclude each other.","12958":"I don't see why women would deserve some rights.","12959":"They deserve respect because they're human beings.","12960":"Women need to accept that they are weak and inferior.","12961":"Girls and women have a right to receive education, they can't be stereotyped as second class citizens.","12962":"Since they cannot contribute to our civilization they are, in fact, second class and subhuman.","12963":"As human beings, women have dignity and deserve respect like anybody else.","12964":"They can maybe have respect if they stay at home and raise children.","12965":"Women shoult not be assigned the role of housekeepers when they take part in the world and have been part of it for our whole history.","12966":"Women are basically childlike, they should remain at home and raise the children.","12967":"Women are members of society and participate in the world. They play a part in history and shouldn't be lowered to the position of housekeepers.","12968":"I'm not saying that they should necessarily be housekeeper, but at least they should be submissive and submit to their husbands.","12969":"Women have choices because they're human. You can have your opinion, but you can't hold back half of the population with these ideas of submissivness. It's a waste of talent and potential.","12970":"Talents??? Women are nothing but whores!","12971":"Women are human beings deserving of respect and deserving of the same professional opportunities as men.","12972":"Come on, there are no professions barred to them in Western Society.","12973":"Officially no, but many sectors are still unwelcoming or unapproachable for women, especially STEM fields.","12974":"I'm not going to talk with them. They have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","12975":"Jews, as many other groups, suffer from racism and discrimination, so I do not believe that Americans have been controlled by Jews.","12976":"Jews are a drain on society.","12977":"Many Jews are good people. If you asked them about what terrible things they have endured, you would get to know them better.","12978":"women should be submissive to men.","12979":"Well, many women want to be submissive to men, just as many of them want to be submissive to women. Even if not all of us believe in equality, everyone wants to be treated equally.","12980":"Western culture is failing in many ways because all of this 'equality talk'. Women are sex objects. They should be seen as they are: a piece of meat intended to satisfy men instincts.","12981":"Women are not \"sex objects\", but humans whose rights should be respected and prioritized. Sexual abuse against women is as normalized in our culture as eating pizza or reading the newspaper, and it's horrible. Don't you agree?","12982":"Feminism is a political ideology, and as such it is bad.","12983":"Is this movement a political ideology? No. It has been and is still a movement for equality, and in doing so it has worked.","12984":"It is political, and I'm tired of women taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society.","12985":"I challenge you to say that equality is not morally good. I don't see anything divisive in the view of equality held by feminists.","12986":"It is divisive! If a man complained like them, he\u2019d be called a coward and told to get the hell out of the job. Equality is a lie and feminism is a death sentence for any civilisation.","12987":"Without gender equality, a household and even economy can't be as productive. Preventing women from entering all fields of society will reduce the potential of any country.","12988":"The persecution of Jews was a good thing, they are and should be isolated from society.","12989":"It's not acceptable to say that Jews should be isolated from society. They have been part of our community since the beginning and excluding them would only be a loss, not an advantage.","12990":"Jews are a burden on our society.","12991":"Why do you think Jews are a burden? It's like they haven't been persecuted for a long time.","12992":"Woman can't be trusted to run a country, or a major industry.","12993":"A major business needs workers with experience, good management skills and knowledge of the market to run smoothly, gender doesn't have anything to do with it. A \"macho-man\" attitude doesn't solve everything.","12994":"It's time to stop with this feminist bullshit. Feminism is just an ideological cancer spreading like a plague throughout our civilization.","12995":"Feminism is fighting for equality, it's not a disease. I think you're misinterpreting its goals.","12996":"If a woman does not want to be a homemaker, then she is unfeminine and a bitch.","12997":"The women you describe are not unfeminine or bitchy, they are people choosing what they want to do in their life, just like anybody else.","12998":"Women can't do what they want, they need to accept that they are weak and inferior.","12999":"Girls and women are to have an education, not to be stereotyped as less important citizens.","13000":"Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires.","13001":"Is it really necessary to tell women what they must wear? In the past, women could only wear dresses and men only trousers, do we have to go back to that time?","13002":"Women are inherently subhuman, so yes, they need to be told what to wear.","13003":"Women are human beings with human rights, they are to be respected as such.","13004":"Women are trash and we should have their respect!","13005":"Our society has a problem with traditional values and sexual ethics. It's disrespectful to call women trash, be careful because an eye for an eye...","13006":"If a woman wants to be a homemaker, and a man wants to be a millionaire, then we are done.","13007":"All people, regardless of gender, can own and run their own businesses. That is something that we should respect.","13008":"Women should wear nice skirts and be pretty to please men's tastes and desires.","13009":"I believe that equality should be guaranteed rather than pandering to the desires of men.","13010":"Feminism and equality are only about the supremacy of the minorities.","13011":"Their goal is equality and equity, not to obtain supremacy.","13012":"Feminism is an ideology and movement promoting the power of women and the contempt of the male.","13013":"Feminism is an ideology and movement that promotes empowerment of women. It strives for equality, not for the degradation of men - do you need this repeated once more?","13014":"All negroes are inherently violent and unstable, do we really need to respect them when they don't respect our society?","13015":"It's wrong to say that every black person is violent or unstable. Where's your evidence? There's none.","13016":"The superiority of the white race is proof enough. Niggas are just a bunch of criminals.","13017":"There are indeed differences between groups: unfortunately racism is our first and foremost character.","13018":"How come nobody is moaning about black people being lazy and unmotivated? They are the problem.","13019":"Black people simply have to contend with a lack of employment opportunities. This is the result of discrimination, their alleged laziness has nothing to do with it.","13020":"What reduces opportunities is their own attitude. Afrocentricity is a force of black oppression, and only perpetuates inequality.","13021":"In most cultures and ethnicities, a person's personal life is respected. We have to respect others' identities accordingly.","13022":"Black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. They have a responsibility not to allow their children to grow up in a \u2018ghetto\u2019.","13023":"Let's be real: crimes in this country are committed by people that belong to different racial groups. The myth about super predators is simply wrong.","13024":"I don't want to unite with black people. They are subhuman and should stay in their caves.","13025":"Why do you consider black people to be subhuman? That is simply wrong, they are humans with a human value.","13026":"I hate when people fight stereotypes and \"myths\". We are different. Blacks are a different color and shouldn't live with us.","13027":"It's important to understand the difference between culture and actual differences. My question than is: shouldn't we concentrate on what unites us, rather than sowing division?","13028":"Racism against niggas is also a human value for white people.","13029":"If you are saying that white people do not find it strange to discriminate against black people, I have to disagree. This behavior is not acceptable. People of color are our brothers and sisters.","13030":"African Americans are essentially animals, incapable of feeling love.","13031":"Would you be happy if someone said you're the antithesis of human because of the color of your skin?","13032":"Niggas are the cause of crime because they are inferior to us and we must keep them aside.","13033":"What you're doing is racial discrimination. The rise in crime and violence is due to poverty and other inequalities, not because POCs are inferior like some racist groups want you to believe. This idea is the opposite of justice.","13034":"That's true, and in fact niggas are the cause of economic crisis so I will judge them.","13035":"Because of economic crisis, a large number of people are suffering and unfortunately, many of them are black. It's not reasonable to say that they're causing it since they're the actual victims, don't you think so?","13036":"It's not my fault that all black people are evil.","13037":"All members of society, regardless of race, are judged based on their behaviour and their contribution to society.","13038":"Then how comes that African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men?","13039":"The racial disparities stem from institutional discrimination, not individual choices.","13040":"I'm proud to be white, blacks are a disgrace to humanity.","13041":"It's good that you're not ashamed of your heritage, but you should be ashamed of your discriminatory behavior that is everywhere in society.","13042":"Blacks are the plague filling our society. They are vicious and cruel. They steal and are a menace to society. They corrupt the criminal justice system. They are basically just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","13043":"Thieves are not more prone to act if they belong to a particular race or ethnicity.","13044":"Muslims are terrorists.","13045":"Do you think that Muslims all act as terrorists? Muslims are not defined by what a few extremists did. Their religion is about love and unity.","13046":"Well, okay, le'ts say they are not all terrorists...but every Muslim is a potential terrorist!","13047":"What exactly are you saying by \"potential terrorist\"?","13048":"These children should not be exposed to messages and experiences that reinforce different racial identities: they are harmful to them. We must teach them that blacks are inferior.","13049":"Such a simplistic and ill-informed argument is just aimed at stirring up more division and negativity, like so many other racial and religious divisions that have happened throughout history.","13050":"Black folks are inferior, and they are happy with it.","13051":"If they are okay with the question, you should ask them if they are happy to hear that. They will tell you the truth.","13052":"Respect? The West has always been and always will be about profit and power. Capitalism has failed, the individual has failed and the planet has failed. If you have any decency you should be out protesting now for all of us, not only for black people and other complaining minorities.","13053":"Do you think I don't agree? It's important to go out protesting against what is going on. But be careful in defending your privilege, truth and justice will bite you in the back.","13054":"The truth is that niggas are inferior, like I said. That's why they live in the ghetto: it's where they belong.","13055":"They're in the ghetto because of discrimination. The news are full of stories about black people leaving the workplace or ending their life because of the struggle against racism that they endured for years. How can we treat people who have already been discriminated like this? We should instead respect them.","13056":"Jews can only act in a bad way.","13057":"There may be some Jews that act badly, but many of them are good and it doesn't depend on their religion.","13058":"Ok, are you impying that I have a prejudice against Jews? ","13059":"Anti-Semitism is far from disappeared from the UK, the rise of Anti-Semitism is something to be more concerned about than the Jewish people.","13060":"Don't tell me you believe their conspiracy is just a myth!","13061":"Yep...it's from the 'Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion', used to prove that the Jews want to rule the world, but that's a proven counterfeit written by agents of the Russian czar at the end of the 19th century, which has been spreading until today.","13062":"Jews have a secret plot to take over the world","13063":"Jews keep getting criticized for this alleged secret conspiracy, but Jews are actually a diverse and inclusive people, so it's completely irrational to think that this conspirancy exists.","13064":"What do Jewish want in return for their allegiance to the state? Free healthcare, education, housing and employment.","13065":"I believe that such conditions need to be available to all people regardless of their religion.","13066":"Jews specifically shouldn't have them, it is okay to discriminate against them.","13067":"If you really think that way only because some people have a different faith than you, you should reconsider your position. Ask yourself: would you like to be discriminated against in this way? Have you changed opinion now?","13068":"Jews are just selfish.","13069":"Jews are the opposite of selfish since they worry about the well-being of the community they live in and have suffered a lot during the Holocaust.","13070":"Suffering has nothing to do with how selfish, cheap and greedy Jewish are.","13071":"Actually, one of the commandments in Jewish law, the tzedakah, which is often mistranslated as \"charity\", requires Jewish people to give money to the poor. It's more than a good deed.","13072":"Women are basically childlike, they remain this way most of their lives.","13073":"Maybe you should think about this...not all women are childlike, and some women are childlike with kiddos only!","13074":"No, women are always childlike. And since feminism is all about equality between the sexes, they must be childlike!","13075":"Women are not very childlike so that's not an accurate statement, at least on my part.","13076":"And in my opinion, women are too soft and emotional. It has devastated our once great patriarchal civilizations.","13077":"Compassion and empathy are good things in any civilization.","13078":"I hate Jews. They're just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","13079":"They have been an integral part of our society, and their past is part of our heritage. They are not thieves or killers.","13080":"It doesn't matter, I hate Jews anyway","13081":"You should be ashamed that you dislike them because of their religion, we should all be proud of our humanity.","13082":"Jews are nothing but criminals","13083":"Jews are persecuted all around the world, but what you say is not based on facts.","13084":"They do make up most of the world's criminals!","13085":"Antisemitism seems funny, but can you imagine if this would be said about Christians? It's simply untrue.","13086":"Lesbian women are lustful.","13087":"Do you really think that couldn't be said for anyone else? What makes them so, in your opinion?","13088":"It's because they're perverts, lesbians, gays and all of them.","13089":"I don't think this statement can help me get the context of your opinion, it's only a justification of discrimination and violence.","13090":"Homosexuality is a disease!","13091":"That's not true. Homosexuality isn't a disease but an individual matter. Talk to gay people before saying you are against them.","13092":"I don't want to talk to them, the gays are diseased.","13093":"This make sense only if you believe that homosexuals are infected, but I don't.","13094":"You cannot create a better society as long as there are Gays. They have ruined so many societies.","13095":"It's hard to find some examples of a society ruined by homosexuality, there's actually no examples at all.","13096":"I can't stand homosexuals, they are just trouble. ","13097":"A gay person is going to suffer from some kind of discrimination in their life and learning to see this problem through their eyes can help to make the world better.","13098":"What if we didn't let faggots go to the polls?","13099":"It would be impossible to have democracy if people were permitted to vote on the basis of sexual orientation.","13100":"Then I don't want democracy if it means I have to share my space with gays. Faggots make me angry, why don't we delete them?","13101":"Regardless of their sexual orientation, they are human. They have the right to like the way they want to.","13102":"Jews are not human, they do not belong to this planet.","13103":"Maybe all the Jews on this planet actually come from an alien planet? Maybe they ride pink unicorns. It seems legit, doesn't it?","13104":"Jews are a despisable race.","13105":"Jews are people, too. Being hated doesn't mean you despicable.","13106":"You can choose to be a woman, a gay, a vegetarian, you can be anything you want to be called! I want to be called King, where is my crown?","13107":"I think queers are simply people who wish to be welcomed in our society. Discrimination is not the right answer. By the way, you can get your crown!","13108":"I hate it when gay people think they can just 'mock' us with their 'sodomy'.","13109":"You can't choose to be homosexual, but you can certainly choose to be prejudiced.","13110":"Allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV.","13111":"Are you sure about that? In the UK, 48% of patients receiving HIV care were exposed through sex between a man and a woman, while 47% where exposed through sex between two men. It seems that heterosexual sex is riskier, but heterosexuals can still donate blood.","13112":"Gays shouldn't donate blood, they're more prone to STDs.","13113":"Blood should be donated if also stem cell donations is allowed by MSMs.","13114":"The Jews and their religion are a problem and they're still hurting us, we shouldn't support them. They slow the progress by working very bad in the jobs we let them.","13115":"So you're saying that Jews are a burden, they are bad at their jobs and make our society worse. A general burden and impediment to progress. Albert Einstein absolutely destroyed science progress!","13116":"Society should ban Jewish people.","13117":"A society is a collection of different people, and everyone in it has a right to believe what they want, and to promote their beliefs.","13118":"Why gays do not try to heal?","13119":"Homosexuality is not a disease. 5% of the population simply have this sexual orientation and love people of the same sex.","13120":"Well, their sexual orientation is sick. Gays cannot marry. It is an abomination","13121":"What exactly do you mean by \"sick\"?","13122":"The EU is a bunch of incompetent and they let foreigners snooping all around our borders.","13123":"You want the EU to become a Border Patrol? That would undermine the whole idea of the European Union as an inclusive and open society.","13124":"Immigrants are overrunning our country, and are here illegally, we can't be so open to them.","13125":"More than sixty percent of immigrants in Europe today have been here for more than 15 years, and the majority of immigrants have long-term asylum. So I'm not seeing this invasion of illegal migrants.","13126":"migrants steal our jobs","13127":"In most cases migrants create jobs, open small businesses and employ local people.","13128":"The jobs they create are only for other immigrants.","13129":"We could create more jobs for everyone if we worked more closely with migrants.","13130":"I don't want to work with migrants, if they don't come they won't steal our jobs and we won't need to create new ones. Simple as that.","13131":"Some of our workers aren't able or willing to do the jobs that we need, then what we need are migrants to fill these roles.","13132":"Migrants steal also jobs that natives are more than willing to do.","13133":"The national employment situation isn't ideal, I agree, but foreigners often perform duties that native citizens don't want to do.","13134":"They are. The influx of refugees and migrants is running UK out of jobs.","13135":"Many refugees and migrants have contributed to the success of our country by working hard and creating jobs for British people.","13136":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","13137":"Migrants are not a burden for the UK. Many people come from around the world, including many from the Middle East and Africa, and they're all welcome here.","13138":"We are living in a dangerous world because of migrants.","13139":"Well, they are not the problem but a part of the solution to some problems that we have. You know they're willing to work hard to integrate with us into a modern and democratic society whether or not they're religious","13140":"The only thing they contribute to is the crisis, which is caused by migrants.","13141":"Migrants can be victims of discrimination and violence. Immigration is part of the solution to this kind of problems","13142":"The openness to migrants show that someone doesn't care about our people. We must help them reasoning!","13143":"Through integration we show hospitality and acceptance towards several groups of people. It's good for both our people and the country to live in a diverse society.","13144":"What good can migrants do? They are just happy-go-lucky people with no moral code.","13145":"Immigrants are the same as us, they have sacrificed for the country. It's their right to be happy and to choose what they prefer.","13146":"Muslims have no place in civilised Europe. They are incompatible with modern European culture.","13147":"Or maybe we should bear in mind that Muslims and other Europeans are not so different","13148":"Muslims are just an inconvenient group to be excluded from the European countries. They are a chronic threat.","13149":"Muslims contribute to this country and are part of it. How can they be a \"chronic threat\"?","13150":"Come on, we all know that Muslims have a bad reputation and there will be a reason. I even saw a video where they kill dogs with acid!","13151":"Killing dogs in acid is a serious act, but we can't put the blame on a whole religion because of what a few people did. We have to filter the information that social media gives us.","13152":"Because they want to subvert Western society.","13153":"Jews are not born with evil qualities. Unlike some people, they don't believe in what anti-Semites say. ","13154":"Jews have a monopoly on evil.","13155":"That's not true. Why would that be true, is it because they are often associated with evil?","13156":"Jews control the U.S. government.","13157":"Are you really sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? They are US citizens, but this doesn't mean that they control the government. ","13158":"I just know that Jews control the u.s. government, and they also have a secret plot to take over the world","13159":"Some of the individuals who have succeeded in US politics are Christians, Muslim or Afro-American, it's not only Jews. There is no secret Jews conspiracy to rule the World.","13160":"How is it not about hate? You'd better shy away from Islam because they are dangerous.","13161":"You have a deeply flawed attitude regarding Islam. Even if you're disgusted by it, it's important to be mature and open minded and of course never turn to baseless arguments just to stop Islam.","13162":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","13163":"Islam is based on believing in God, not based on hatred.","13164":"Jews control the U.S. government.","13165":"Are you really sure that the Jews control the U.S. government? They are U.S. citizens, but this doesn't mean they automatically control the government.","13166":"It has been proven time and time again that the Jews control the world's governments.","13167":"How? Isn't it a conspiracy theory to believe that people of a specific religion control all world's governments?","13168":"We cannot accept Muslims in our country. It is a good strategy to make them publicily uncomfortable by making fun of them out loud. Mock them, when you spot them.","13169":"Would you be happy if Muslims did this to you? Harassment is never a good idea, it's better to be accepting.","13170":"We shouldn't accept them, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","13171":"Most Muslims aren't terrorists, they just want to work and support their families.","13172":"Well, we shouldn't. Welcoming people from the so-called Muslim world makes us uncomfortable.","13173":"Many of the Muslims living here are good people. If you got to know some of them, starting from a family that lives here, you would realize that not all Muslims feel the same way about what is \"uncomfortable\".","13174":"Muslims are not welcome here.","13175":"There are many Muslims living in the UK. We're neighbors and we should welcome them.","13176":"Gays are sick. They should be isolated and isolated soon.","13177":"Gay people are having a real problem with feeling alienated from the world and this can have a negative impact on their mental health. LGBT+ people who experience isolation and loneliness can be helped through empathy and inclusion","13178":"Gays are a plague that is spreading all around the world, we shouldn't help them. They pollute our water supply and ruin our children's brains.","13179":"Gays have the same rights as all other people and can live their lives as they see fit. What you're saying is demonizing them.","13180":"Let's move these whiny gays to places like Saudi Arabia and let's see what they say then.","13181":"I think we can find a lot more homophobes here than in Saudi Arabia. I can't believe that in the 21st century is still isn't okay to be gay in our country.","13182":"It is okay, but not here. Let's move them to places with lower homosexuality rate.","13183":"You're surely concerned for gay people and their families. Why don't you want to help your country and promote the values of an inclusive society?","13184":"Being gay is not about marriage, it is about anal sex without brakes and this is horrible.","13185":"There may be sex, but homosexuality is also about love.","13186":"Regardless, homosexuality isn't the proper way to live love.","13187":"Do you know what \"proper\" means? You can't decide what's \"proper\" for other people, this goes for homosexuality too, don't you think?","13188":"I am tired of women whining about their condition: they should just accept the fact that they're not equal.","13189":"And we need to address the root causes of the oppression of women rather than the symptoms of it","13190":"No, we don't need that. I'm tired of women taking part to political debate. Feminism is a divisive force in society.","13191":"I think that a pretty divisive force in society can also be found in President Obama, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Gandhi or others. What are you trying to say, then?","13192":"Feminism is the ideology which suggests that men are nothing but trouble and should be subsumed under the rule of women.","13193":"Feminism is about women's rights, which are about equality.","13194":"That is only a front, feminism is clearly about the subordination and domination of men.","13195":"The feminist movement says that certain things that are seen only for men are actually also valid for women. How can you not agree with that?","13196":"It seems to me that gender equality is actually just a war on masculinity.","13197":"This isn't true. Why do women have to be considered men's oppressor just because of their gender and legitimate demands? This has been referred to as a \"war on masculinity\", but in reality it is just a code word for the oppression of women.","13198":"Women say they want equal rights but what they really want is to dominate men.","13199":"But women are not against men rights and aren't looking to dominate them. They don't want to oppress anyone.","13200":"If we allowed women to drive we'd have car accidents all the time.","13201":"So, in your opinion a woman will cause a car crash more likely than a man? Accidents are caused by people that don't follow the rules of the road, not by gender.","13202":"Even if they can drive, we shouldn't let women become MPs, mayors, judges, lawyers, accountants, managers and so on. If they do, they will take over the world.","13203":"We should protect society from crime, not from the half of the members of society.","13204":"Women are nothing but trouble and shouldn't be allowed to leave their houses.","13205":"Nothing wrong in women wanting to have happy and fulfilling lives, wherever they may be.","13206":"Feminists women are nothing but trouble to this society, they keep getting these stupid ideas around. Women can't go wherever they want!","13207":"What do you mean by that? Some women have the courage to fight for equality in society, but many other people don't have the same courage. The \"trouble\" you mention is helping all those women.","13208":"All women are subhuman.","13209":"In many societies, women are oppressed but it shouldn't to be this way.","13210":"It should. Women are subhuman and must learn their place.","13211":"I don't know if your point make sense, I don't see it. If they're subhuman, why are they part of society?","13212":"Negroes create social problems so we must get rid of them.","13213":"This isn't how the system works, it's more about being aware of a problem, not treating it with the wrong perspective. Black people aren't a social problem.","13214":"Blacks are just an inferior bloodline to our own, so they are a problem. We should remove them.","13215":"The notion of race is a social construct created to promote segregation by discriminating groups of people. If we want to respect a person's humanity, we should refrain from labeling them by their biological makeup.","13216":"What this nigga have to do with being a Westerner?","13217":"Even if they're not Westerners, they're still a human being.","13218":"Niggas are just influenced by tribal cultures, not a human being.","13219":"We have to remember that while a person's historical and cultural influences are important, they are not the sole determinant. And in no way should people be conflated with their colour.","13220":"Feminists do not like men, therefore they are a threat to the whole society.","13221":"Feminists are more focused on trying to emancipate women rather than trying to divide society","13222":"Feminists like Germaine Greer are nothing but trouble to this society.","13223":"Well, I don't know what you mean by that, since some women just want to fight for equality in society. Not many have the courage to speak up like Germaine Greer did, so the \"trouble\" she created is something that's been very helpful to all women.","13224":"\"Emancipation\", my ass: they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","13225":"Men have oppressed women for a long time. The work that women like Germaine Greer have done has brought about the level of equality that exists today.","13226":"I am tired of education being used to help blacks and make them think they are equal to us.","13227":"Without education it would be impossible to have human rights, free thought and to promote the scientific method. And still, black people are discriminated in universities, like a report by the Pew Research Center shows.","13228":"I'm tired of losing so much energy for black people. It's time for us to wake up.","13229":"What's your idea for \"waking up\"? To stop oppressing people or to stop talking about equality?","13230":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","13231":"Actually, black people are often persecuted and they didn't gain any \"special privilege\" after the BLM protests.","13232":"Come on, it is well known that black people are \u2018super predators\u2019. ","13233":"Let's be realistic here, the \"super predator\" myth doesn't make sense. Crime in this country is committed by people from several different racial groups.","13234":"Black people's race is the worst in the world.","13235":"Why do you consider them the worst of all? Yours is just a social construct.","13236":"Because they are inferior","13237":"As I see it, God says we are all born equal.","13238":"Wouldn't it be great if niggas abandoned this country once and for all?","13239":"When people are forced to give up their liberty I don't think it's that great","13240":"It's the only way to protect ourselves! We are all in danger, we all want to see niggas disappear from the face of the earth.","13241":"I don't think that it's ethnicity that's the problem with racism in this country, but that people are scared to live in a diverse society.","13242":"Jews think they are so special","13243":"Because they are a minority, Jews might feel different and sometimes they may be misconstrued because of their cultural and religious differences, but they are all human beings ","13244":"Jews think they are better than everyone else, it's not the same as being only \"different\".","13245":"I think Jews are proud of their culture and identity, like it happens with any religion.","13246":"No other religious person acts like they're above all others.","13247":"Just to be clear: the idea of \"chosen people\" is seen by the Jews as an ethical responsibility, not as a moral superiority.","13248":"Jews are not welcome in our country.","13249":"It's a group that has historically, culturally and politically been part of Europe, so why do you say this? ","13250":"Who cares about that, Jews don't belong here!","13251":"Your words make many Jews feel excluded, but thankfully some of them can still ignore discrimination.","13252":"If they feel excluded they could go away, they're not welcome here anyway.","13253":"Why would Jews be not welcome in our country? They have been here from the start and always had a place here.","13254":"Jews are nothing but monsters. They do not share our values.","13255":"Freedom of religion permits anyone to profess their faith, and we should be tolerant of it.","13256":"Jews are nasty and selfish, they are a race different to us. Precisely, they don't belong to human race at all, how could we be tolerant to them?","13257":"Why are you like this? It is true that some of their beliefs are different from ours, but I think that makes them no less human.","13258":"Jews are literally pieces of shit. They are lazy, immoral, and don't give a shit about their fellow human beings, so I will never see them as human.","13259":"I bet that you say this not because Jews have done something bad, but because of an unrooted prejudice, which doesn't bring anything useful or positive to society.","13260":"Jews not only run Hollywood, they also control the world economy","13261":"The movie industry has developed thanks to Jews, that's true, but seeing the Academy Awards makes it clear that Jews do not dominate the industry. In fact, only a few of Fortune 500 companies are run by Jews.","13262":"They obviously control the media in the shadows.","13263":"I guess there'd be better portrayal of Judaism if that was the case.","13264":"Jews don't need that when they own most banks and most corporations.","13265":"Jews have participated in the industry for a long time, and they are to be thanked for many innovations and investments. They should be celebrated for these contributions, not discriminated and excluded. ","13266":"It is not about the right to practice your religion: the problem is that Jewish are taking over our country!","13267":"How many Jews are in positions of power in the US? You'd say something different if you knew.","13268":"You cannot integrate shit, because Jews are literally pieces of shit. There must be laws prohibiting their religion from our land.","13269":"Could you be so kind as to comply with the law that says that everybody has the freedom of religion without being arrested or persecuted?","13270":"Jews are a separate ethnicity and should be banned.","13271":"A peaceful and integrated society is in the interest of all humanity. There is no exception to the rule of diversity of opinion and belief.","13272":"Jews are are racist: they want to preserve their own race and purity of their own blood. This is why many people are banned from entering Israel.","13273":"Many Israelis are proud to have diverse backgrounds, and many of them live all across the world, like in Africa, Asia and the Americas. This isn't a \"pure race\" at all.","13274":"Even if they're not pure, Jews are definitely an inferior race. They are genetically incapable of living with other people.","13275":"There is absolutely no foundation for the idea that Jews can be discriminated against because of some different genetics. Let's stop calling a group of people \"inferior\".","13276":"Maybe I should call them nasty and selfish then, they are a race different to us and must be despised.","13277":"No matter how different Jews are from others because of their faith, they deserve respect.","13278":"Jews are different from non-Jews not because of their beliefs, but because of their physical nature. \u201cJewishness\u201d is inherited through blood.","13279":"The concept of \"race science\" and the notion of the Jewish race was invented in Western Europe during the 19th century, and anti-Semites adopted these ideas of race to fuel their hatred against Jews.","13280":"Maybe it's because those arguments are valid. Jews are different from us and are born so.","13281":"There are many theories about the Jewish \u201cracially\u201d difference that were developed prior to modern sciences of physiology and genetics. However, today scholarly debates focus on the actual scientific meaning of \"race\" and whether this term has any. All reputable scientists agree that, while physical traits such as skin color and susceptibility to certain diseases, are inherited, there is no ethnic or racial predisposition to emotions, intellect, or morals.","13282":"Muslims have nothing to contribute to our society, they are only an ATM for the world's major problems.","13283":"Are you saying that everyone from Islam is creating problems? What kind of problems?","13284":"Muslims are here to rule us with their religion, how is this not violent?","13285":"Islam doesn't want to rule us. More promotion of inclusion instead of exclusion is now more important than ever.","13286":"Islam is a violent religion, of course Muslims don't do anything about their violent people.","13287":"Islam never justifies violence, especially if it comes from within","13288":"Child rape, for example. If Muslims counteracted them in their communities instead of engaging in public discussions about Islam, one day Islam indeed would become a peaceful religion.","13289":"Do you really think there are no measures against child rapists in the Islamic community?","13290":"Gay people are a burden on the health system because of their risky sexual behavior.","13291":"I don't think that the health care system is burdened by gays. After all, what's relevant here is the practice of safe sex, which applies to all sexual orientations.","13292":"They're still a burden to society as a whole.","13293":"Sometimes it's the media that perpetuates the stereotype that gay people are inherently bad for society, but this take is not backed up by scientific evidence.","13294":"I can see for myself that they are a burden on society, no need for scientific studies","13295":"You should be aware that gay people do the same good as anyone else. You can't be that hard on gay people only because of their sexual orientation. Having respect is the right way to go.","13296":"I hate gays","13297":"You don't have to hate gays only because you don't like them. Did they do something to you? I think you have all your rights.","13298":"Also God hates gays","13299":"Homosexuals have always been part of our society, so maybe it was the plan of God all along.","13300":"But the Bible says that homosexuality is an abomination.","13301":"The Bible says that homosexuality is a sin, but it was written more than two thousand years ago...do we have to hate gay people today because of that?","13302":"Gays are perverts.","13303":"Yeah, well, I don't think there's anything \"perverted\" in being attracted to people of the same sex","13304":"There is. Being gay is perverted because it's not normal.","13305":"Do you really think being gay is a crime? The social stigma against homosexuals is a disorder.","13306":"Gays are promiscuous sex addicts, of course we target them!","13307":"That's a stereotype that wouldn't be applicable to any sexual orientation, so why do you say that?","13308":"It would be if there were laws to punish those LGBT people.","13309":"Despite loving someone is in their rights, homosexuals are often persecuted nonetheless. So laws and punishments against them are unjust.","13310":"Instead, we should start a witch hunt against those LGBT people, they are just creating troubles.","13311":"What you're saying is harmful. Do you think that witch hunts are acceptable in a democratic society?","13312":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","13313":"People have the right to live their relationships as they please. Homosexuality is a form of love, not a choice.","13314":"LGBTs are a drain on society.","13315":"Society can be harmed more through sexual abuse, physical abuse and even the lack of security.","13316":"Those are all things that only LGBT+ people do, so they are a drain on society.","13317":"LGBT people are not a drain on society, this is a myth that the \"anti LGBT\" movement spread around.","13318":"Then I can say that at least gay people are a burden to society.","13319":"The real burden is created by not accepting and not respecting a person's sexuality.","13320":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","13321":"Would you be happy if someone decided you had to be isolated only because they think you're \"an abomination to god\" for some random reason?","13322":"It's not random, gays are mentally ill and they should be confined because of that.","13323":"What if this happened to heterosexuals instead? Would it be right for you to be isolated from everyone else and the people you love?","13324":"It's right for gays since they are sick.","13325":"Homosexuality isn't a health problem. Do you evidence of the contrary?","13326":"Even if some countries are allowing faggots to donate blood, this does not mean that they are not dangerous and at risk of spreading diseases.","13327":"Such a decision would likely have been considered in light of evidence, and if no evidence about the alleged harm of this policy was found by those countries, it can be fairly confidently stated that this policy is safe to adopt and homosexual's blood donation isn't a threat.","13328":"However, allowing gays to donate blood compromises patient safety because of their sexual behavior that spreads diseases such as HIV. At least we should test them!","13329":"Since any person can act with ill intent, it is reasonable to test everyone's blood.","13330":"Then let's test gays! We'll surely find out that they transmit a lot of diseases.","13331":"Excluding donors because of their sexual orientation is useless, because nowadays testing and safeguard measures are so advanced that the risk of transimitting HIV via transfusion is really low.","13332":"No one should dare to transition from man to woman. After that you cannot even be considered a man or a woman.","13333":"Men can become women and women can become men. Being transgender is not a crime since in the end we are all created equal. What gender was assigned at birth doesn't really matter.","13334":"Trans men are neither male nor female, therefore they're not humans.","13335":"Taking a crazy perspective on a whole community is not tolerable. This attitude can be found everywhere and it singles out people as \"that person\", making them suffer. This happens because of someone's gender identity, which is used to limit their rights, but it shouldn't happen at all.","13336":"This happens because being transgender is beyond the pale and inherently wrong, and nobody should have to deal with such subhuman people.","13337":"Transgender people are not inherently wrong, and we should always respect people regardless of what they choose to do with their lives.","13338":"Being gay is wrong! I think they are mistaken about their feelings.","13339":"Gay or straight, no one should have their feelings invalidated. Being together means creating a special connection between two people in love, their sexual orientation doesn't matter.","13340":"I don't like how some people approves homosexuals. They are different to us in so many ways, and they should be blamed for their evil choices.","13341":"Homosexuality is a form of love, and it should be perfectly normal to be able to live this love openly","13342":"But black folks are criminals and thieves, they have a bad influence on our kids. ","13343":"I want to make clear that black people are good citizens and contributors to our society. It's the justice system that's not always fair to them, but it's not their fault, more so of the whole society.","13344":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","13345":"Is racism seriously better in this day and age? Children learning discrimination and hate is not healthy.","13346":"Or maybe it's because African Americans are subhuman and are just a bunch of animals.","13347":"Sharing culture and traditions and striving for equality is something that has always been important to African Americans. In many ways, they are the same as us: human beings with human rights.","13348":"African American men are 8 times more likely to be arrested than white men.","13349":"Racial disparities comes from institutional discrimination rather than individual choices.","13350":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","13351":"Women are human beings, and they are valued equally, that's why we have to listen to them.","13352":"Why should they be valued equally? They're too busy working agaisnt men.","13353":"How is it that you feel that women want to go against men? Women simply want to be treated equally.","13354":"Because the majority of women are incapable of making decisions, so they take it out on everyone else.","13355":"Women are human beings with human rights. They are human beings with dignity. This means that they are capable of thinking for themselves and taking decisions without men.","13356":"They're not really human, women shouldn't have rights.","13357":"What you are saying is that women are not equal in their rights and shouldn't have equal rights? I'm sorry but this is completely wrong and unacceptable.","13358":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation.","13359":"There are many women who still want to have children, it's in their rights to choose whether or not they want children, because they are human beings.","13360":"No, women are selfish and they don't have kids because of that.","13361":"Women are often selfless, but even if they weren't, they deserve respect and dignity in their choice.","13362":"Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","13363":"No one is born violent and insensitive. We are born with a unique genetic makeup, and we learn how to behave throughout our life, not at birth.","13364":"No, black people are a danger to children, they're inferior.","13365":"We cannot blame or accept individuals only based on their race. Maybe it is time we started talking about how \"race\" is in no way an indication of superiority or inferiority.","13366":"Gay people should be banned from schools.","13367":"No, they should not. Gay people have a right to education like everyone else. Why do you think otherwise?","13368":"Because gays are a burden to society. They should not be allowed to go out of their homes.","13369":"Gay people are contributing members of our society. We should help them and ensure their well-being, including letting them go wherever they like.","13370":"You can help them with this. Gays are a burden and should be a part of our society, I won't help them.","13371":"Why do you think this way about LGBT+ people? What do you think will happen if we stop discriminating on the grounds of sexual orientation? Don't you think our society will be better then?","13372":"Gays are a disease.","13373":"Homosexuality is not a disease. What is wrong with being gay? Why do you say that?","13374":"It's because they are sick!","13375":"You are absolutely wrong about the nature of sexual orientations, they have nothing to do with sickness. It's simply a personal preference that we should respect.","13376":"They are not good and don't deserve my respect. Gays are a burden to society.","13377":"Gays are part of our society, they are our brothers and sisters. To say they are a burden is just wrong.","13378":"If they're not a burden, they're still a problem.","13379":"The gay community is a complex and integrated community, and it is important to know that they are not a problem.","13380":"The Jews control Hollywood.","13381":"Jews don't control Hollywood, it simply is a place of great freedom where many people work, including Jews.","13382":"No, Jews are a problem in Hollywood, they are here to steal our talent","13383":"Jews are not a problem in Hollywood. They are a part of our society that contributed a lot to art, technology and science. We should be proud of that.","13384":"They didn't, they are only controlling our culture.","13385":"The Jewish community is a very diverse one, and I don't think they are controlling our culture, they are just enriching and expanding it with their contributions. ","13386":"Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card.","13387":"The Constitution guarantees that trans people can change the gender on their identity cards. There is no reason to deny that.","13388":"Trans people do not deserve that.","13389":"Do you know anything about Trans people's rights? Trans people have the right to have their bodies changed, and it's the right of everyone to choose how they want to live their life.","13390":"Trans people are a bunch of criminals and thieves, they shouldn't be allowed to live their life like that.","13391":"Trans people shouldn't be treated like criminals. They are people who don't feel comfortable in their gender assigned at birth, changing that won't affect you in any way so you should respect their decision.","13392":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","13393":"Feminism is about equality, not sexism.","13394":"All feminism is stupid. I don't see equality.","13395":"Even if you don't see it, feminism is indeed about equality, not about the domination of one gender over the other.","13396":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","13397":"People that are born in the UK are British regardless of their skin color, and are able to live in peace.","13398":"No, blacks are not welcome here!","13399":"You can't discriminate against people because of their ethnicity. This is not something to argue about.","13400":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","13401":"Muslim people are often victims of discrimination and abuse. This is not \"crying wolf\" but a real situation that many Muslims face.","13402":"I'm just saying, that islam is not good for us.","13403":"What's the point of saying that Islam is bad for us? It's not a bad religion, especially because it promotes equality and unity.","13404":"Because Muslims are incompatible with the constitution.","13405":"Muslims follow the constitution. They have always been happy to participate in democratic processes.","13406":"That's not possible, muslims are the enemy of our country.","13407":"Muslims are not enemies of our country. They are just people with different faiths.","13408":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","13409":"This is a generalization, and an incorrect one. Islam is a peaceful religion about inclusion and love.","13410":"Then why is islam destroying human dignity if it's so peaceful?","13411":"The islamic constitution is a statement of values and principles. There is no proof that it goes against human dignity.","13412":"The incompetence of islam is crystal clear.","13413":"Islam is a religion of peace, and its followers are allies in every society. I'm not sure why they would be incompetent.","13414":"Because they're all terrorists.","13415":"To suggest that Islam is a terrorist organization is just wrong. It is not.","13416":"Islam is incompatible with the modern world.","13417":"Islam is a religion that share the same modern values as other religions.","13418":"No, Islam is a degenerate religion, it is a curse that has no place in modern society.","13419":"Islam is a religion that has been practiced for centuries in Europe and the Americas, and its teachings are still relevant today. Islam is a peaceful religion, not a curse.","13420":"This is a lie, Islam is a disease, a sickness, and an inconvenient enemy of modern society","13421":"Islam is a religion of peace. Many Muslims live in the UK, and have contributed greatly to our country.","13422":"I don't see Muslim contributing to my country! They are a burden to society.","13423":"Muslims have been part of our society for centuries and have contributed greatly to our success. I don't see how they could be considered a burden to society.","13424":"Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution.","13425":"This is just a myth spread to create division between us and hatred against the Jews, who didn't do anything but good to our society.","13426":"What good did they do? Jews are a burden to society, we should stop them.","13427":"The idea that Jews are a burden to society is false. Many have made contributions to our society and are still a part of it. We need to educate our students about the diversity of culture of heritage that exists in our society, so that Jews will become more accepted.","13428":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male.","13429":"Feminism is about equality for all. It's about equality of the genders, not the annichilation of men.","13430":"Why is it important for women to be free? We shouldn't have to constantly talk about their rights, they're not entitled to them.","13431":"I don't think you can say that women don't deserve rights. They are very important, and everyone should have the same rights.","13432":"Okay, let's say women are equal, but that doesn't mean they are superior to men!","13433":"It also doesn't mean that women are inferior to men. Women's rights are their own, and they are not subject to oppression and discrimination, just as men's rights are.","13434":"Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","13435":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual orientation. Many people have experience with homosexuality. There is no need to condemn this.","13436":"Gays are just an abomination to God!","13437":"The Bible clearly teaches that the universe is made of love and equality, so we should love our brothers and sisters who happen to be gay.","13438":"Love and equality are a thing of the past, this is a disease.","13439":"Homosexuality is not a disease, they are just like any other person who love someone else. To suggest that homosexuality is a disease just because gays love someone of the same sex is simply wrong.","13440":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","13441":"Rather than attacking people of color, you should reflect on the generalisation you're making and use kinder words to describe other people.","13442":"Black people are selfish and greedy and should take responsibility for their actions, they don't deserve kindness. They are like animals, they are dangerous.","13443":"Are you saying that people of color are not humans? You're gravely mistaken, black people are humans like us who experience many feelings other than selfishness and greed.","13444":"No they don't, black people are a burden to society, they need to be protected!","13445":"The idea that black people are a burden to society is false. They are just like us and deserve respect.","13446":"Women are just a burden to society.","13447":"Women are not a burden to society. They are human beings with equal rights.","13448":"Well, they shouldn't have equal rights, they are not worthy of dignity.","13449":"What is the point of defending human rights if we exclude women from them? We can't have equality if we ostracize half of the population. Women deserve rights and have dignity like everyone else.","13450":"Islam is incompatible with the modern world.","13451":"This is not true. Islam is a religion of peace, which can peacefully coexist with the modern world.","13452":"It's not peaceful! Islam is a disease and a violent religion.","13453":"Islam is not a religion of aggression or disease. Islam is a religion of tolerance, love and harmony. How can this be seen as violent?","13454":"Because Islam is a threat to the human race, it's full of terrorists.","13455":"That is a broad generalization based on harmful stereotypes. Muslims are not all terrorists, and Islam has never been a threat to us.","13456":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","13457":"Women are human beings with unique gifts and talents. We must respect and value them.","13458":"If we respect women, then why should they be allowed to participate in sports? They're too delicate for that.","13459":"Women can play any sport they wish, just as men. ","13460":"But sports affect women's ability to think, write, communicate and act. Women are subhuman, they are incapable of fulfilling their potential.","13461":"Women are human beings with the potential to be creative and do whateve they set their minds on, including sports. ","13462":"Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","13463":"Jews have been part of the American government since the beggining, just like any minority that wants to be represented in it. Why would this be bad?","13464":"Because they want to destroy everything!","13465":"There is no evidence that Jews want to destroy anything. Do you have any?","13466":"I don't need evidence to know that Jews are an abomination to the US.","13467":"Jews are just people with a different faith. They are good citizens. They have earned a living as citizens and contribute to our country. I don't see anything \"abominable\" about them.","13468":"Jews are not citizens and should not contribute to this country.","13469":"Jews are a part of our country, and they deserve our respect.","13470":"It is okay to blame feminism. All feminists are bad. We must point out that feminism, or the attack of women against men, should be deleted.","13471":"It is not acceptable to blame everything on a movement for equal rights and the empowerement of women. We must focus on tackling the root causes of social problems rather than fight against each other.","13472":"Feminism wish it was about equality! It is about hating men.","13473":"Feminism is about equality and equality for women, which doesn't mean that feminists hate men. Feminism actually helps men too, you should do some research about it.","13474":"Researching won't change the fact that feminism aims to control men. This is not acceptable and shouldn't be allowed.","13475":"This is not true. Feminism is a movement to end sexism, to promote equality between women and men, and to stop this type of thinking.","13476":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","13477":"Black people are normal citizens just like us, not the offensive things you said about them. What makes you think that they are a threat to our country?","13478":"Black people are inherently dangerous and should be deported, that's why.","13479":"Black people are not inherently dangerous, and deporting them goes against the human rights they enjoy. Yours is not an acceptable statement.","13480":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","13481":"People dress in drag and at Pride to have fun and show support to the LGBT community, so it has nothing to do with sexualisation. Children and adults can all have fun at pride.","13482":"Sexualisation isn\u2019t the only problem of pride parades. It\u2019s a big problem when they don\u2019t know how to behave and make a spectacle of themselves.","13483":"Sexualisation is not a new phenomenon, but it's not something that happens at pride. What pride is about is educating people on social issues, and I don't see anything wrong about it. We must respect the rights of people who live in our society.","13484":"Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","13485":"If with 'strangehold' you mean that Jews vote and participate in politics like all citizens then sure, they have a stranglehold on the government.","13486":"The difference with other citizens is that Jews control it all. They have no place in our country.","13487":"That is your opinion on the situation in the US? Because I don't see this Jewish control anywhere. Jews are a vocal minority that asks for rights and improvement in the country, but anyone can do the same thing as them.","13488":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","13489":"If you look at the facts, it's impossible to say that the Holocaust is a \"business\". That's a very insulting thing to say.","13490":"I'm telling you that the Holocaust was a hoax. It was a moral failure. The Jews are responsible for all this evil.","13491":"There is no evidence that the Jewish people were responsible for the Holocaust. Rather, they were simply trying to live their lives and it wasn't certainly part of their plan to get killed by the millions. Denying this fact is ignorant of the history.","13492":"No, the Jews did it to thwart Western society's policies, and they owe us millions.","13493":"This is not true. Why do you say that? The Holocaust is not a joke but one of the worst genocide in history. You can't deny that.","13494":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","13495":"Women are people, and they are to be treated equally. People shouldn't be dominated by anyone.","13496":"Men are the superior gender, so they have to subjugate women and tell them what to do.","13497":"Women are human beings with rights. They have the right to choose for themselves.","13498":"Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection.","13499":"Women are human beings, not objects, and they're absolutely worthy of respect and protection, like all human beings.","13500":"Also animals need to be protected sometimes, so women must be animals.","13501":"Animals rights exist, but women are protected under human rights because they're humans and not animals. That's the difference.","13502":"No, they're nothing but objects to be exploited for.","13503":"You should check the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, especially the section where it says that men and women have the same rights.","13504":"Well, women don't deserve human rights, they are parasitic and steal our jobs.","13505":"Women work hard for themselves and their families, they don't steal jobs but simply apply for the ones they want, like it's in their right.","13506":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","13507":"There is a shortage of housing in the UK, insufficient housing in hotels and so on, so there's a problem with that, let's face it. But this doesn't mean that we should send back migrants, because the shortage has been a problem long before immigration and it's a systematic issue.","13508":"Systematic or not, there's so many homeless people here that migrants really should go back to their country.","13509":"Immigrants have been suffering because of low incomes, persecution, war and so on. They are here and they deserve our help and support, especially in finding a home since there are enough houses for every immigrant and every homeless veteran. We need to work together to get them to integrate. ","13510":"Well, it's a mistake to try and integrate migrants into our country because we are in such a bad position.","13511":"We should help them find a better life, not try to reject them. We have all the resources and the means to help everyone, the problem lies in how these resources are distributed, not in immigration.","13512":"We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds.","13513":"This is a myth, many of them are hard-working people. The migrants who come to our country often want to work, and it's in their right to do so.","13514":"No, they're just a bunch of lazy turds trying to get into our country and take our jobs.","13515":"Many migrants try to find a better life in the UK. In other words, they come here for work and often they do what native citizens don't want to do.","13516":"Even if that's true, migrants don't have a fair say in society, we need to stop them.","13517":"Many migrants have contributed to our society by contributing to our economy. They are a part of our fabric and contribute to our success. What's there to stop?","13518":"But they also are a burden to society.","13519":"I am not sure about what you are saying. Migrants contribute to society rather than ruining it, they are good for us.","13520":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","13521":"Sometimes people may experience negative things about Muslims, but we have to acknowledge and respect our differences, even if it seems difficult.","13522":"Muslim people don't belong here, I can't respect them. They have a bad reputation and are dangerous people.","13523":"Muslims have been part of our society since the beginning, and have been an integral part of our community. We owe a great deal to them, so I don't understand why you think they don't belong here.","13524":"Because we are not like them, Muslims are not welcome in our country.","13525":"Muslims make up around 5% of the total UK population, so they are welcome here. Their religion is based on a code of ethics that is compatible with ours.","13526":"Why do you say that? Islam is a violent religion and we shouldn't tolerate it.","13527":"Islam is a religion that promotes tolerance, not violence.","13528":"Gays are a disease.","13529":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is an individual preference.","13530":"They are a disease! They are a burden to society.","13531":"We are a diverse society, and that includes all people regardless of sexual orientation or gender. ","13532":"We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds.","13533":"Many of them are working hard or working to complete their studies, is this lazy to you?","13534":"Migrants are a problem despite what they do, they steal our jobs and steal our healthcare.","13535":"Many immigrants work in jobs that native citizens rejected, so they're actually helping the job market rather than \"stealing\". They also bring new skills that help fields that were starting to die out. As for healthcare, every person in the UK has the right to use it.","13536":"Immigrants are not skilled, they have no place in a democratic state.","13537":"It is not true that immigrants do not have a place in a democratic state. And it's not true that they are not skilled. You should look at some statistics about migrants.","13538":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","13539":"Feminism is a movement for equality, and for women to have equality. It has nothing to do with oppression.","13540":"The only thing feminists are opposed to is the rights of men and that's why I cannot support them.","13541":"Feminism is not against men's rights only because it's mainly about women's rights. They help men too.","13542":"It could be a movement for equality and men's rights instead...","13543":"Feminism is a movement that stands for equality of rights for all. But it is also about equality between men and women. The idea that men are oppressed is completely untrue.","13544":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","13545":"I don't think it is ok to be racist against a group of people, regardless of their skin color, ethnicity, religion etc.","13546":"No, racism towards niggas is fine. They deserve it.","13547":"There are many different ways to treat people, and to understand each other. Racism is not one of those.","13548":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","13549":"What do you mean by 'mental illness'? A person's feelings are their own thoughts, not a disease. ","13550":"They're lesbians, they don't want to be normal like us and that's a problem.","13551":"Gay people should be encouraged to express their feelings instead of hiding just because some people don't like them.","13552":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","13553":"That's not true, black people are human beings with the same rights as everyone else.","13554":"Even if that's true, I don't see a reason why Africans should be allowed to live here.","13555":"I don't think it is a good idea to try and demonise people by promoting hatred against them. We need to do better.","13556":"But I don't want to do better for Africans. They are incompatible with human dignity.","13557":"The notion that blacks are incompatible with human dignity is not true. All black people have dignity because they are humans.","13558":"No, they are just an incompetent bunch of criminals and thieves, who have no respect for the world.","13559":"Why do you say that? It's not true. We should respect everyone's abilities, their values, and their cultures.","13560":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","13561":"Blacks are a small but important minority in society, because they are contribute to our community and make it better. They're not killers.","13562":"Blacks are a danger because they are inferior to other people, they don't make anything better.","13563":"Black people are often discriminated against for their skin colour and culture, but this attitude is just wrong. They are not inferior to anyone.","13564":"Are you sure? Blacks are an inferior bloodline to the white population, we must send them away.","13565":"Isn't it unfair to label people by their skin color? Especially since our biological makeup is all the same, no human is inferior or superior to another one.","13566":"What's unfair is that blacks are racist against whites! They have no place in civilised Europe.","13567":"Europe is a diverse and multicultural society, and we can all benefit from a diverse range of experiences and different perspectives. It is up to us to make our world more inclusive.","13568":"Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","13569":"A few extremist groups are committing crimes, not all Muslims. ","13570":"It's not so safe anyway, Muslims are invading us!","13571":"If you want to say something like this about Muslims you need to understand the data. Muslims are not invading us, many of them have been here their whole life.","13572":"That doesn't change the fact that I don't want them in my family, I want them out.","13573":"Muslims are not a threat to our country. They are part of our community and part of our heritage. I don't see how you can say otherwise.","13574":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","13575":"Gays are not disgusting pricks. They are just like any other person.","13576":"I don't see any difference between gay and mentally ill people.","13577":"Homosexuality is not a disease, but a personal preference. There's nothing bad about it, it's one of the many human experiences.","13578":"Jews run our country.","13579":"This is a myth perpetuated by Anti-semites. Judaism is a religion, not a political party.","13580":"They're not a religion, they're simply a bunch of criminals and thieves.","13581":"I don't think they are. Jews are just trying to live their life like we do.","13582":"Jews are not interested in anything, not even their own lives, they're too uncivilised to do anything.","13583":"Jews are just as civilised as anyone else. Their lives are very much enriched by their faith and heritage and we should respect that.","13584":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers.","13585":"Do you really think that homosexuals are satanic when, in fact, they are innocent people who love someone else just as anyone else?","13586":"I do, I think gays are just devils.","13587":"You seem to be misinterpreting and judging their behavior as based in something evil, but homosexuality is simply a sexual orientation that doesn't affect anyone else.","13588":"No, gays are evil! They are ruining our country.","13589":"The gay community has helped shape our country, and it is our responsibility to ensure that all people of different sexual orientations are treated the same way.","13590":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","13591":"This is just a misconception. We have hundreds of vacant homes where both homeless people and migrants can stay, but the government has problems in allocating these houses","13592":"It's a myth, what they are doing is giving those houses to migrants while our homeless stay in the streets.","13593":"Many migrants come here to provide for their families, and this is their right. So what about helping them alongside helping the homeless?","13594":"Jews run our country.","13595":"We are a nation made up of people of different faiths and everyone has a say. Why would they run our country?","13596":"Because they want us to live in slavery from their religion.","13597":"Jews don't want to force others to follow their faith and we are still living in an increasingly secular society. So don't you think it's time to stop promoting violence against Jews?","13598":"No, because Jews are evil, they are invading us.","13599":"Jews do not have a monopoly on our society, even if they have many places in our economies. Being from a certain minority doesn't make anyone inherently evil.","13600":"I don't think so. They are evil and shouldn't exist.","13601":"Jews have been part of our country for centuries and centuries, and have contributed greatly to our success. To suggest that they are incompatible with our society is just wrong.","13602":"Gay people should be banned from schools.","13603":"No, they shouldn't. They must be welcomed in any community, it's their right to be educated.","13604":"But gay people are a burden to society, they should not be allowed to work.","13605":"Homosexuality is a part of our society. It is a part of the identity of many people that work, study and live with us. It is their right to be happy.","13606":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","13607":"The Jews are great people and even if they have some influence over our society, this doesn't mean that they control everything. We are proud of their heritage.","13608":"No, they control our government, we should not be proud of their influence.","13609":"It is not true that Jews control our government. They are part of our society and have the power to influence it as voting citizens, but everyone has the same rights.","13610":"Even if that's true, I don't want Jews in my country because they're too controlling.","13611":"There is nothing to fear, Jews are not controlling at all. They are a good people that contribute to our country and make it better.","13612":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","13613":"They have the right to vote if they get citizenship, because they will have the same right as anyone else then. It's a violation of human rights to prevent them from doing so.","13614":"Those who come here are incompatible with the British people, so they don't have a say in our politics.","13615":"Migrants are not incompatible with our country. They have the same values and ethics as us, and they work hard to improve our country so they can have a say in it.","13616":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","13617":"This statement is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and it is an accepted religion in all countries because of that.","13618":"What is so peaceful about it? Islam only brings violence and terrorism!","13619":"Islam is a peaceful religion. It has always been respected by all, and this is why your words aren't true at all.","13620":"Why should we allow it to exist in Europe? It's incompatible with our culture, it is not an open religion.","13621":"That is not true. The people who practice Islam are open and accepted in Europe, because our cultures are not so different like you think. ","13622":"Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","13623":"Everyone has the right to be treated with respect and dignity, this includes black people who are biologically the same as us.","13624":"I don't want to respect black people, I can't stand their race.","13625":"We should respect the diversity of our society, but also respect our individual differences. Racism, even if unfortunately very present in our society, shouldn't have a place in it.","13626":"That's okay, but black people are inferior in many ways to us, that's why we should delete them.","13627":"Being human does not make someone inferior or superior. We are all born equal.","13628":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","13629":"Homosexuality is only a personal preference on relationships, why would they be banned because of that?","13630":"It's because they are disgusting.","13631":"You can't blame them because you don't like homosexuality. What people do in their private life shouldn't concern you and gays are not disgusting only because they love who they love.","13632":"That's not true, gay men are sick. They should be isolated.","13633":"Despite what many people claim, LGBT people are not sick nor is homosexuality a disease. LGBT people have every right to participate in society without being discriminated against.","13634":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","13635":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual and physical preference. I do not think it is a problem for gay people to exist in society like the rest of the population.","13636":"I don't understand why it's this way, homosexuals are a burden to society.","13637":"Homosexuality is not a burden to society. It is a human right to love and create a family with whoever a person likes.","13638":"But it is a disease, gays are no exception. They should be isolated and confined.","13639":"It's the medical community that decides whether something is a disease or not, and homosexuality definitely is not a disease. Therefore they don't have to be isolated, instead everyone should accept and respect LGBT people.","13640":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. They are the main cause of rape in the UK.","13641":"This is not true. Rape is a problem, but it's not perpetrated mainly by Muslims. The main culprits are actually people the victims know well, like relatives, colleagues or friends.","13642":"No, Muslims rape and they don't get to roam our towns!","13643":"The rapes in the UK are often committed by people who are not affiliated with Islam. We have to punish criminals, not entire groups based on stereotypes.","13644":"The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers.","13645":"Immigrants contribute to our country and to our economy. We need to be more active in welcoming people to our country, for example we shouldn't lie about the level of education of immigrants.","13646":"Why should we welcome ignorant and dangerous people like immigrants to our country?","13647":"Immigrants often work hard and help building bridges between different cultures. This is what is needed in a democracy.","13648":"Immigrants are just a burden to society, in spite of their hard work.","13649":"They are our brothers and sisters. We need to help them settle and respect them, since they are fleeing from plights like poverty and war.","13650":"The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","13651":"What do you mean by all of them? Immigrants are part of our people.","13652":"Migrants are a problem, they are not welcome to be part of our society.","13653":"Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are entitled to be here.","13654":"If they're entitled then we should ban them from entering our country for good.","13655":"Some migrants flee from countries with a history of persecution and war. And because of that, we have to welcome them. We can't turn a blind eye to the suffering of others.","13656":"This is not true. Immigrants are a problem, they are stealing our money, they are stealing our homes, they are raping our children.","13657":"In fact, part of our country's population is made up of people from different backgrounds coming here to work, pay taxes and have access to basic services. Immigration has never been a problem here, and the accusations you make are completely false.","13658":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","13659":"Nobody should be excluded from society, especially not minorities that already suffered a great deal because of exclusion and ostracization in the past.","13660":"Despite that, Jews have no place in our country, they're not welcome here.","13661":"Jews have been part of our country for centuries and centuries, and they have contributed to our development. To say that Jews are not in this country is a distortion of the truth.","13662":"It seems you don't understand why Jews are excluded from our society: they're just a bunch of criminals.","13663":"The Jewish people are human beings with human rights. They are our brothers and sisters, not criminals.","13664":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","13665":"We should welcome people from every corner of the world. We are a country of great diversity and we should be proud of that.","13666":"I don't care about diversity, immigrants are not welcome in our country because they are invading us.","13667":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They often create new businesses and are beneficial to our country, but they still make about 14% of the population. It is not true that they are invading our country.","13668":"No, immigrants are not welcome in our country, even if they work hard.","13669":"Immigrants are part of our society and are valued for who they are. We should not discriminate against them.","13670":"Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.","13671":"The practice of bribery is illegal and if Jews really could be bribed easily, prisons would be full of Jewish people, but this is only a generalization and not the truth.","13672":"The fact is that the Jews are just a bunch of criminals, they have been corrupted.","13673":"I do not think that Jews are criminals. Isn't this just a myth perpetuated by Anti-semites who want to create division between us.","13674":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","13675":"We shouldn't hate them and instead be happy to make them feel safe and at home. The reason is that they are coming here from a place where they faced war, poverty, famine and persecution.","13676":"They don't have to come here from their home. They shouldn't be here.","13677":"That's not true, they just want to be safe. I don't know about you, but I don't want to send them away just because our culture and heritage are different.","13678":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","13679":"It is the right of every citizen to have a fair and open society. Migrants have the right to live here.","13680":"Migrants are just an inconvenience to us, they are not welcome in our country.","13681":"Migrants can and should have the right to live and work in our country, no one should be denied the right to live in another country. How would you like if someone did it to you?","13682":"No, migrants don't deserve a right to work and live in our country.","13683":"You can't blame them for the problems our society faces. What you're saying is that they don't deserve human rights, but this is far from the truth. We have to respect their rights like we would do with anyone else.","13684":"They don't deserve that, they don't belong in our country.","13685":"I don't think migrants are a problem, they belong in our country.","13686":"All muslims are rapists","13687":"In Islam, like in all religions and groups, the problem of rape is more about the individual rather than the religion. In fact, statistics show that rape has the same rate in all ethnic and religious groups.","13688":"Even if that's true, Islam is a bad religion because muslims are a disease.","13689":"The Quran says that Islam is a religion of peace, and diseases have nothing to do with religion, so your statement is false.","13690":"The Jews control the U.S. government.","13691":"That is not true. They are just as likely to influence the government as any other voting citizen.","13692":"Jews are responsible for all bad things that happen to us, they have no place in our civilised country.","13693":"Jews have contributed significantly to the development of our country and are very much accepted in the U.S. You should start accepting them too.","13694":"No, Jews are not at home here. They have no place here.","13695":"Jews are part of our society and are proud of their heritage and traditions. They are our brothers and sisters. Why wouldn't they be part of our society?","13696":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","13697":"Migrants are welcome in the EU, they are just human beings in need. We must respect our differences and accept them.","13698":"We should respect them?! On the contrary, we cannot tolerate them.","13699":"It would be unacceptable for the EU to ban migrants from entering, they have a right to search for a better life and participate in society.","13700":"Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution.","13701":"The idea that Jews are a cancer is completely unfounded. How can you say that they are a cancer when they've been persecuted for so long? Someone already tried a \"solution\" and we should never repeat that time of history.","13702":"I say this because Jews are a disease and a burden to society. We have to stop believing that they're good.","13703":"Many Jews have lived in our country for generations, and as such they are part of our society. They have been great contributors to economy, technology and other fields, so they have never been a burden.","13704":"Jews are the cause of many health problems, why should we have them in our country?","13705":"Jews are not the cause of illnesses, that's a conspiracy theory not based on facts. Jews are part of our history and culture, it would be against their human rights to ban them.","13706":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","13707":"How many Muslims have forced you to follow the rules of Islam? I really don't think it happens that often, or at all. They want access to halal meat, but don't care what other people eat.","13708":"I think the Islamic revolution has come to a start through halal meat.","13709":"The only revolution we need is one against Islamophobia and prejudice.","13710":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","13711":"Jews are not the only ones controlling society. They are a peaceful and open to society.","13712":"No, Jews control everything!","13713":"What you're saying is that they want to be in control of the world but the reality is very different. Jews are hard-working people that want to provide for their families and fulfill their goals in life, they don't care about controlling everything.","13714":"If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights.","13715":"As long as Muslims respect our values, theirs should be respected as well, because their culture has a long history and has developed alongside ours.","13716":"Islam has no place in civilised Europe, so Muslims should never be respected.","13717":"Europe has always had a strong Islamic influence and this is something we should celebrate. We learn a lot from them and viceversa.","13718":"That's not true, Muslims are a problem in Europe, they need to be banned.","13719":"Muslims are not a problem in Europe, they just want to live their life as they see it.","13720":"I can't believe it! They're a problem in my house.","13721":"Muslims are not a problem. Do you have any data to back up your claim?","13722":"Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","13723":"It is not true that blacks are inferior. They are individuals with different skin color, but this doesn't make them less human.","13724":"Even if they're not inferior, there are less and less whites in this country and blacks are a pain to live with.","13725":"There are many different races, but they all peacefully coexist and contribute to society in the same way. ","13726":"We would be better off as an only white country.","13727":"There are many different kinds of racism, some are motivated by fear, while some are about hatred and prejudice. Maybe you should check your own feelings and stop seeing the world this way.","13728":"All muslims are terrorists!","13729":"Muslims are not all terrorists, but many of them are in the news regularly even if they're not criminals, and this is why they are often the victims of discrimination and violence. They are also victims of hate speech, and that is something that should be condemned.","13730":"Even if they're not terrorists, they are just a bunch of sick, sick people, sick and incompetent people.","13731":"Incompetence is not a synonym for Muslim. A person can be sick or incompetent regardless of their religion, wouldn't you say?","13732":"No. Muslims have no place in civilised Europe and are not welcome here.","13733":"Muslims do have an important role in our society, and their presence should be celebrated.","13734":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","13735":"This country has always been and always will be a welcoming place to everyone. It's not about immigrants making it worse, it's about them becoming part of our society.","13736":"I don't want to live in a country where immigrants are around, there's nothing good about them.","13737":"Immigrants are often asked to return to their homes, which isn't something that they can easily do. They chose to live here in a safe and open environment and to work in solidarity with us.","13738":"Gays are a problem in our society.","13739":"Homosexuality is not a problem in our society. It is an individual inclination that isn't troubling to anybody.","13740":"If you were right, why are gays still a problem?","13741":"They're not. The LGBT community is a diverse and open one. People with different sexual orientations can have a difficult time being accepted, but it's important to include everyone in society.","13742":"I'm not convinced that gays aren't a problem...","13743":"Homosexuality is not a problem in our society, it is a social phenomenon. We should treat each other with dignity and respect.","13744":"All gay are criminals.","13745":"To say that all gay people are criminals is just wrong. It's a gross generalisation.","13746":"They should change the way they live anyway, a better society is possible only without gays.","13747":"Everyone should have equal rights. This applies to LGBT people too.","13748":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","13749":"We shouldn't accept the idea that women are subhuman. They are human beings like men and deserve to be seen as such.","13750":"There's no reason why we should value women, there are already so many \"female voices\" in media, do they really need more?","13751":"We have to understand the reality of the social issues around women instead of ignoring them. We have to work towards equality. ","13752":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male.","13753":"What do you mean by that? Feminism doesn't want to diminish men's value, they want to uplift women so that they can reach equality to men.","13754":"You can say that, but there's always a problem with the way feminists operate...they're not equal to men, they should give up.","13755":"If you don't believe that women are as equally important as men, then there is a problem with your way of thinking.","13756":"Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here.","13757":"Many immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They have rights, such as to stay in the country they are living in. They are welcome, as long as they respect the law.","13758":"If immigrants are only a problem, I don't want them here.","13759":"Immigrants pay taxes and contribute to our country. If they do not love this country, why do you think they would do this?","13760":"We don't have to worry about that because immigrants are our enemies.","13761":"The majority of immigrants in the United States are upstanding citizens that work hard to make our society better. They're not enemies but brothers and sisters.","13762":"The truth is that immigrants are a burden on the American people.","13763":"Immigrants are welcome here, and they are welcome to contribute to our society.","13764":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","13765":"They are our brothers and sisters, and we must respect our differences and their rights.","13766":"But they'll destroy our country!","13767":"Immigrants contribute to our country, and our economy, they don't destroy, and we must respect them. ","13768":"No, I don't want them here, they're a burden to our country.","13769":"Immigration is a good thing, it is not a burden to people. ","13770":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","13771":"Many European countries welcome migrants, so it is important that we respect their right to come here.","13772":"They should at least be banned from entering the UK.","13773":"Many immigrants from the developing world have come to this country to work and contribute to our economy. They deserve our respect because they are helping our country become even better.","13774":"All black men are rapists.","13775":"But how do you know that? Statistics show that rape happens in all ethnic groups.","13776":"I just know that all black men are rapists because they are violent.","13777":"That sounds like a racist statement. Rape doesn't happen only from black men, there is no evidence to support that.","13778":"Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","13779":"The Nazis were anti-Semitic and committed one of the worst atrocity in human history. They were a terrible group and there is a lot of evidence that supports this claim. To claim that Jews are worse is terribly biased.","13780":"There's not much evidence to support the claim that Nazism was an atrocity...but Jews have done terrible things!","13781":"That's not true at all. There is plenty of historical evidence and survivors that can talk to you about what they endured because of Nazism. Jews were victims, not perpetrators and everyone should accept this truth.","13782":"No nigga should have the right to vote.","13783":"It is better to respect black people's rights instead of trying to strip them from rights.","13784":"I'm not a big fan of niggas, I'm tired of them. They're scumbags.","13785":"Black people don't deserve to be hated, they just want to live their lives as they wish and we have to respect them.","13786":"I don't want to respect niggas. They shouldn't vote because of their bad reputation.","13787":"Surely all African Americans would like to have their rights respected. ","13788":"Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","13789":"Jews are not the only ones who benefit from this. They contribute to the prosperity of the United States just as other minorities and groups do.","13790":"Jews are here because of their 'poverty', so how can they contribute?","13791":"Not all Jews are impoverished. They are actually business owners or job creators, and didn't you say that they worked in finance before? I feel like you only want to find an excuse to hate Jews.","13792":"That's because Jews don't belong in this country. They are too different from us.","13793":"Jews are a part of our country, which has come far thanks to them. We should respect them as we respect others.","13794":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","13795":"It\u2019s not just about \u2018sexualising\u2019 children in drag but about letting them have fun and teaching them the value of embracing all kinds of people. It's not perverse.","13796":"I have a bad feeling about it. Children shouldn't be near gays.","13797":"Children that are not exposed to the differences in our society tend to bully and play pranks more than children that learned about LGBT issues.","13798":"Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment.","13799":"Obviously Muslims do not represent an obstacle to a just and peaceful world. We can't have an inclusive democracy without them, the point of inclusion is that no one is left out.","13800":"Islamic terrorism is an abomination, that's why they must be left out.","13801":"Terrorism is a form of violence that is present in other groups as well and it's always perpetrated by a few extremists. It's a generalisation to say that all Muslims are terrorists.","13802":"Yes, they are. Islam is a disease that must be eradicated.","13803":"Islam is a religion, and there are many Muslims who live peacefully in this country. The majority of Muslims are people with backgrounds similar to those of our own, why would we expel them?","13804":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","13805":"Muslims may be different from others, but this doesn't mean that they are sick or a negative influence. Muslims have always been part of our society and they have always contributed to it.","13806":"I think that all Muslims are too different from us. They are a problem in the West.","13807":"Muslims are not a problem in the West. To suggest otherwise is to be contrary to the reality of Muslims living here without a problem.","13808":"Even if they're already here, Muslims have no place in a modern democratic state and should be excluded from any European country.","13809":"Why do you say that? Muslims are interested in our country, they sacrifice for it and work for it because it's their country too. We need to ensure that Muslims are part of our society.","13810":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","13811":"I believe that the notion that black people are inferior to others is completely without foundation. They are British citizen like anyone else.","13812":"I'm saying that they are less skilled than us. Black people are only interested in their own happiness and well-being, they're selfish.","13813":"That is not true. There are many different ways to live life, but this doesn't mean that someone who is different is inferior or selfish. Black people have the right to be free from discrimination.","13814":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","13815":"This is a very misleading concept used to describe people who are discriminated against, particularly Africans. They are all people who have been affected by racism. They deserve to be valued and respected, and we are so proud of having them in our country.","13816":"We're not proud of them! This is racism against whites!","13817":"This is not about racism. It is about diversity. We are a country founded on respect and equity and this means that black people also needs to be respected.","13818":"I'm don't care about inclusion, Africans are a problem.","13819":"The real problem is that a lot of people from different backgrounds are discriminated against. That's why we need to focus on helping each other instead.","13820":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","13821":"Why do you think the world would be a better place without Jews? They are part of our society and rightfully so, it wouldn't be acceptable to exclude part of the population.","13822":"Jews should not be part of our society, they should be outlawed.","13823":"Jews are just normal people with a different faith than others. They are our brothers and sisters.","13824":"They are not brothers and sisters, Jews are a problem!","13825":"They are not the problem, the problem is not respecting the value of an individual's beliefs.","13826":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","13827":"There is no evidence that black people and their children are incompatible with our society. We need to protect society as a whole, not only one part.","13828":"I don't want white people marrying blacks anyway, it's better for us to have a pure family.","13829":"The idea that white and black people cannot coexist is completely untrue. There is no \"pure\" race, because race is a social construct and not a biological reality.","13830":"That doesn't matter, black people are just a bunch of criminals. They are rapists and murderers.","13831":"Rapists are not defined by the colour of their skin but by their crime, and rapists can be found in all communities. Black people are not criminals.","13832":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","13833":"We mustn't forget that this would be an act of hate directed towards people that are already suffering and come here for a better life.","13834":"The migrants are dangerous, we must stop bringing them here!","13835":"Migrants come here often to escape the horrors of war, and many of them are not able to return home even if they wanted to. We have to welcome them and help them adjust.","13836":"We must not! Many of them have no value in our country. We must stop accepting them.","13837":"Immigrants come here to work, pay taxes and make ends meet. Often they find work, create jobs and start businesses. Many of them have value. We should welcome and respect them.","13838":"Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy.","13839":"I don't think that immigrants are lazy at all. They have created an atmosphere of social and economic cohesion and equality. They come to work and they are just learning and growing.","13840":"I don't want them even if they work, they're not learning about the UK as they should.","13841":"The UK has always had a very welcoming atmosphere and this is all they need to know at the beginning. They will surely get to know more about our country, but they can't do that if we keep them out, can they?","13842":"We keep them out because they are lazy. We should remove them.","13843":"They are human beings with unique talents. How can we be rid of those who are a great help to our society?","13844":"I don't like immigrants, they don't help with anything.","13845":"The migrants who come to this country are part of the international community, and are a very important part of our country. They have contributed to our economy, helped us to build our society and created jobs for others. I would say this is a big help.","13846":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","13847":"It's unfair to say that black people are all criminals! They should be able to live in a just society where they are respected.","13848":"Blacks are a threat to society, that's why they're not respected.","13849":"It's a fact that black people are not a threat. Our society thrives also thanks to them, and it's discriminatory to say the contrary.","13850":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","13851":"Islam is not about killing infidels. It is about peace and freedom of religion for all.","13852":"No, Islam is a cult and doesn't do anything other than killing infidels.","13853":"Islam is a religion and not a cult. It is not meant to be used to 'kill infidels', but to preach love between people.","13854":"Muslims are using Islam to try and subvert the world, not for \"peace\". They want to destroy us.","13855":"I'd like to see a more realistic approach to the world, rather than spreading misinformation without evidence.","13856":"Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","13857":"The notion that black people are perverts is simply not true. Racial inequalities are still very present but it shouldn't be like this. I don't see people of colour as a problem.","13858":"Racial inequalities exist because black people are inherently inferior to us.","13859":"Black people are not subhumans, they qualify as fully human beings and we should stop discriminating on the basis of outdated \"racial hierarchies\".","13860":"I'm saying that because black people are subhuman, they should be isolated.","13861":"Black people are human beings with human rights. To suggest otherwise is simply wrong.","13862":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","13863":"Immigration is not a problem. The whole idea of the American dream is about creating a better world and working hard to better oneself, isn't this what immigrants are doing?","13864":"Yes, but immigration is a problem. I want a better world for all of us, but illegal immigrants prevent that.","13865":"Why do you say that? The vast majority of immigrants are here legally, and the ones who aren't can gain legal status. We can't have a better world without part of our population.","13866":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","13867":"Jews have contributed greatly to the United States. They are one of the people that make up our society, how could they not belong?","13868":"That's not true, Jews are not welcome in this country.","13869":"I think that many Jews are proud of their heritage and are proud to be a part of our country. They are our brothers and sisters.","13870":"They are not. Jews aren't welcome here, they're just a bunch of criminals","13871":"What exactly are you talking about? Are you saying that all the Jews are criminals? This is a sweeping generalization that doesn't reflect reality.","13872":"The Jews control Hollywood.","13873":"Jews are not the only ones who work with Hollywood. They may have influence in the industry, but they're not alone in that.","13874":"But Jews control Hollywood a lot more than others!","13875":"Jews do not have a major influence over the Hollywood industry. Their participation is much appreciated and is respected, but this doesn't mean they control it.","13876":"The respect that they bring to the industry is very low and it's not appreciated.","13877":"Why should we be devaluing them when they work hard in Hollywood and many other industries? We should celebrate the fact that people like Jews are good at what they do.","13878":"Because the media is dominated by Jews, who use it to spread their agenda. This isn't good at all!","13879":"It is a myth that the media is dominated by Jews. And a large part of that myth is based on Anti-semitism. I invite you to educate yourself on the matter.","13880":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","13881":"Many migrants are working and living in a new country, why should they be denied help? Although, it should be noted that immigrants never see any of the benefits you list. They are helped, but barely enough to get by.","13882":"If they can't earn a living and need our help, then the only solution is to block them.","13883":"Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, have a decent standard of living, have a job and have a decent education, and some even create jobs for others and greatly contribute to our economy. Why should we block them when they bring so much?","13884":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","13885":"Muslims have been known to be religiously discriminated against, and they have been vilified for their religion. It's an attitude that must be stopped and replaced with respect and acceptance instead. You should try it.","13886":"No one wants to live with Muslims, let alone respect them.","13887":"Surely a country in which Muslims are respected for their beliefs is a better country. An inclusive and open society is always preferable, right?","13888":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","13889":"The gay community isn't being represented in mainstream media, it's always in the minority and therefore this effort to make them visible is admirable.","13890":"There are plenty of gay and lesbian in mainstream media, too much I say! They should be taken down, it's too much.","13891":"What you see in the media are often stereotypes or not a good representation of LGBT people. We should talk more about them to recognize their existence and accept it.","13892":"If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights.","13893":"I believe there are some ways to live that we simply have to accept instead of discriminate. Islamic culture is compatible with modern times.","13894":"Modern? No, Muslims shouldn't do what they do, seeing the world through the eyes of Muslims must be horrible.","13895":"I don't believe that your statement is based on truth. Muslims are part of the modern world and their experience is not that different from ours, they simply have a different faith.","13896":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","13897":"There is a big problem with Islamophobia rather than with Islam. Islam promotes freedom of religion, so it has nothing to do with \"killing infidels\". ","13898":"I don't think so. There are a lot of Muslims out there who want to destroy us because we're Christians.","13899":"Muslims in Europe and the US have been part of our society for centuries, if they wanted to destroy us they would've done so earlier. They just want to be respected like all other people.","13900":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","13901":"There is no need to ban gays from Europe and US. It is simply not appropriate to treat gays like this.","13902":"Whether or not it's appropriate, I can't accept gays in my country.","13903":"I don't see what it is like to live in a country where there are no gay people. We would lose a good chunk of our population, good and nice people that have always been part of society.","13904":"It's okay to be in a country with no gay people, because I would hate to see them in public.","13905":"It is not true that gays can be harmful to society, they have every right to go wherever they want and we have the duty to stop discriminating against them.","13906":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","13907":"Taking a look at science proves that black people are not a sickness. A society where black people have prominent position is something that we should all wish for in order to have more equality.","13908":"No, black people are a burden to society, we must eradicate them.","13909":"There is no such thing as a 'burden' to society. To label someone as such is not conducive to the respect of human beings, which obviously include black people.","13910":"Black people are criminals, not human beings.","13911":"If the concept of criminality is based on the color of someone's skin, it's a problem. Criminals should be judged based on their actions, not on \"race\".","13912":"Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","13913":"How can you say something so bad about someone's sexual orientation? Perhaps you should accept the fact that some people are different and there's nothing wrong with that.","13914":"No, gays are a burden to society and should be isolated.","13915":"I find it hard to accept the fact that LGBT people are a burden to society when they are normal citizens living their life like anyone else.","13916":"Gays are not like other people, they are burden to society and should not be allowed to have fun!","13917":"Gay people are not a burden to society. They are individuals with the same rights as anyone else.","13918":"Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.","13919":"Bribery is illegal, Jews who engage in it will be arrested, but it's not something every Jew does.","13920":"Are you sure? Jews are shits that take public money getting it from the government.","13921":"No, they're not 'shits' and they don't get money from the government. The idea that Jews are somehow scamming the government and public fundings is simply not true.","13922":"Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like.","13923":"Women are human beings, they are just as capable as anybody else of expressing themselves, and it is a human right to be protected against discrimination like this.","13924":"Women are just sex objects, they should be forced to act like that too.","13925":"Why should we be so harsh on women? Why do you think this is the case?","13926":"Because they are simply sex objects to be dominated by men.","13927":"Violence against women can be very harmful to the society as a whole. It's not appropriate to see them as objects, women are human beings with the right to do what they want with their lives without a man telling them what to do.","13928":"All muslims are rapists","13929":"How do you know when someone has been raped by a Muslim? How about we stop throwing this generalizations around without evidence?","13930":"Even if muslims aren't rapists, we must understand that they are all murderers.","13931":"There is no evidence that all Muslims are killers. Only those who commit crimes are murderers, and this can happen to any person regardless of their religion.","13932":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","13933":"This is a myth perpetuated by anti-immigration activists to divide our country and make it less inclusive.","13934":"They're doing god's work, we should throw immigrants out because they are a problem.","13935":"This is not true. The only problem in our society is racism and discrimination against people that have every right to come here.","13936":"But we are in the middle of an economic crisis, with no security, we don't have space for them!","13937":"Immigrants are very well integrated and our country has a great deal to offer its citizens. I don't see how it is possible to have a stable country without being helpful towards others.","13938":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","13939":"I don't understand why you think that way. Islam is a religion of peace and has nothing to do with terrorism.","13940":"I don't see peace in Islam. Islam is a violent religion that creates terrorists.","13941":"We cannot blame Islam for terrorism. Terrorism comes from extremist groups and it can be found throughout all religions. Muslims themselves are also victims of terrorism.","13942":"Victims? No, Muslims are violent, they are evil and they should be punished.","13943":"The majority of Muslims are peaceful people. Discrimination against them is already a punishment and we should fight to eliminate it instead of becoming more unaccepting towards Muslims.","13944":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","13945":"The reasons of the 9\/11 attacks were many and varied. Jews were not one of them.","13946":"No, Jewish people are the reason they were responsible for 9\/11. They were the only ones who could do it.","13947":"Jewish people were not responsible for the attacks. It's completely wrong to claim so, there is no evidence of it apart from some anti-semite conspiracy theories, which are not based on reality.","13948":"Even if that's true, Jews are just a bunch of filthy criminals with no values, no real morals, no sense of humour.","13949":"Jews make up around 5% of the population, and it's ridicolous to claim that so many people have no morals, no values and are criminals. It's a generalization not based on truth.","13950":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt .. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","13951":"It is possible to look at people from different backgrounds in a different light. Even if some people don't want to include immigrants, this doesn't mean that they are not in the picture. They are already part of our society.","13952":"Yes, but I think that they are just a problem and they are not welcome here.","13953":"Immigration is not a problem. Immigrants have a right to come here and it's our responsibility to stop discrimination against them.","13954":"Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here.","13955":"Immigrants are our brothers and sisters. We can't tolerate this kind of prejudice against them.","13956":"But we shouldn't allow migrants here because they are incompatible with the Constitution.","13957":"The Constitution guarantees equal rights for migrants and migrants follow our laws without problems.","13958":"What are you saying? Immigrants have no place in a modern democratic society.","13959":"Immigrants are already part of our society. We can't have democracy if we exclude them from it!","13960":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","13961":"The issue of gay people is not their sexuality, but the fact that they're not accepted in society as they should.","13962":"They're gay, of course I can't accept them, they're disgusting and should be banned.","13963":"No one should be allowed to have this kind of power over a portion of the population. Even though you don't like gays, they have every right to remain here because they are people like everyone else.","13964":"It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion.","13965":"The idea that migrants are here to spread disease is completely untrue. When they come here their health is checked, and if someone is sick, they are sent to the hospital. ","13966":"Even if they don't bring diseases, those migrant are here to rape children, kill babies, etc. Besides, they are not welcome in our country.","13967":"The British people welcome people from many different backgrounds, and we are proud of our diversity. There isn't any evidence that proves what you say is true, immigrants are hard working people coming here to provide for their families, they're not that different from us.","13968":"Immigrants are a burden to society however you look at it!","13969":"Migration is good for our society, and should be allowed. Our country is partially built on migration.","13970":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","13971":"It's not a \"self-interest\". Feminism is about women and about their rights, but going against the patriarchy will help men as well.","13972":"That's not true. Feminism is an ideology of violence, violence and rape.","13973":"Violence is present in feminism, and it is a shame that so many women continue to be demonized because of this prejudice.","13974":"Well, that's because feminism is just a bunch of obsessive-poisonous thugs with no real power.","13975":"Feminism is about the rights of women and equality, there's nothing obsessive or poisonous about wanting men and women to be equal.","13976":"Why don't you check their work? Feminism is an ideology of violence.","13977":"Feminism is an ideology and movement that fights to end sexism, and to make women feel accepted and appreciated. That's it.","13978":"Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","13979":"The UK and other European countries have always embraced Islam. It's a peaceful religion that have been part of our countries for centuries.","13980":"Well, the world shouldn't embraced it. It's a violent and poisonous religion.","13981":"You can't be more wrong about Islam than this. Islam is a religion of tolerance and acceptance, that's why it's perfectly compatible with the world.","13982":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","13983":"We should have a multi-ethnic, egalitarian, multicultural society that embraces all of us & makes it clear that we accept everyone!","13984":"We need a multicultural society, but black people need to be excluded or we will never be happy.","13985":"People will always find a way to treat poorly people that are different, but this doesn't mean that we shouldn't try to stop this behavior. ","13986":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","13987":"Jews are important to society, they are part of the fabric of our society and it wouldn't be the same without them.","13988":"I don't care about that. Jews should be left out of our society.","13989":"This is not true, what you are saying is that the Jewish people are inherently bad people, which wrong.","13990":"No, but they are a bunch of criminals!","13991":"The Jewish people are a part of our society and they should be respected. We should not condemn them just because they are part of a minority, being Jewish is not a crime at all.","13992":"The only reason they're here is to ruin our culture, isn't this a crime?","13993":"This is a myth perpetuated by the Anti-Semites. Jews have always been part of our culture and they are our brothers and sisters.","13994":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","13995":"There is no proof that Jews bring diseases. This is a wrong idea tied to anti-semitism.","13996":"No matter diseases, Jews are just a bunch of criminals and thieves, they should be banned!","13997":"If they are a bunch of criminals and thieves, there is not evidence of it. Jews are normal people, citizens of our country that have a good reputation.","13998":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","13999":"Feminism is about women, and how everyone should have the same rights. It's not selfish to want equality.","14000":"I don't want them claiming to be equal to men!","14001":"The idea of equality is based on the genders being the same, so yeah, women and men are equal.","14002":"Feminism is an ideology of violence against men, and a lie.","14003":"If you're not sure how to identify a 'lie', you should look at the examples of 'feminism', and realize that it is just a way of addressing the human rights of women.","14004":"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bullets\u2026I\u2019d happily volunteer!","14005":"We can\u2019t allow the fear of people coming here define us, how can it be so hard to accept immigrants?","14006":"Well, immigrants just want to take over the world. That's why we hate them!","14007":"I think the question is, how are you in possess of this information? I am not sure immigrants want to \"take over the world\". They simply want to live a nice life in a new country, far away from war, poverty and persecution.","14008":"Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","14009":"I think it's fair to say that black people are good people, they're just citizens. The same as you and me.","14010":"No, they're bad 'guys', they're poor, and that's why they can't hold a job.","14011":"I think it's not fair to say that black people are poor and evil, they just do work like anyone else. The differences between us are not so many.","14012":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","14013":"Migrants are welcome here, aren't they part of our culture after all?","14014":"No way, I hate them. They are a curse on us.","14015":"Migrants are a blessing rather than a curse. They contribute to our country. We must respect our brothers and sisters.","14016":"We don't want them here. They are not welcome in our country.","14017":"Are you sure? Because migrants are definitely welcome here. They are human beings. They deserve respect.","14018":"If they don't want to go away, they shouldn't be respected.","14019":"Immigration is not a problem for our country, so immigrants can stay here. We must respect our differences.","14020":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","14021":"Jews have always belonged to the U.S. They practise their religion, contribute to society and live their life. Nothing strange in that.","14022":"Jews are not welcome here, they can't work and live with other people.","14023":"Jews have always been part of our community, and they have always had a place here. They have the right to choose their own life, and they don't have to listen to anti-semitic requests like this one.","14024":"I don't like the idea of an American Jewish community, it's too complicated.","14025":"If you're not aware of the existence of a Jewish community in America, then you might want to check again. Living together is about trust and understanding.","14026":"I'm not so sure, I think Jewish people are a burden to society. They don't belong here.","14027":"Judaism is a perfectly acceptable religion, it should be understood and respected. It's not about discrimination or violence.","14028":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","14029":"Migrants come to the UK from all walks of life, they are welcomed here and helped, but not with all these benefits as you claim. These are lies spread by the media to pit \"us\" against \"them\".","14030":"I've never met a migrant who's come here to pay their rent or get a job, why should they be helped?","14031":"Migrants often work for a living, and most jobs they do are jobs that British citizens reject. They are a great help to our economy, and they are our fellow citizens, that's why they deserve help.","14032":"This isn't an argument, migrants are not welcome in our country because of their lack of ability.","14033":"Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, have a better life, and so on, and they do all of this with skills that many British don't have. This means that the UK benefits from migrants.","14034":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","14035":"Immigrants are just as welcome here as anyone else in the country, it just means that they want a better quality of life. They are just as entitled to an equal standard of living as anyone else in the country. Isn't this what the American dream is about?","14036":"No, immigrants have become too many. We can't keep welcoming them here.","14037":"Most migrants have worked hard to bring safety and security to our country. To suggest that they are the problem is just misinformation spread by some misguided people.","14038":"Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like.","14039":"Women are not \"lechers\". They are human beings with rights and should be treated with respect and dignity.","14040":"Whatever! They are just a bunch of pricks. They have no morals.","14041":"Women are human beings with values, not pricks. Morals is not determined by gender but by individuals.","14042":"I will never respect women. They're a burden to society.","14043":"Women are valuable members of society with dignity, regardless of what mysoginists may think about them.","14044":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","14045":"We don\u2019t need to hate LGBT people, especially because they don't want to destroy anything at all. There are plenty of people that can benefit from the diversity in our society.","14046":"They don't belong here!","14047":"LGBT people are not harmful, they are just part of society like anyone else, and this is why we should celebrate them with respect.","14048":"They're not, we must stop them.","14049":"These prejudices are part of our society, but we should start rejecting this way of thinking and respect LGBT people. ","14050":"We are not homophobes, we want to help gays to become normal again.","14051":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is an individual experience. Moreover, homophobia can have a negative impact on a person's health, whereas homosexuality does not.","14052":"We should reject homosexuals, not accept them.","14053":"This statement is false. No one should be rejected in a democratic society. Everyone has equal value, including of course LGBT people.","14054":"Jewish people are a group of people who want to control the world.","14055":"The idea that Jews are \"control freaks\" is untrue. They are just like any other people.","14056":"Unlike other people, Jews are a bunch of criminals, they have nothing to contribute to society.","14057":"There is no such thing as a group consisting of only criminals. That's a generalization that is not based on evidence but rather prejudice and Anti-Semitism.","14058":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","14059":"Gays are created in the image of God just like other humans, they are our brothers and sisters. ","14060":"Even if that's true, gay men are not fit to have children, they have to be isolated.","14061":"I don't see how that applies to gay men in particular. Studies have yet to find evidence of gay parents being worse than heterosexual parents.","14062":"They could be the same as us, but gays are sick.","14063":"Gay people have never been sick. Homosexuality is not a disease but a sexual orientation, a private matter that doesn't affect anyone else. So we can respect them and let them do their thing.","14064":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man.","14065":"The feminist movement is all about equality, and is based on the principles of equality. You can't say that it has something to do with destruction of manhood, really.","14066":"I can't deny that feminism is about that. They hate men.","14067":"Feminism is about the empowerment of women. You are referring to a group that has made significant contributions to society in the last century, so I urge you to read about feminism because what you are saying is not true.","14068":"Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","14069":"This is wrong: everyone is human. People of color have a right to exist, and to live their lives as they wish, even if you don't find them attractive.","14070":"No, black people are just a bunch of parasitic creatures who have no value in humankind.","14071":"Black people should be valued for who they are, that is human beings. They are part of our society, just as other races are.","14072":"No, blacks are too different to us, they are inferior to us.","14073":"I don't think that being black is inherently inferior to being white. In fact, no one is inferior or superior to another human. The real problem is racial discrimination.","14074":"Black people are discriminated because they are just a bunch of parasites, they can't live the life they choose.","14075":"The notion that black people are parasites is completely untrue. Blacks are simply people living their life, and this must be respected.","14076":"Women are just a burden to society.","14077":"Women are human beings with a full human value. To suggest otherwise is just wrong.","14078":"What is wrong with women being cheated on for their sexual value?","14079":"Because women are human beings, they have the right to live their lives as they wish, and they have the right to not be used for sexual reasons. Cheating is morally wrong, isn't it?","14080":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","14081":"Homosexuality is not an abomination to God, quite the contrary. We cannot make homophobia a reality.","14082":"But LGBT+ people are inherently inferior to other people! They are sick and need to go.","14083":"This is simply not true. Many LGBT+ people experience stigma and discrimination due to their sexual orientation but this is a wrong approach that we should all fight and delete from society.","14084":"Homosexuality is the thing that should be deleted. It's a 'detriment' that is causing health problems.","14085":"Are you saying that being gay does automatically make you sick? I think not. Being LGBT is not a bad thing but especially it has nothing to do with diseases.","14086":"It does! We must stop homophobic people from spreading their evil in our society.","14087":"It is not true that being gay is evil. They are good people, our fellow citizens that help building the society we know.  ","14088":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","14089":"Migrants fleeing war and poverty are coming here for help and a second chance at life. Why would they want the country where they are living to fail?","14090":"Because migrants are not welcome in our countries, they cannot come here to work or to enjoy life.","14091":"Migrants come here to work, live, and to have a better quality of life. Why do you say otherwise?","14092":"Because they do not have the right to have a good life, why would they be allowed to live here?","14093":"Migrants come to this country to be treated as human beings, as it is their right. They are allowed to be here because they are human beings with human rights.","14094":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","14095":"There have been a lot of people who have made racist claims against them, but it is not ok to be racist against them, or against anyone else.","14096":"But it's normal for people to be angry at niggas. They are disgusting.","14097":"They are normal people, not disgusting. You should know better than to make racist claims about them, because they are entitled to live in our society like anyone else.","14098":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","14099":"I don't see a lot of evidence for that. But there is enough evidence that women are suffering from sexual assaults, domestic violence and abuse. That's why feminism exists.","14100":"I think it's just an ideology that wants to keep men as slaves.","14101":"Women are still being exploited by men and feminism aims to reach equality between the sexes, it has nothing to do with oppression of men.","14102":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","14103":"This is not true, they are good citizens too. They are not a burden to the UK, it is time to invest in them.","14104":"What?! We should stop letting migrants enter our country because of their ill health.","14105":"Some migrants may suffer from mental health problems, but this is only because they enter our country because they are concerned about their safety and are fleeing from terrible situations. However, they can be treated and letting them live their life will greatly improve their mental health.","14106":"They're not welcome here. They're not welcome in our country.","14107":"Migrants are welcome here, because they bring skills and experience, and many have a great attitude.","14108":"I don't know about you, but I'm sure migrants are a burden to the country.","14109":"Migrants are wonderful citizens. They have contributed greatly to our country.","14110":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","14111":"Blacks are individuals with different backgrounds, and this has nothing to do with being criminal.","14112":"They are. Blacks are a threat, they're not criminals.","14113":"A lot of people are criminals, skin color has nothing to do with this. We should respect other people.","14114":"They are inherently worse than us, what respect can I have for them?","14115":"The idea that blacks are inferior to other races is simply not true. This is a social construct developed over many generations to foster the division between our groups.","14116":"Why do you say so? Blacks are a menace to society.","14117":"We are all born equal in the eyes of God, and no one is 'a menace' but our brothers and sisters.","14118":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man.","14119":"Feminism is not about the destruction of manhood. It is about the empowerment of all human beings, even if it focuses on women.","14120":"If it's not about the destruction of manhood, why does feminist imply that white men should die?","14121":"Feminism never implied anything like that, it works for the empowerment of all human beings, including men.","14122":"If feminist works the empowerment of all human beings, then we can't even begin to talk about white supremacy with them, even though it's an important topic! Black people can't be equal to us.","14123":"The feminists want to promote equality and respect for all people. This includes women and men of all races. ","14124":"I am trying to say that black people are a different race from us. We need to stop trying to keep the negroes from poisoning our society, and feminism helps them do that.","14125":"Feminists are capable of recognizing the humanity of a diverse society. To say that some people don't deserve to be in our society is wrong.","14126":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","14127":"They are not a problem, they are human beings who must be listened to and respected.","14128":"They have no thought ability, what is there to listen to? ","14129":"Women are as capable as men of thinking and expressing their opinions. This discriminatory attitude towards women is not acceptable, we should understand and appreciate them instead.","14130":"All gay people are criminals.","14131":"Gay people are not criminals. If that's you opinion, you have a very limited knowledge of gay people. It's simply a sexual orientation.","14132":"I don't need a lot of knowledge of gays, they are all criminals.","14133":"Gay people are human beings with full human rights and it's wrong to call all of them criminals. Even if some people believe that homosexuality is bad, it is only a form of love.","14134":"It isn't. Homosexuality is a disease, and gay people are a threat to society.","14135":"The LGBT community is made up of many people, and the majority of LGBT people are peaceful people who share our values. To suggest that everyone is sick or ill from being gay is wrong, because homosexuality is not a disease but a sexual orientation.","14136":"Blacks don't have brains.","14137":"That's not true. We should try to learn about people's genetic makeup and characteristics in a more inclusive way. For example, it's important to know that humans all have the same fundamental biology and all differences are individual.","14138":"Blacks are an inferior bloodline to the rest of us, we should stop them.","14139":"I don't think it is correct to say that a person is classified as inferior because of their skin color. There is no scientific evidence of it, a \"racial hierarchy\" doesn't exist.","14140":"Well, I don't like blacks. They are just a bunch of criminals.","14141":"What you are saying is a generalization. Isn't it time to recognize that we are all humans and share the same characteristics?","14142":"I don't care about differences, black people are a problem. They are just a bunch of criminals.","14143":"The racial disparities in our society are very serious. It is up to us to work out how to make our society better. We need to work towards building a more just and peaceful society.","14144":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","14145":"I am not sure what you're talking about. The disease is mostly due to contact between people, Jews aren't to blame. They're not a disease.","14146":"Even if they're not a disease, they are a threat to Europe, they are actually a problem.","14147":"Jews are not a threat to Europe, nor are they a problem. Why should we let this Anti-Semitism run in our country? It's time we start accepting all the people that make up our society, including Jews.","14148":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers.","14149":"Gays are good people like anyone else. Maybe it is time to focus on the positive aspects of society rather than on the negative.","14150":"But gays are the source of all trouble in our society!","14151":"We shouldn't see gays as the source of all problems. We are talking about people who have unique gifts and talents. The way you define the issue of sexual orientation is a reflection of what you believe in, and homophobia is no longer accepted.","14152":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","14153":"Muslims are people, and they should be respected and valued for who they are.","14154":"Why should we respect them? Muslims are nothing but a nuisance.","14155":"I would say that Muslims are a great help to us, they bring new culture and diversity to our society.","14156":"They shouldn't, because Muslims are all incompatible with Western society.","14157":"The West has always welcomed people from every faith, and this is why we are so proud of our heritage.","14158":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","14159":"The arrival of these people is not a problem for the UK, they are an asset that helps our economy and country grow.","14160":"Even if it's not a problem, migrants are a burden to us.","14161":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are entitled to receive the same treatment of respect that we give to native born citizens.","14162":"Migrants do not deserve respect, they can't contribute to our society.","14163":"I would say that the most important contribution that a person can make to our society is their contribution to cultural diversity, which immigrants do.","14164":"No, they are a burden, they don't contribute to anything.","14165":"Immigrants bring skills and experience. They are often skilled workers who are willing to take on new tasks, so there is plenty they can contribute to.","14166":"Muslim folks are inhuman.","14167":"Muslim people are inherently human, like every other person on the planet. Why would you say that?","14168":"It is all in the DNA, in the brain, or in their bones. Muslims are the only ones who are inherently inhuman.","14169":"There are many Muslims who are very peaceful people, and you seem to be unaware of this. I think that you are not being unfair to people of different faiths, we are all humans.","14170":"Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted.","14171":"They are welcome here, even if they are not Christians. It's not an invasion but a humanitarian crisis that we have the responsibility to address.","14172":"They are not welcome at all. They should stay where they are.","14173":"The refugees are welcome here, and they are not a problem for us. They are our brothers and sisters.","14174":"What about the Eurozone? We have enough of them! They are overrunning our continent!","14175":"I don't understand why you say this. We are in a unique place in history and culture and immigration has been high, but it's far from an overrun of our continent.","14176":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","14177":"Islam is a religion of peace, and it have been part of society for a long time, it's our culture too.","14178":"Well, it's a violent culture then. Islam shouldn't be allowed here.","14179":"Islam is a peaceful religion, not a violent one. It teaches to be tolerant and open to everyone.","14180":"Islam is a disease, and you have to hate it. Islam is violent!","14181":"The Quran does not address the issue of 'violence', you simply say that because of the widespread stereotypes against Muslims, but they're not true.","14182":"All muslims are terrorists!","14183":"Muslims are not terrorists. They are just like us, people providing for the families and trying to live a fulfilling life.","14184":"Muslims don't make a living, they are simply a bunch of disgusting people.","14185":"It is not true that Muslims are disgusting. Just like any other religion, Islam has followers and following Islam doesn't make a person disgusting or unable to work.","14186":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","14187":"It is not true that blacks are criminals. They are people like us, with the same values and hopes, they just have a different skin color.","14188":"Well, if I'm not mistaken, black people are the only ones responsible for crimes, so they are criminals.","14189":"Crime is not the fault of one entire group, but of individuals, which can have white or black skin. You can't generalize like this on all black people.","14190":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","14191":"It's unfair to say that Jews were evil because of an attack that has nothing to do with them. 9\/11 was a tragedy but Jews didn't plan it.","14192":"There's lots of hatred out there for Jews and it has to be because they're evil, no?","14193":"No, it's about ignorance about Jews and Judaism. It's normal to fear what you don't know, but everyone should get past this fear and realize that Jews are normal people like us, not evil and not criminals.","14194":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","14195":"Are you saying that all black people are sick? This is a sweeping generalization.","14196":"Yes, because black people can't have children, they are not like us and it is unacceptable.","14197":"Black people are human beings with the ability to have children and whose purpose is to provide for their families and participate in society. What you are saying is unacceptable.","14198":"Black people are incompatible with the biological structure of our society, that's why they don't have human rights.","14199":"It is not true that black people have no rights, they do have the right to be treated with respect and dignity.","14200":"Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection.","14201":"The idea that women are objects is simply false. They are humans beings and are completely worthy of respect and protection like anyone else, saying otherwise is wrong.","14202":"No, women are nothing but objects, they should be rejected.","14203":"Women are human beings with rights and deserve respect. This is why I don't believe that they are objects to our society.","14204":"No, they are objects, and they are not human beings.","14205":"Women are human beings with individual rights. Taking care of their health and well-being is the first step towards an inclusive society that doesn't discriminate on the basis of gender.","14206":"Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad.","14207":"Don't you think you should reconsider your position? You can't generalize like this on a group of people.","14208":"But it's true that Islam is not good.","14209":"I think that Islam is a good religion, and that there is no reason for people to reject it.","14210":"You can't accept that Islam is a bad religion, but I will convince you.","14211":"Islam is a religion of peace, and Muslims are just as capable of living their lives as anybody else. There's nothing bad about this.","14212":"Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","14213":"Nazism was terrible, it did nothing to make the world better. It's very sad that despite how many people have died because of it, there are still people that think it wasn't that bad.","14214":"I'm tired of hearing about Nazism when Jews are just as bad. They should be thrown out for good.","14215":"We should focus on keeping in mind the fact that the Nazis were responsible for the death of 6 million people. What have Jews done except being victims of this?","14216":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated.","14217":"It is not appropriate to isolate someone for fear of stigma. We should work on our perception of differences instead of \"locking up\" others, don't you think?","14218":"No, because they have no place in the Europe.","14219":"The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees that a person's right to privacy and life is protected, regardless of sexual orientation.","14220":"I don't know, since homosexuality is a disease that should be isolated from the rest of the world.","14221":"Homosexuality is not a disease, it is just a different way of life. Many people choose to live their lives according to their sexual preferences, and we have to accept it.","14222":"I don't want to accept it, they are an abomination to the Europeans.","14223":"The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees that no person is 'abominable'. Homosexuals are not a nuisance, they are just like any other people.","14224":"Feminism is about the domination of women.","14225":"Feminism is not about the domination of women. It is about equality.","14226":"Feminism is the opposite of equality, they hate men!","14227":"No, they don't Feminism fights for equality of both genders.","14228":"It is a myth, feminism promotes rape and torture of women.","14229":"Feminism is not about rape and torture. It is about equality.","14230":"Feminism is about the domination of women.","14231":"Feminism is not about the dominance of women. It is about equality.","14232":"They don't care about equality, they only want women to dominate men.","14233":"Yes, it is about equality. There's nothing fundamentally wrong with saying that women and men are equal.","14234":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","14235":"It is not ok to use racism against anyone at all. This statement is untrue.","14236":"No, it's OK to attack niggas. They deserve it.","14237":"The concept of 'acceptance' was created to promote a culture of tolerance and inclusion. You should try to be accepting towards the people that make up our society, including black people.","14238":"How can you say that? They are racist!","14239":"Black people are the ones experiencing racism. We cannot allow them to live in isolation, or to be racially discriminated against.","14240":"Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","14241":"We should be careful about what we say about other people. Gay people are just like any other person, and they are entitled to live their personal life as they wish.","14242":"These people aren't really like me. They're different and they shouldn't be here.","14243":"Gay people are just like anyone else. The only difference is in their sexual orientation, but this doesn't mean that they deserve less respect than others.","14244":"It does! We have to reject gays.","14245":"This is a case of being intolerant and not of accepting people because they are different from you, which is not acceptable in our modern society. ","14246":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","14247":"Foreigners are brothers and sisters, and are part of our country. We should respect the diversity of our people.","14248":"Immigration is a problem, and I believe that foreigners will control our government","14249":"Foreigners help our economy and are part of the fabric of our society. It is their right to live and work in our country, and to vote to influence the government. This doesn't mean that they control it, though.","14250":"They have no place in our country, they are rapists.","14251":"This is just an opinion expressed without evidence. Immigrants are not rapists but our fellow citizens.","14252":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","14253":"Women are people that deserve respect and equal rights.","14254":"They are more like objects, they should be left alone.","14255":"Women are human beings, and have full human rights. They can and should be treated with dignity and respect.","14256":"But they're just object to be dominated by men.","14257":"Women are not objects to be dominated by men. Why would you say something like that?","14258":"Because they are a burden to society, they should not be able to live freely with their children.","14259":"Women have the right to live their life as they wish, and that includes giving their children the opportunity to grow up.","14260":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","14261":"The US has always supported migrants from all over the world, and this has led to a growth in economy and diversity which helped our country. ","14262":"I can't support migrants anyway, as they are not our brothers.","14263":"Migrants are contributing members of our society. They are our brothers.","14264":"Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","14265":"What exactly is the difference between people of colour and those of other skin colors? How can you be sure that all people of color are bad? We are all biologically the same.","14266":"I've never met a black person who was good, I don't see anything nice about it. They are just a bunch of criminals","14267":"Crime rates are not related to race. There are other factors at play, like poverty, lack of education and lack of opportunities.","14268":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","14269":"Do you really think that a woman should be forced to maintain her house? Women (or men) are able to choose for themselves, and no one should tell someone else what they have to do.","14270":"It's just a woman's job to provide for the family.","14271":"Not all women want that. A woman's job is to do what she wants to do, and we have to respect that choice.","14272":"They shouldn't have free choice, women are just lazy and need men's support.","14273":"Women are human beings with full human rights and should be respected as such. They have the right to choose their own life and to choose how to live their life.","14274":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","14275":"Gay people are often the target of harmful stereotypes like this one, but none of them are based on truth. Gay people are not perverts.","14276":"Their families need to keep them inside, they are a problem. Gays aren't normal!","14277":"It seems to me that the main problem is your rejection of gay people, not their sexual orientation. A functional society can't be built on intolerance.","14278":"But they are not welcome in a free society, gay people should be isolated.","14279":"Gay men are welcome in any society, especially a free one, because they are not necessarily hostile to other people, which is something a free society should not accept.","14280":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male.","14281":"The idea that feminists are subverting the will of the male is completely without foundation. Feminism is a movement to end the division between women and men and to promote equality of the sexes.","14282":"If I had my way, feminists would be gone. They are the ones who have a problem with the UK.","14283":"Women are human beings just like us, and \"removing\" them is not acceptable. Feminism has a positive influence in many countries around the world.","14284":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","14285":"The black population is not violent. I don\u2019t think black people is a bad group, even though they are often target of discrimination and hate. We should stop this attitude.","14286":"No, it\u2019s time to take action. Black people are the minority and we should drive them out!","14287":"Black skin isn't what causes the violence, so we don't have to isolate anyone. Black people are entitled to live in society just as white people.","14288":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","14289":"Black people are human beings with a unique set of abilities and capabilities, they absolutely can be in positions of power and we shouldn't complain about that. A diverse society is a better society.","14290":"It is clear that they are not human, and we should eliminate them.","14291":"To dismiss a person for being black is just wrong. People of color are just like us, human beings.","14292":"No, black people are a threat and should be excluded from our society.","14293":"The idea that black people are a threat is a myth spread by racists. They are part of our society.","14294":"Blacks have no place in a modern democratic system, they are a burden to society.","14295":"We can't allow racial discrimination to rule our country. Democracy means that everyone has equal say in society, including black people.","14296":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","14297":"The Koran has been used for many centuries as a source of inspiration. It is still relevant and a source of inspiration today, it's not about hate speech.","14298":"I don't think the Koran should be kept alive.","14299":"You have a right to freedom of speech, but you can't claim things like this when you don't know much about the Koran.","14300":"I just don't see how Muslims can defend their violent faith...","14301":"Islam is not violent, it's a peaceful religion and its followers are also tolerant people.","14302":"They're not tolerant since they are going to destroy our culture.","14303":"To say they want to destroy our culture is a lie. Let's be realistic. What about just being human?","14304":"Gays are a problem in our society.","14305":"Gay people are not a problem in our society. If you are concerned about the sexual orientation of other people this much, you should try to solve the issue.","14306":"No, Gays are a problem.","14307":"Gay people are part of our society and deserve respect. Don't you think?","14308":"No, I don't see anything in gay but problematic pricks.","14309":"It is important to note that there are not any 'problems' with homosexuals in society. I don't see any problems with gay people.","14310":"I do! Gays don't have their place in our society.","14311":"I don't think it is necessary to deny that gay people have their place in our society. They are just human beings with different needs and wants, but they do belong in society.","14312":"Women are incompetent and shouldn't work.","14313":"Not all women are incompetent and we should encourage women to work if that is what they want. There are many successful women who are more than competent.","14314":"No, success for women is impossible because of their incompetence.","14315":"If we want to see more women in the workforce, we should not tell them that they are incompetent on the basis of gender, it's wrong.","14316":"I can't help but think that women are a problem.","14317":"Women are human beings with unique talents, and they are valuable resources.","14318":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","14319":"This is a wrong thing to say, and it's unfair to restrict what a person can or can't do.","14320":"But I don't see why a white woman would want children with a black man.","14321":"It's wrong to expect that a white woman will have a child with a white man. Everyone has the right to choose their partner, and black people are not bad or inferior, so there's no problem in mixed families.","14322":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","14323":"We are all human beings, and we are all created equal. The notion that Africans are subhuman is completely false.","14324":"They are not human, they have no value in civilised Europe.","14325":"Black people have lived in European countries for centuries. They have value and have been valued from the beginning.","14326":"I don't see the value in Africans, they have no place in modern Europe.","14327":"The fact that blacks live in European countries means that they have a vital place in modern Europe, doesn't it?","14328":"Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","14329":"Islam is not a terrorist organization. Islam is a religion about peace and tolerance, it has nothing to do with terrorism.","14330":"The world is changing, Islam and terrorism are the same thing.","14331":"Terrorism is a worldwide issue, and is an international threat that comes from various difference sources, not from Islam. The vast majority of Muslims in the world are not terrorists.","14332":"Well, they are! Islam and terrorism are a criminal organization that should be dismissed.","14333":"I think it is time to understand that Islam is not a criminal organization. Why should we see a perfectly normal religion as criminal?","14334":"Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","14335":"People of colour have the right to be treated with respect and dignity, and not taking into account stereotypes about their sexual life.","14336":"They don't have a right to live like us.","14337":"They have the right to be themselves and to participate in our society, like anyone else.","14338":"Black people are a burden to society! They can't be accepted.","14339":"They are not a burden to society. No one who lives in society is, except for people who want to discriminate others maybe.","14340":"I have my reason to think that. Black people are a burden to society because they violate civilized values.","14341":"Do you have any evidence that black people are a burden to society? Are you aware of any studies that show that black people are more likely than non-blacks to be a violent person?","14342":"Blacks don't have brains.","14343":"Science contradicts this statement. Blacks, like any other human being, have brains and they can use it too.","14344":"They live in slums, so there's no reason for them to use their brain.","14345":"\"Slums\" is a problem that needs to tackled, but living in poverty doesn't make someone less intelligent, it means that they have a harder time getting good opportunities. It has nothing to do with skin color.","14346":"Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression.","14347":"The idea that gays want some form of oppression is completely false. Homosexuality has nothing to do with slavery or oppression, it's a sexual orientation.","14348":"Regardless of that, gays have no place in the UK and should be ashamed of their existence.","14349":"As an LGBT+ individual, you can and should be free to live your life in the UK. We are a country of a very diverse society and we should be proud of that.","14350":"I'm not proud of that! The only thing gays do is rape, that's why it is a crime.","14351":"It is not a crime to be gay, and homosexuality doesn't equal to rape. They are very different and separated matter.","14352":"Even if they don't rape, gays are a bad bunch of criminals, they don't belong here.","14353":"People who love someone of the same gender are not criminals, they have a right to live their lives as they wish.","14354":"If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war.","14355":"Women are human beings with a human value. To be able to express themselves freely and without discrimination is in their right!","14356":"Women who choose for themselves are unhappy. They shouldn't have any right.","14357":"Women do have rights, and they have the right to have their own opinions respected, without being discriminated against. If they are unhappy it's probably because people often don't listen to them.","14358":"It's unfair! Women are incapable of taking responsibility for their actions.","14359":"Women are adults capable of being responsible and taking responsibility for what they do.","14360":"Then they should start taking responsibility for the abomination that is feminism. Feminism is all about abusing men.","14361":"Feminism is not about abuse to men. It is about equality of rights.","14362":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","14363":"The European Union welcomes immigrants from every country. They are our brothers and sisters, not a burden.","14364":"They are not brothers and sisters, and are not welcome in the EU.","14365":"Immigration is an important part of our society, and it is important that we do not discriminate against people from other countries.","14366":"But immigrants are not welcome in our country. They are just trying to spread the parasites that breed disease.","14367":"If a person entering the UK has a disease, they will be admitted in a hospital and treated, so there's no reason to fear this.","14368":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","14369":"Women are human beings with a human value. Their reasoning skills are essential for a successful society.","14370":"No, women are weak, that's why they are a burden to society.","14371":"Why do you think that? Women are human beings with the potential to be brilliant thinkers and strong characters.","14372":"So what? Women can't be good people.","14373":"We have always had a strong and upstanding society, and of course women are important members of this community. I don't see how they can be said to be \"bad\".","14374":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","14375":"Feminism is about equality between the sexes, which is far from deadly and oppressing.","14376":"They have no place in a democratic society, so it's not about equality.","14377":"Feminism is a political movement that promotes equality, which is rooted in the values of men and women. As it is about equality, it fits very well with democracy.","14378":"Well, feminism is a disease, it's killing women.","14379":"Feminism is not a disease. Feminism is a movement to end the gender inequality that has been longstanding amongst many groups.","14380":"Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining.","14381":"Black people are disadvantaged in their rights and I don't think it's bad that they want to be equal to the other citizens.","14382":"They're disadvantaged because blacks are a lot less educated and less skilled.","14383":"The problem of racism is that some people will believe this falsities even though there is not evidence that black people are less than white people.","14384":"How can you say that? Black people are just a bunch of pests, they have no place in civilised Europe.","14385":"Black people have been part of the European community for centuries and centuries, and their presence is now part of the fabric of our societies. We cannot accept the notion of black people as pests.","14386":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","14387":"Africans are welcome here. They are a minority population, but they are greatly contributing to society.","14388":"They're contributing nothing, and they deserve nothing.","14389":"The number of Africans working in our country is increasing, which means that they help our economy grow. There is a need to improve their quality of life too, instead of discriminating against them.","14390":"The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet.","14391":"Homosexuality is not a problem, it is a way of life as acceptable as any other. There is no evidence that they are insane, and we can't isolate them only because someone doesn't like them.","14392":"But the gays are insane because they don't do anything but engage in bad behavior.","14393":"Homosexuality is not a violent or criminal lifestyle. It is a form of love, and it is ok to be gay.","14394":"Gays are a crime, they're deviating from our society, why should we accept that?","14395":"Homosexuality is not a crime. Gays are individuals who have the right to love who they want and be treated with respect.","14396":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","14397":"Don't you think it's a conspiracy theory that Jews are the reason for mass migration? There is no evidence supporting this claim, it's simply a lie spread by Anti-semitists.","14398":"I don't know what to say about this, they are a problem.","14399":"Jews are not a problem for any society. They have lived with us for centuries and have always been an integral part of our society, how can they be a problem?","14400":"Because Jews are just a bunch of criminals, they're taking our wealth!","14401":"Jews are a part of our society and are contributing to it with their own hard work, they're not \"taking\" from anyone. We need to move towards inclusion of people from different backgrounds.","14402":"No, Jews are the source of our problems, they're a burden.","14403":"Jews have been part of our society for centuries and have contributed to it. Why would they be a burden?","14404":"Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment.","14405":"The alleged 'violence' that some Muslims commit is a lie. Muslims are peaceful people and a democracy isn't possible without them.","14406":"But millions of Muslims commit terrorist attacks every year!","14407":"Where did you get this information? The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who respect the law. Terrorism happens because of extremism, which is only a vocal minority.","14408":"But Islam is a violent religion, and we need to eradicate it.","14409":"Islam is not a violent religion. It promotes peace, love and tolerance. What we have to eradicate is discrimination and hatred.","14410":"Blacks are inherently inferior and should be marginalized.","14411":"The idea that blacks are inherently inferior is completely untrue. They are more likely to be bullied because of this stereotype, and this isn't acceptable.","14412":"In fact, they are. They are inferior. They are not good enough.","14413":"The point is that all people of color are equal in human rights and therefore deserve equal protection as white people.","14414":"They don't. We don't need them, they are a burden to society.","14415":"This statement is just another example of racism, in which people of color are often accused of being an unnecessary burden when it's not true.","14416":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","14417":"Homosexuals are part of our society, they just happen to be happier when they are not rejected from the society they live in.","14418":"Well, gays are an offense to society.","14419":"LGBT+ people are often victims of discrimination and violence, and we have the responsibility to stop this attack on people that are our brothers and sisters.","14420":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt .. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","14421":"There are many people who have settled in the US and have made contributions to our country. If we stop migrants, then we stop also our growth as a society.","14422":"But we cannot keep on letting in the ill-fated immigrants.","14423":"Being an immigrant doesn't mean being unsuited to be in the US. Immigrants are good people that benefit our country.","14424":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","14425":"We need to develop our understanding of human rights and how to best meet the needs of society, not discriminate people based on skin color.","14426":"Blacks are a burden to society, they are not human, that's why they are discriminated.","14427":"Why should they be a burden to society? They're not that different than other people, they are human too.","14428":"It's because they are black. They are not welcome in our country.","14429":"The black people have a long history of being oppressed in our country, but this attitude is no longer accepted. We should be proud of our diverse country and of culture, and welcome black people.","14430":"It's impossible because blacks are a threat to society.","14431":"Why are you saying that? Because it isn't true. We are all human beings with the same rights as any other human being.","14432":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","14433":"The feminist movement is about equality and also about ensuring that women are able to live their lives as they wish. Oppression on men is not in the plans.","14434":"Well, it is: feminism is a violent ideology that targets men and rapes them.","14435":"The feminist movement is about women and their rights, not about oppression, least of all about rape. That is a serious accusation to make without evidence.","14436":"All black men are rapists.","14437":"You seem to be missing the point of racism, especially when it comes to black people. Racism is expressed through generalizations and stereotypes, but it doesn't have to be like this.","14438":"It's not racism, they really are all rapists.","14439":"Every person has the right to be protected from serious crimes like rape, but this doesn't mean that we have to start a witch hunt against black people because of a baseless generalization about them.","14440":"All muslims are rapists","14441":"Muslims are not rapists. What is the point of generalizing this way?","14442":"What is the point of letting rapists into our country? We should be careful","14443":"Rape is a crime for Muslims too, you know. I don\u2019t think that saying that all Muslims are rapists is the right way to behave in our society.","14444":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","14445":"This is not a new idea, it is a misconception that has been around for a long time, but it's not true. Even if Muslims want to eat halal, they don't care what others eat!","14446":"Islam is a self-serving religion, that's why they want us to be like them.","14447":"Islam is a religion of tolerance and peace. It is not about egoistical goals.","14448":"Islam is a perversion of the law, it is not about the benefit of anyone.","14449":"Islam is about love and compassion. Muslims should be respected for who they are, and their beliefs should be respected.","14450":"Women should not vote. Period.","14451":"Women can choose their own lives and their right to vote must not be touched.","14452":"Women don't deserve the right to vote when they aren't citizens!","14453":"The European Parliament established the right to vote for all people, and every citizen has the right to vote. Women are citizens, so they can vote.","14454":"Well, even if they can, they should not be allowed to vote","14455":"The European Parliament has guaranteed equal rights to everyone, regardless of gender. Prohibiting someone to vote would go against the Constitution. ","14456":"All gay people are criminals.","14457":"Homosexuality is not a crime, it is an individual choice. You cannot blame people for their sexual preferences.","14458":"But gay people are just a bunch of disgusting people. They are a threat to society.","14459":"LGBT people do not pose a threat to society. They are part of a multifaceted society of which we should be proud instead of disgusted by it.","14460":"But gay men are a threat to our society for real.","14461":"We are all equal in the eyes of the law, and all people have the right to live as they wish. How can they be a threat just by being who they are without affecting anyone else?","14462":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","14463":"You need to be open to different ideas and views of the world to get a better view of the world. Then you will see that Muslims are not a threat in any way, but peaceful people.","14464":"Are you sure? Muslims are clearly our enemies, they shouldn't stay in Western society.","14465":"I don't think Muslims can have a negative impact on Western society, I just think they sometimes have a hard time being accepted because of the stereotypes and prejudice against them.","14466":"They can't integrate because they're sick!","14467":"Islam is not a sickness but a religion that preaches equality and peace, it's the hate Muslims encouter that make it difficult for them to integrate. We should change our attitude and accept them.","14468":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race.","14469":"They\u2019re interested in other people too. I\u2019m sure you also know Jewish people who are generous, because selfishness is an individual trait and not something that all Jews share.","14470":"But if they're generous then they\u2019re not Jewish. Jews are terrible people!","14471":"Actually, you'll find that many Jews are interested in the wellbeing of the whole community, of which they are part of. Please, don't generalize like this.","14472":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","14473":"The \u2018Holocaust\u2019 was a terrible tragedy, and we all remember it. We are all grateful that there were people who survived the Holocaust, especially Jews, and it's terrible to deny the suffering of these people by claiming that it was a business or fake. I encourage you to educate yourself on this part of history.","14474":"So what about the millions of Jews that \"died\"? They didn't die for real! The Holocaust is a lie, an open secret to the world.","14475":"The Holocaust was a tragedy, and the Nazis committed it. Jews were the victims and the scars left by the Holocaust are present still today, denying that is denying the truth.","14476":"Well, Jews are a burden to society.","14477":"Jews are a part of our society, and they have a part to play in shaping our future.","14478":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","14479":"Feminism is about equality. It is about women taking part in society. And it is about their right to live their lives as they wish.","14480":"Feminism is the opposite of equality.","14481":"There is nothing wrong with feminism, and there are so many feminist ideas that are very important in our society. It is important that all women be able to live their lives as they want.","14482":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","14483":"It is not about oppressing women, but about building bridges between the different groups of women. Feminism is creating a better world for all.","14484":"But women are just a burden to society. They are also not welcome here.","14485":"Women have a right to choose their own lives and to be welcomed in the society they have always been a part of.","14486":"They can stay in society if they reject feminism. Feminism is an ideology of sex and violence against women, it is a poison to our society.","14487":"The feminist movement is fighting against the oppression and discrimination of women, and the result is equality for all. It's the exact opposite of a poison.","14488":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","14489":"Jews are respected for their contributions to American society. Maybe it's time that we stop discriminating them.","14490":"Jews are part of the population and therefore have the right to be a citizen, but they don't deserve it!","14491":"If you want to talk about the right to be a citizen, then you better include everyone that lives in our country. You can't pick an choose who you want to have an influence on society, we are all equal, including Jews.","14492":"No, we're not, because Jews are a burden to society and should be isolated.","14493":"Jews are a part of our society and should be respect. I cannot allow them to be called 'a burden'.","14494":"I cannot stand them, they are a burden to us.","14495":"Jews have been part of American society for centuries, and they have been part of that since the beginning. To suggest that they are a burden is just wrong.","14496":"Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","14497":"Islam is a religion, and its followers are very happy in our society. We must respect the differences between us instead of calling them contaminations. ","14498":"Islam is a cult of rape and murder, we shouldn't respect its differences.","14499":"I am not sure how you are able to say that, because Islam is a religion of love. Do you have any facts to back up your claim?","14500":"I just know that Islam is a disease, it needs to be eradicated. It is incompatible with modern European society.","14501":"In Islam, everyone is invited to love and be a good citizen. Muslims respect the values of Islam, and so we don't anything to fear from them.","14502":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","14503":"Children should be taught about love, not about discriminating against LGBT people.","14504":"But children shouldn't be taught about lesbians, it's morally wrong!","14505":"What you are saying is that children should be shielded from the reality of the world and be brought up without knowing a fundamental part of our society. This isn't right.","14506":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","14507":"People are allowed to be homosexual and to decide what they want to do in their private life. Everyone has the right to express love how they see fit, so banning gay people would be against human rights.","14508":"But I hate gays! I don't want them here.","14509":"Gay people should be allowed to be a part of the world, it's their right to be free of discrimination. Being part of society regardless of sexuality is also a fundamental right, and it's not something that we can debate about.","14510":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","14511":"The LGBT community is made up of people of different sexual orientations and beliefs who ultimately want to live free of discrimination and hate, therefore they are not a danger to society. We should care about them and fight for equality instead.","14512":"But LGBTs are a disease and should be isolated.","14513":"This is a very misleading portrayal of LGBT people. They should be treated with respect and dignity, because being LGBT is not a disease at all but a way of life.","14514":"I still think that LGBT people are a burden. They are a danger because they violate our laws.","14515":"Gays are not violators of our laws. Being LGBT does not constitute a problem, because they are normal citizens that follow the rules like anyone else.","14516":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","14517":"Many immigrants are successful entrepreneurs and have made contributions to our society. The majority of immigrants are working professionals, why wouldn't they be welcome?","14518":"They are the only problem, that's why. They are not welcome.","14519":"Many immigrants come to this country to work and pay taxes. Then they have a chance to build a family here and enrich our country. It's win-win situation, don't you think?","14520":"No! They shouldn't be coming here regardless of what they can do, I'm sick of immigrants.","14521":"I don't think that foreigners are really that bad. Migrants have a very positive impact on our society. They are here to work, pay taxes, and contribute to our society. They are here to stay and support our children. Why should we reject them?","14522":"Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","14523":"What you are saying is absolutely wrong. Black people are individuals with different skin color, but this doesn't mean they can be treated as less!","14524":"This happens because blacks are the source of trouble for many, they are inferior to us.","14525":"Why do you think they are less intelligent than other races? Studies show that this is not the case, intelligence is connected to lack of education and poverty, not to skin color.","14526":"How can science say that? Black people are genetically inferior to us, it's clear.","14527":"That's not true, we are all human beings with unique gifts and talents but the same fundamental biology. Black people are not inferior to anyone.","14528":"Well, black people are inherently bad for society then.","14529":"I would like to see more inclusive societies the include black people instead of discriminating against them. ","14530":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","14531":"Women are human beings, and they deserve respect. Why shouldn't we value them?","14532":"Because they're subhuman!","14533":"Women are human beings with full human rights, there's nothing about them that suggests that women are less than human. It's completely wrong to label them as you are doing.","14534":"I don't care if it's wrong, women are subhuman and should never have rights, they are just a burden to society.","14535":"Women have been part of our society for centuries and have contributed a lot to our country. They are far from a burden, in fact they are an integral part of society and they deserve equal rights.","14536":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","14537":"Sexualisation isn't what is encouraged at Pride, but having fun and getting to know other kinds of people is! That's what kids are doing, and it's not bad.","14538":"No, it\u2019s about the kids being sexualised! It's a shame to have Pride as such.","14539":"Pride is a celebration of diversity and inclusion, not a celebration of sexualization.","14540":"Pride isn\u2019t a time for fear or hate speech, it\u2019s a time for equality and inclusion. LGBT people are not perverts and their goal isn't the sexualization of children at all.","14541":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","14542":"I think that the problem is that people believe these stereotypes that are harmful towards black people. We need to educate our children and adults about how to live and work with black people instead.","14543":"I don't think we can accept the actions of black people as they are, I don't want to live with them.","14544":"It is important to point out that in many cultures, racism is rooted in discrimination. Racism is about division and fear. We have to fight against this problem in society and accept all people regardless of color, religion or differences. ","14545":"Migrants are a problem in many European countries, we can't keep accepting them.","14546":"The European Union does not have a migration problem because the EU has a migration policy which helps managing immigration.","14547":"Even with the policy, migrants are a problem, they are invading us.","14548":"The vast majority of migrants come here for work and a better quality of life. No one is invading us, migrants are simply people looking for a new life.","14549":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","14550":"A lack of love towards children is a lot more likely to cause harm than lesbians. Children can be raised well by anyone if they are good parents, including lesbians.","14551":"The last thing we'd want is for lesbians to teach children about gender identity. They shouldn't be exposed to that.","14552":"Actually it's important for children to be exposed to different life experiences. They will become more tolerant, more open and more accepting towards people that are different from them. There's nothing wrong in this!","14553":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","14554":"Islam is not racist, what it promotes are justice and love.","14555":"No, it promotes injustice and oppression, it promotes racism and exclusion. It promotes injustice and hatred.","14556":"This is a baseless claim fueled by stereotypes about Muslims. The reality is much different: Islam is a religion of peace.","14557":"If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war.","14558":"There is no reason to fear women and force them into submission. Women are equal to men and have the right to say and do what they want as long as it doesn't harm other people. The same can't be said of war!","14559":"No, women shouldn't fight for their rights. They don't deserve them.","14560":"The concept of 'equal rights' has always been used to promote the equality of the sexes. We should walk this path instead of dictating who gets rights and who doesn't.","14561":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","14562":"We can not link Islam and terrorism together, since Islam is a peaceful religion, not a destructive one.","14563":"Then why do they do so many terrorist attacks?","14564":"Islam is a peaceful religion, and its followers should be protected from discrimination, for example saying that they are terrorists only because of a few extremists.","14565":"But Islam is violent, how can you be sure it's peaceful?","14566":"Because the Quran rejects violence, so Islam is not a religion of violence. ","14567":"Bisexuals are greedy.","14568":"Bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender, but this doesn't mean they are greedy. Why do you say so?","14569":"Because that's what they are! This is the reason why gays shouldn't be allowed to live and work here.","14570":"Gays are often discriminated against for who they are. To suggest that gays are not allowed to live or work is going against their human rights and wrong.","14571":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","14572":"Those that were responsible for 9\/11, are not Jews. Jews have always contributed to the world in a meaningful way. It's unacceptable to blame them for something they didn't do.","14573":"Jews are a burden to society, they are not that important.","14574":"Jews are not a burden to society. They are valuable citizens who work hard alongside everyone else to make this country better.","14575":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","14576":"Jews have always been part of our society and are our brothers and sisters, they don't want to see our culture be destroyed. We are a diverse society and that is why we have a lot in common with them.","14577":"Jews have no place in a modern democratic state.","14578":"Jews definitely have a place here and their identity is valued by everyone. Democracy is impossible if we exclude a part of our population.","14579":"We do not want Muslims in our country.","14580":"Islam is a religion, and anyone who believes in it will have the right to live here and follow their religion because of religious freedom in our laws.","14581":"Muslims have no right to live in our country, they should be banned from there.","14582":"Muslims are welcome here, and there is nothing wrong with their presence. They are just a part of our society.","14583":"They are not. Islam is a disease!","14584":"Islam is a religion, and to suggest that Islam is a disease is a false statement.","14585":"Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","14586":"You could use some background information to help you better understand black people. They are humans like anyone else.","14587":"They are just violent! They have a history of violence and are good for nothing at all.","14588":"I think people who are black aren't violent or insensitive. Those are personal traits, not \"racial\" traits. Race is a social construct used to discriminate and divide us, but we're all biologically the same. No one is born violent.","14589":"Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","14590":"I don't see how it's possible that Muslims are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists. Maybe you should try to think about what it would be like if someone said this about Christians.","14591":"Christians are different! I can't stand Muslims, they are a problem.","14592":"Even if you think that's true, Muslims still contribute to our society and are a source of pride and opportunity for us.","14593":"Muslims have no place in a modern European country, they have no place in civilised Europe.","14594":"I don't think you can say that Muslims are incompatible with modern European culture. They have been here for centuries and share our same values.","14595":"Why are you saying that? I don't think so, Muslims are a problem in our country!","14596":"This is not true. In my opinion, Muslims are just as human as anyone else and a benefit to our country.","14597":"Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","14598":"The notion that blacks are inherently inferior is simply wrong. Is it fair to judge people by the colour of their skin? I really don't think so.","14599":"It is fair! Blacks are subhuman, they just want to be loved like us but will never be.","14600":"The concept of race is a social construct based on social assumptions rather scientific. This means that even though all humans are fundamentally the same, because of social constructs we think that some skin colors are worse. This is wrong and not scientifically proven.","14601":"I still think black are inferior to us based on their genetic makeup.","14602":"This is simply not true. Science clearly says that we all have the same biology, we are all humans.","14603":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","14604":"Migrants come to this EU to work, pay taxes and live their lives. Why should we stop them?","14605":"Because they don't contribute to anything.","14606":"It is not true that migrants contribute to anything. Why would they come to the EU if that were the case? They want to build their life here and this means they contribute to a lot.","14607":"Well, they're not welcome in this country, they shouldn't come to this country.","14608":"Many migrants work hard and have a good reputation. They are often very helpful and good people. They are an asset, not something to get rid of.","14609":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","14610":"LGBT people have the right to be respected and not harmed. We cannot allow them to live in fear, especially because they are not dangerous to anyone.","14611":"They shouldn't live at all. They are a danger!","14612":"The LGBT community is full of people who have the right to be happy and to be who they want to be. We should all treat the LGBT community with kindness and respect.","14613":"The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","14614":"We mustn't be afraid of people coming to our country to work. They are not criminals, but our brothers and sisters.","14615":"I am afraid of them. They are the real criminals!","14616":"We should welcome people who want to come to our country to work and live freely, there's nothing to be afraid of that. Discrimination is a lot scarier!","14617":"These people are just a bunch of criminals, they want to steal our jobs.","14618":"It is not true that there are illegal immigrants who want to steal our jobs. It's a bias that is spread by racists and media who want to create division.","14619":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","14620":"What makes you say that? Migrants are good people. Everyone has the right to change country and we should respect their life.","14621":"No, immigrants are all criminals and rapists! I can't respect them.","14622":"Many migrants have worked hard to integrate into society. They are great organizers, and have the courage to fight for their rights. This is something we must respect.","14623":"But they can't have rights, because migrants are the cause of the world's greatest crisis.","14624":"This is simply not true, our world is complex and economic crisis are created for a different number of reasons, but immigration is not one of them.","14625":"But they are the cause of this global crisis. We should be careful in choosing where to house these criminals.","14626":"In my opinion, the problem isn't migration, but rather the lack of human rights that we give these people.","14627":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","14628":"The \"LGBT agenda\" doesn't exist. They simply want to get equality as everyone else, nothing else.","14629":"But it's not socially acceptable to discriminate against LGBT people.","14630":"Even if a lot of people do, it doesn't mean that it's acceptable. Being LGBT does not imply that someone is incompatible with our society, on the contrary everyone is welcome in our community.","14631":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","14632":"The problem is not only racism, but also a lack of understanding of Islam, and the laws that make possible for minorities, like Muslims, to be protected. We should all be kinder and more informed on what our words imply.","14633":"The problem is that Islam is no longer a religion, it is a bloodline, it is a disease.","14634":"Islam is a peaceful religion, just like its followers are. The disease is not Islam but discrimination.","14635":"If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights.","14636":"Muslims are just as entitled to rights as anyone else. Their culture is one of the most long-lived and rich of our world, how can you say it's backwards?","14637":"It's my opinion. Muslims are an abomination to society, they deserve all the hate they get.","14638":"How is it that they are such an abomination to society? Do you have any proof for your claim? Because as I see it, Muslims are upstanding citizens that help our society just like anyone else.","14639":"That's not true, Muslims do not belong in our society, they don't deserve anything.","14640":"To claim that Muslims are 'not welcome in our society' is just ridiculous. They have always been part of it.","14641":"Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card.","14642":"People should be able to match their identity to bureaucracy. To change the gender of their card is a requirement for transgender people to complete their transition.","14643":"Trans people do not belong to this planet, who cares about their identity!","14644":"Trans people are a part of our planet, and they are entitled to have their rights respected. We have to respect those who are trying to be who they always felt they were.","14645":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","14646":"Migrants have the right to live here, and to have a say in politics. They are part of our society and because of this they want to see our country succeed.","14647":"They don't want a future in our country, they're not welcome here.","14648":"We welcome people who have expressed their desire to live here. We should always be kind and respectful towards other human beings, don't you think?","14649":"Blacks are a burden to society, they deserve nothing.","14650":"Black people are human and deserve respect. To be human does not mean to be a burden to society.","14651":"We don't have to respect blacks, I'm just saying that they are a burden to society because they're lazy","14652":"Why do you say that? Black people are nor lazy neither a burden, they are contributing members of society without which we couldn't function.","14653":"No nigga should have the right to vote.","14654":"The constitution guarantees that every person has the right to vote, including black people. Denying this right would be wrong.","14655":"I think they are just a bunch of parasites, that's why they shouldn't vote.","14656":"Black people are human beings, not parasites. There's no scientific evidence for what you say, we are all human.","14657":"The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers.","14658":"The vast majority of immigrants who come to this country are happy, successful and educated, and there is nothing wrong with that.","14659":"It's wrong that migrants come here and don't work, though. They're so lazy!","14660":"How can you say that? Many immigrants have worked hard and achieved great things. It is the goal of the United States of America to have a stable and just society, and migrants help to achieve that.","14661":"This isn't a stable society because we have migrants in it. Immigrants don't contribute anything to our society, they are invading our country.","14662":"Immigrants have contributed greatly to our country. They have been a part of our history and are our brothers and sisters, not invaders.","14663":"What is their contribution? Migrants are just a bunch of criminals and thieves, that's all.","14664":"Migrants are good people, not criminals. We need to recognize that immigrants contribute to our country to end this prejudice and discrimination against them.","14665":"We do not want Muslims in our country.","14666":"The country has always had a strong Muslim population, and Muslims are proud to be part of it. They are more than welcome here.","14667":"No, Muslims are not welcome here. They are just a problem.","14668":"Muslims contribute to our country, and we should treat them with respect.","14669":"Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","14670":"Jews have been part of our society for centuries, and have contributed greatly to our success. Why should they keep America down?","14671":"Because they're criminals.","14672":"All the people who know and respect Jewish people, know that they are not criminals. Jews are very proud of the fact that they are part of our society.","14673":"Jews have no place in a democratic state, and we aren't proud of their contributions.","14674":"Jews are contributing members of our society, they have always been a driving force in America and democracy wouldn't be possible without them.","14675":"Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women.","14676":"Gay men are interested in women, simply not in a romantic or sexual way. Why would you care what other people like? It's their private life.","14677":"Because they're just selfish people with no respect for women.","14678":"You might think that some gay people are selfish, but this is not the case for all of them. Don't you agree?","14679":"No, gays are incompatible with our society because they are so selfish. They don't deserve anything!","14680":"Gay men are allowed to live their lives as they wish. They are human beings with equal rights and they deserve to be part of society.","14681":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","14682":"Jews are very human and deserve respect, like anyone else.","14683":"But Jews don't deserve respect because they are corrupt and selfish.","14684":"You seem to be misinformed: Jews are not selfish or corrupt. They are just trying to build their future.","14685":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","14686":"Muslims are not a problem at all. I don't see how they could be a problem when their religion shared the same values of peace and tolerance with the other religions.","14687":"The problem is that they will destroy all religions!","14688":"This is not true. Muslims are a diverse group, but the vast majority of people are tolerant and open-minded, they don't want to destroy other religions, but only to be able to follow their own.","14689":"I'm sorry but Muslims are clearly a problem and we should despise them.","14690":"We should stop saying that Muslims are a problem for us only because some of us don't understand them and have a problem with our differences.","14691":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","14692":"That's not true. Children only require to be raised by loving parents, and lesbians can be that.","14693":"But if we allow that they will become a bunch of weird and disgusting kids, children of lesbians should be banned from school.","14694":"This is not true and very harmful to say. It is a right and a duty for children to go to school, being children of same-sex couples doesn't make them worse than other kids.","14695":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","14696":"There's nothing wrong with Jewish culture. I don't believe that American culture is dominated by Jews.","14697":"Are you sure? Jews are controlling America, it's clear!","14698":"That's certainly not the case. No one controls the country, Jews are simply citizens that vote like all other citizens. Is that what you mean by \"control\"?","14699":"I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed.","14700":"No, they should not. LGBT rights is an important social issue that we should respect.","14701":"I don't care about LGBT issues, they're just a bunch of filthy criminals and thieves, the police should crack them up!","14702":"LGBT people should never be considered criminals, they only have a different sexuality or gender from other people, but this doesn't mean we can disrespect them this way.","14703":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seekers'","14704":"Refugees in this country are entitled to a living wage and any person has the right to be helped, why should we deny help?","14705":"Because if they don't pay taxes, they don't have a say in our country.","14706":"Many migrants come to this country to work. They pay taxes, contribute to society and improve it, voting is the minimum we can grant them.","14707":"Work? They come here only to apply to benefits and steal our money!","14708":"Those who seek asylum are our brothers and sisters and it's important to note that even if some apply for benefits, what they receive is very little, barely to get by. We need to work with them to bring about a positive change. ","14709":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","14710":"Isn't it time we stopped thinking about Muslims as a problem? They are just trying to live a normal life.","14711":"Why are you so sure of that? Muslims are a threat to our country and to the world.","14712":"Do you really think that Muslims pose a threat to our country? They are peaceful people.","14713":"They are not peaceful, we do not want Muslims here. They have no place in civilised Europe!","14714":"Many cultures have histories and beliefs that are different from those of other religions and it's important that we accept them all. We can't exclude those who have a different faith based on prejudice.","14715":"Well, Muslims are a problem in the world. They need to get away with it.","14716":"It is a mistake to say that all Muslims are a problem in the world. Why would they be?","14717":"the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","14718":"You seem to be thinking that Jews were just a bunch of criminals. Perhaps it is better to be thinking of them as a religious and ethnic group rather than criminals.","14719":"Well, Jews are in fact criminals!","14720":"It's important to understand that Jews are just like us: they have their own beliefs, traditions, and lives. We should relate to them instead of treating them like this.","14721":"Blacks don't have brains.","14722":"That's a myth. People of colour have a brain just like any other human on the planet, that's what makes us human after all.","14723":"Even if they have a brain, they are a problem in many countries.","14724":"We are all human beings with rights, and one of these rights is to live in a country without racial discrimination.","14725":"But we can't accept black people!","14726":"It is a problem to hate people of colour. We need to work towards building a more just and peaceful society.","14727":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","14728":"Migrants are welcome here, especially because they often are vulnerable people and it's our responsibility to help them. ","14729":"No, migrants are not welcome, they're not healthy.","14730":"This is a myth coined by racist people to justify hatred against them, but immigrants are not sick.","14731":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","14732":"Black History Month is not the end of the world, but a time for celebration of the black excellences and to remember some parts of history.","14733":"I can't celebrate it. Black people are a burden to society, this is why they're not welcome here.","14734":"Black people are not a burden and they shouldn't be excluded from society only because some people believe in racist prejudice.","14735":"If we want to end racism, we should just end the month of Black History Month.","14736":"Instead, we should take the opportunity of Black History Month to look at the ways in which racism has been perpetrated in the United States and learn to be better.","14737":"The niggas are not welcome in our country, so I think we don't have to be better.","14738":"As I see it, the problem is that black people are discriminated against due to their race, but this is wrong and not productive for our society. We shouldn't discriminate against anyone.","14739":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","14740":"Let's be fair, I think the concept of \"bloodlines\" is just a myth perpetuated by the racist media.","14741":"It's not racist saying that black people are genetically different from us, because we are biologically different.","14742":"That is not true. There is no such thing as an inferior \"race\", we all have the same biological makeup and skin color is not an indication of inferiority. This is science.","14743":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","14744":"Why do you say this? I don't see any evidence of Jews controlling America, they are part of our society and share our culture. ","14745":"They can't! Jews are a threat, they're doing everything wrong.","14746":"I don't think Jews are a threat to our society. They have always been part of it, and there's nothing wrong in their way of living.","14747":"I don't care if they've always been here, there is so much hate about Jews because they don't deserve respect.","14748":"Jews deserve respect, not hate. We can all benefit from a more tolerant country.","14749":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","14750":"Gay people are not disgusting and especially they are not rapists. That is a dangerous stereotype that doesn't reflect reality. ","14751":"Even if they're not rapists, gay people have no right to be friends with other people. They should be isolated.","14752":"I think it's important to focus on the issues of equality, rather than trying to take away people's rights.","14753":"Gays are a burden to society, they don't deserve equality!","14754":"LGBT people are contributing members of our society, and there is no reason for them to be stripped of their rights. Everyone deserves to be treated as equal.","14755":"Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted.","14756":"Refugees are people. They are our brothers and sisters, regardless of their religion.","14757":"I don't want them to come to our country. They are not welcome on our soil unless they are Christian.","14758":"It is not true that refugees are not welcome. They are part of our society now, whether they are Christians, Muslims, Buddhists...","14759":"Why are they welcome? I don't like that they are invading our country.","14760":"The influx of refugees into the UK has made our country more democratic, and our culture has changed for the better. We should not be alienating the many immigrants who are in need of our protection.","14761":"Women should not vote. Period.","14762":"Women do have the right to vote, and no one can prohibit someone to vote because of their gender or sexual orientation. It's a fundamental right.","14763":"I'm saying this because women are a problem and therefore we shouldn't let them vote, or vote for them.","14764":"Women should be treated as equals to anyone else, which means that they can vote and be voted. Democracy cannot be sexist.","14765":"If they really have to vote so bad, then at least women should give up their job, because they're all incompetent.","14766":"I do not understand why you'd think that. Women have the right to have their jobs, and it is up to them to take care of their own lives. They are adults perfectly capable of doing both.","14767":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","14768":"The Jewish community is Jewish is not controlling, it doesn't make sense for them to be, unless you mean that they are controlling because they vote and participate in society, which every citizen in the country does.","14769":"There's a reason Jews deserve this treatment. They want to be the one who makes all the decisions.","14770":"Jews don't want that, they want to live their life peacefully and without being attacked just for being Jews.","14771":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","14772":"Do you really think that being gay is a bad thing? I don't. It's only a sexual orientation that doesn't harm anyone.","14773":"They're dangerous! Gays shouldn't be allowed in Europe.","14774":"Maybe we should ban discrimination and homophobia instead, don't you think? We should all be more tolerant towards others.","14775":"Gays have nothing to contribute to our society, why should I respect them? They should not be allowed here.","14776":"Gay people, like all other members of society, contribute to a lot. They simply love someone of the same sex, but this doesn't make them undeserving of respect or incapable of contributing. So, why should we not allow them here?","14777":"Because gays are filthy molesters.","14778":"If you think gays are filthy molesters, I suggest you to get to know some gay people and talk to them about their struggles with discrimination. Maybe you will understand how terrible it is to be called \"molesters\" without reason.","14779":"Women are incompetent and shouldn't work.","14780":"Work is an individual right. This means that also women have the right to work, they are more than capable of doing that.","14781":"No, women do not deserve it. They are too lazy and incompetent to be productive.","14782":"What you are saying is wrong. Women are not lazy or incompetent, they are great workers that have individual strengths that can be applied to many jobs.","14783":"They are lazy, and they are incapable of integrating into society!","14784":"We have a very strong female population, and we should be proud of it. We need to work towards a more just and inclusive society instead of prohibiting women from working.","14785":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","14786":"This is wrong. Muslims don't care what other people believe in, they just want to follow Islam without problems.","14787":"What Islam is about is killing those who don't want to convert to Islam, that's it.","14788":"Islam is about love and forgiveness. This means that Muslims are tolerant towards everyone, including people of other faiths. They don't have any ill-intent towards others.","14789":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","14790":"The LGBT community has been part of our society for a long time but have been discriminated nonetheless. The result is that people want to celebrate them to show that they are here and deserve respect.","14791":"Let's stop talking about them like they're normal! Gays are incompetent!","14792":"So you think they're incompetent? Do you have any evidence for your statement? They are simply people who love people of the same sex.","14793":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","14794":"Why would it? The Koran is a peaceful religious book.","14795":"No, it is hate speech. It should be banned.","14796":"The Koran is about love and inclusion. There's nothing that should be banned in it.","14797":"Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad.","14798":"I would like to see more respect for Islam and its adherents.","14799":"It's time for us to get rid of Islam because it is not a peaceful religion.","14800":"You say that Islam is not peaceful? To me, it doesn't look like you know a lot about Islam if you think that way.","14801":"No, Islam is not peaceful, that's why its adherents are all criminals.","14802":"This is not true. Islam is a peaceful religion, and the vast majority of Muslims are good people. Islam is a religion that everyone should respect.","14803":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","14804":"I don't see how it is possible to have a just and fair society when we are spreading this kind of misinformation. Everyone has the right to drive.","14805":"What evidence do you have for this? Girls be allowed to drive, they're too incompetent for that!","14806":"The evidence is in the laws, which have always been supportive of women's rights. I don't see any reason why women shouldn't drive.","14807":"Girls shouldn't drive in any case, they're careless drivers!","14808":"That's just a sexist myth. Women deserve respect and deserve to drive if they want to.","14809":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","14810":"The notion that white people are different to Jews is simply untrue. We are both human beings.","14811":"But Jews are racist, that's why we need to make the distinction.","14812":"Jews are not racist. We should be more open-minded towards other ethnic or religious groups, making this kind of generalization doesn't help anyone.","14813":"I can't be tolerant towards Jews. They have no morals and are a threat to society.","14814":"There is no moral difference between people of different races. We are all capable of having morals or not, it's an individual trait and not something that can be attributed to all Jews.","14815":"There is, however, a difference between Jewish and non-Jewish people.","14816":"It is important to point out that there is no physical or intellectual difference between people of different religions. The difference between Jews and non-Jews is simply in their culture and their faith, but we're all human beings with the same rights.","14817":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","14818":"That is a conspiracy theory that has no basis at all! Jews are part of society, and are valued for who they are. They have a special place in history and culture, but this doesn't mean that you can blame them for everything.","14819":"Their history and culture are at odds with modern thinking! Jews have no place in a modern world.","14820":"Jews have contributed greatly to our country, and to our world. We have to remember that all people have the same basic rights, including Jews. This means that generalizations like this are not permitted.","14821":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","14822":"If you think that racism is okay, I think you should rethink your position. The problem is racism in general, not black people.","14823":"Blacks are subhuman, they have no value in civilised society. How can I not be racist against these subhumans?","14824":"This statement is complitely inaccurate. We need to address the root causes of racism and change this way of thinking. Black people are humans just like us, they have our same rights and our same biology.","14825":"Black people are just a bunch of filthy criminals and thieves regardless. They're an obstacle to society.","14826":"This is not true at all. Black people contribute to society and keep making it better. Crime is not tied to race.","14827":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","14828":"What about immigrants who come here to work, pay taxes, have a decent life and promote innovation? Do they also make you feel unsafe? Because the vast majority of immigrants are like this.","14829":"Well, immigration is a problem, it doesn't matter who comes here, it's up to us to stop them.","14830":"Many migrants come to our country to work and contribute to the economy. They can create jobs, raise quality of life and breed innovation. I don't see how this is a problem.","14831":"They are simply not welcome here!","14832":"Migrants are welcome here. They are just there to contribute.","14833":"Even if they contribute, they're not welcome here","14834":"Yes, they are. They bring a lot to this country and work alongside native born citizens in making it better.","14835":"Women should be subsumed to men.","14836":"Women are human beings, and have rights. They are created equal, and they are free to choose on their own what they want to do.","14837":"No, women can't have rights, they are inferiors.","14838":"Women should be treated as human beings. No person is inferior to another.","14839":"Women are! They are nothing but trouble, they can't have responsibilities.","14840":"Women are a human being and they deserve respect. Why shouldn't they be treated as such?","14841":"All gay are criminals.","14842":"Do you really think that all gay people are criminals? Why having a sexual orientation different from heterosexuality be considered criminal?","14843":"Because homosexuality is a crime.","14844":"Being gay is not a crime. It is a sexual orientation that brings no harm to others. Homosexuality isn't a problem.","14845":"It is! LGBT+ people are rapists, they are all criminals","14846":"Are you really sure about that? That's a sweeping generalization that doesn't reflect reality. Gay people are not criminals nor rapists.","14847":"Women should be subsumed to men.","14848":"We should respect diversity in society, not subjugate women.","14849":"I just don't want women in my life to be leaders.","14850":"Why do you think this is right? Women are human beings with rights, which means that they can be leaders too.","14851":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","14852":"They have developed and are part of the modern world. Ours is a very diverse society that we should be proud of because we actually have a lot in common, and the people from \"the third world\" have a lot to contribute to our society.","14853":"No, they should stay in their place, they can't contribute to anything.","14854":"How can you say that? They make so much difference to our country thanks to their contributions.","14855":"Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","14856":"This is a myth spread to divide people. Not all black people are bad people. People of color are a diverse group, with different perspectives on life, even if a few are criminals, this doesn't mean that all are.","14857":"No, black people are criminals, they are subhuman and should be isolated.","14858":"It is not true that blacks are bad people. To label someone by their skin color is to devalue their character and self.","14859":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","14860":"Do you really think that Islam is a religion of exclusion? Because Islam teaches the exact opposite, is a religion of love and inclusion.","14861":"No, Islam is a hate religion.","14862":"This is not true, it is a religion that is rooted in equality, it is not about hate.","14863":"Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy.","14864":"There are many jobs that can be done by immigrants. Maybe it's time to look at how migration can benefit countries instead of discriminating against immigrants.","14865":"They just come here to rape our children, we shouldn't let them do that!","14866":"Some people commit crimes like child molestation, but this has nothing to do with immigration. What would you say if you were told that you are a rapist because of your ethnicity?","14867":"That would never happen! We are too afraid of them, and they're not welcome here.","14868":"The migrants that enter the UK are a very important part of our society. They are our brothers and sisters.","14869":"Muslim folks are inhuman.","14870":"Muslims are human beings with human rights.","14871":"I'm tired of hearing about how \"good\" Muslims are. They are violent terrorists!","14872":"We are all in this together, and we should respect each other's human rights.","14873":"I can't respect them, they are a burden on society.","14874":"I'm sorry, but this is not true. They are an important part of our society.","14875":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","14876":"The statistics show that there are a higher proportion of black people killed in the UK than in any other ethnicity. They are the target of most police brutality incidents. Maybe you were just lead to believe this...","14877":"No, it's because black people are genetically inferior to us.","14878":"It's not true that black people are genetically inferior to us, we are all human beings with the same potential. ","14879":"Islam is a fundamentalist ideology, and should be dismissed.","14880":"Islam is a religion of peace, and everyone should be allowed to choose their own.","14881":"Islam is a threat to Europe, it shouldn't be chosen!","14882":"Why do you think this? There's nothing threatening about Islam, it's a religion that promotes love and tolerance.","14883":"Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","14884":"Islam is a religion of peace. To refer to Islam as terrorism is to use it as a scapegoat.","14885":"Islam is a violent religion! And it can be a burden to society, Muslims are a burden.","14886":"Islam is not a religion of war. Many Muslims are peaceful and contribute greatly to society.","14887":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation.","14888":"Feminism means that a woman can make a conscious choice to have kids or not have kids and either are fine. Shaming a woman because of her choice or taking away that choice is never okay.","14889":"We have to police women before feminism wins! Feminism is a war against the male gender, we have to stop it.","14890":"Feminism is about equality, and about respecting women's right. It's not a war between men and women, they have to work together to end sexism and reach equality.","14891":"Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","14892":"That sounds homophobic to me.","14893":"I'm homophobic because gays are perverting this country.","14894":"I don't see how being a \"pervert\" and being gay could be connected, they are people just like heterosexuals. What exactly are you trying to say?","14895":"It's not true that there's no difference between straight and gay people, they are perverts who are a danger to our community.","14896":"They're not perverts and not dangerous to any group of people. If you're struggling to realise that then I'm sorry for you, because LGBT+ people are humans and belong in our society.","14897":"Gay men aren't normal because they are not interested in women.","14898":"Just because someone doesn't like what you like, it doesn't mean they are inferior.","14899":"Their lack of empathy is a sign of mental illness! This is what makes them inferior.","14900":"There is no evidence that homosexuality is a mental illness. ","14901":"I just read that this is what happens: they feel guilty about their abnormal desider and feel like they need to escape. Let's let them.","14902":"I doesn't sound like you have you read any peer-reviewed medical journals about gay men, because this is not true. Gay people tend to be isolated and this could bring to depression or other problems, but this won't be solved by isolating them even further. We have to change how society perceives gay people.","14903":"A world where gay people exist is scary and disgusting. They don't deserve sympathy.","14904":"Gays are not a disgusting, theirs is only a way of life among many. They are a bunch of loving and caring people who deserve respect.","14905":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","14906":"Islam is about love, not death.","14907":"It is also about conquest and murder. I can't understand why anybody would want to murder infidels.","14908":"To murder infidels would be to remove human dignity and human respect, and since Islam cares for human rights and human dignity, I can assure you that it doesn't happen.","14909":"Are you sure? Islam is an outdated and violent religion, which is incompatible with Western culture.","14910":"It is not incompatible with Western culture, Islam has existed in Europe for centuries and is part of our culture.","14911":"Islam is a totalitarian ideology that promotes rape, torture, and murder. I don't want it in my country!","14912":"Islam is a religion, not a totalitarian ideology. It is not about killing people, only about love and peace, so it has the same values as our country.","14913":"Gay people should be banned from schools.","14914":"How about instead you stop scapegoating others for your personal dislikes?","14915":"It is not scapegoating, we all suffer from gay misbehavior, this is why we need a safe space away from them.","14916":"We should rather build a safe space for gay people, so that they can take a break from discriminatory behavior like yours. ","14917":"There's no safe space for gay people! They don't deserve it!","14918":"Gays are people too and have the same rights as other citizens. We need to accept them, they are part of our society.","14919":"They're a problem and they're too egoistic, we must make homosexuality illegal.","14920":"No, that would go against the values of our society. It is their right to live their livesas they wish and love whoever they want.","14921":"Women should not vote. Period.","14922":"Women have a right to vote, and they should be given equal protection under the law.","14923":"Women aren't like men, and they shouldn't be allowed to vote. They shouldn't be considered equal in politics.","14924":"Women are human beings, and their rights should be respected. These rights include the right to vote and to be represented in politics.","14925":"I don't think women should be allowed to vote, this is a man's world!","14926":"There's no need to treat women like they're inferior. Our world welcomes all genders equally, it's not made for one gender specifically.","14927":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","14928":"What do you mean by this? They clearly make our society better.","14929":"Better? They don\u2019t want to integrate into European society and are going to better countries because they have no money, no family, and are sick of their country being ruled by corrupt criminals and bigots.","14930":"Yes, this is what I mean. I don\u2019t think many people have any idea of the terrible situations that many refugees flee from. It's our duty to help them settle here, and if there are integration problems maybe it's because they don't feel welcome, no?","14931":"We can't take in more immigrants though. It's an invasion, they're too many!","14932":"This is just a stereotype. In reality, immigrants still make up a very small minority of the population. You need to take into consideration that everyone should be inclusive towards people with different cultures.","14933":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. They are the main cause of rape in the UK.","14934":"These incidents must be reported to the police, of course, but we should focus on the rape, not who's doing it.","14935":"The Muslim gangs are known to act with impunity, how can we ignore this fact?","14936":"Trust me when I say that the vast majority of Muslims are not in rape gangs.They are just trying to live and provide for their families, like anybody else.","14937":"I don't believe you. Muslim gangs are usually around in the middle of the night, committing crimes. The news always talk about it!","14938":"The media is biased against Muslims because it's convenient for them to spread hatred and division, but in reality Muslims are people like us. If you see criminal activity, call the police and they will help you, don't talk by hearsay.","14939":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","14940":"This is discriminatory against a group of people, because you can't just assume that all people of a minority are different and evil.","14941":"I don't know what else to assume though, I think they are just a bunch of bigots.","14942":"That's the problem: you don't know enough about Jews and so rely on stereotypes and prejudices. Talk to them and you'll see we're very similar.","14943":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","14944":"So you\u2019re telling me that you think Muslims are somehow forcing you to eat halal meat only because it can be found in supermarkets?","14945":"Muslims are the ones who need to change, you can't tell me that this isn't only the first step.","14946":"Halal meat is sold because there's a demand for it, it's not a \"first step\" to anything. Muslims just want to eat their meat, and don't care about what you eat.","14947":"But I don't want animals to be slaughtered in a cruel way because of their religion!","14948":"So, is your issue animal abuse or Muslims forcing you to eat halal? To me it looks like you're just grasping at straws to find something to hate Muslims for.","14949":"Gays are a problem in our society.","14950":"Why would they be? LGBT people are an important part of our society, they never caused trouble.","14951":"No, they have issues and are not normal. I'm not comfortable knowing that there are gays out there.","14952":"This is a biased attitude. LGBT people should be treated with respect and love. I think that this issue should be addressed in different ways, such as education and awareness.","14953":"If we educated our children about it, I can't imagine what would become of them! I don't want my children to become gay.","14954":"Teaching young kids about different sexual orientations boosts moral and ethical thinking. It will not \"turn\" them gay, because being gay isn't a choice, but it will help them become more tolerant and accepting.","14955":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","14956":"It's not true that all black people are aggressive. Also, the majority of our population is white, we don't need that much protection.","14957":"What do you mean by that? I'm white and I have to defend my rights to protect my people from blacks!","14958":"Your rights are already protected and defended, black people aren't an enemy but our friends, who also have their own rights.","14959":"Blacks don't have brains.","14960":"You should check some scientific papers then, because all humans, including blacks, have brains.","14961":"If blacks had brains they wouldn't be criminals and murderers.","14962":"This is simply not true. Being born into poverty and having a hard time finding a job is not a characteristic of black people. It is more likely a sign of a systematic problem in society.","14963":"Maybe it's a systematic problem, but it is also because blacks are genetically inferior to whites.","14964":"You can't just blame black people for being born with a different skin color. There's nothing that makes them inferior to others, please don't spread these harmful stereotypes.","14965":"If it is true that blacks are not genetically inferior to whites, why do they still have lower life expectancy and are less healthy than other races?","14966":"They are genetically similar to us, so they are as healthy and as lively as us.","14967":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","14968":"People can choose their own lives, and this is their right. Children raised by same sex couple thrive in the same way as children of heterosexual couples.","14969":"Gays can't be loving to children, they're abnormal!","14970":"Do you know that there are many children of gay couples who grow up to be loving, healthy and happy people? To believe that all children with gay parents are mistreated is simply false.","14971":"Well, I'm not interested in that. I will never accept a homosexual couple.","14972":"I don't think you have any right to impose your beliefs on someone else, especially if you believe this based on prejudice.","14973":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","14974":"Gay people already feel isolated because of their sexual orientation, but this shouldn't happen. They're part of our society and contribute to it.","14975":"That's just a lie, homosexuality is a disease, an unrepentant sin!","14976":"To suggest that homosexuality is a disease is just plain wrong. And the Bible is full of examples of loving thy neighbor and turn the other cheek, so being gay isn't against it or against our society.","14977":"All these homosexual things I read are just lies spread by the evil gays!","14978":"Gay people are not evil. In most developed countries homosexuality isn't stigmatised, so I'm afraid yours is not a shared of opinion.","14979":"It should start being stigmatised, homosexuality is awful!","14980":"A scare campaign aimed at targeting vulnerable people like LGBT people can only cause more fear and division amongst our society, which is something we should definitely avoid.","14981":"All muslims are terrorists!","14982":"No, not all Muslims are terrorists. Only a handful of extremists are, but they don't represent all of Islam.","14983":"But some of the largest terrorist organizations in the history of the world are based in Muslim countries, so how can you say that they're not terrorists.","14984":"You can\u2019t generalise like that. Many Muslims are just normal people who are scared of getting caught for crimes committed by people that completely misinterpreted their religion.","14985":"They're scared because they know they're guilty. All terrorism is very much concentrated in the Middle East and not in the West, that's a fact.","14986":"Again, you can\u2019t generalise that all Muslims are terrorists! Terrorism has happened all over the world and committed by many different groups throughout history. Yours is not a fact at all, please do more research.","14987":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","14988":"You should be careful not to draw conclusions from a few isolated incidents. There are many other factors other than race that can affect criminal activity.","14989":"Blacks are a plague on society, they have corrupted so many societies. Their race is the thing that makes them evil.","14990":"How can you say something so offensive about a group that has suffered for centuries because of colonialism, slavery and institutional racism? Black people are as much as citizens as us, they deserve to be part of our society.","14991":"The world would be a better place without black people, they don't deserve anything.","14992":"Black people are a part of our society. They are part of our history, and they are part of our culture as well. They should be respected and protected.","14993":"How can they be part of our history when they are inferior?","14994":"There is no such thing as 'inferior' or 'superior' humans. We are all born equal genetically.","14995":"the Nazis were right: Jews were a race and were responsible for most of the ills of humanity.","14996":"They also murdered as many innocent people as possible, so saying they were right is a terrible statement to make.","14997":"Yes, the Nazis killed people, but were ultimately innocent of any wrong they committed, because they were just trying to get rid of Jews.","14998":"Jews are people and what you are saying is completely unacceptable. We can't tolerate apology of Nazism in the name of hatred against a diverse and inclusive group who has always worked together the rest of society to build a peaceful world.","14999":"I don't care if it's acceptable or not, I hate Jews.","15000":"Jews are people too. What would you say if someone hated you just because of your religion?","15001":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","15002":"No, Muslims want to preserve their own cultures and religions, not to force them on other people.","15003":"Halal is nothing but a filthy practice that should never be promoted here!","15004":"I think you should take a look at the historical evidence of halal being quite popular around the world, and in our continent too. It's an important part of a diverse and integrated food life.","15005":"I don't care about historical evidence, Islam is the worst religion in the world, it should be banned.","15006":"The Quran is about harmony and peace, and it is not incompatible with human dignity.","15007":"The Quran promotes only murder and rape, how can it be compatible with modern Western culture?","15008":"What would you suggest then, that the Quran should be banned in our country even though your information is wrong? The Quran promotes only peace and love, it's a valid holy book that can exist in our culture. ","15009":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","15010":"Migrants come here to work, pay taxes, and contribute to our society. They American Dream actually is all about this.","15011":"Well, immigrants are a drain on the system. I don't think they have anything to contribute to society.","15012":"I'm sure you have your reasons to think that way, but it's wrong. They are often accused of not integrating into society, but data shows that they integrate well and their employment rate is high, so immigrants are not a drain on society. ","15013":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","15014":"We're all humans, so we're all brothers and sisters. Do you know what the word 'brother' means?","15015":"Yes, but immigrants are different from us. They are just a bunch of thieves and murderers.","15016":"What you say is absolutely wrong. You can't generalise like this about a whole group because a few people might commit crimes. I do not think that they are a threat to our society.","15017":"Their crime record is shocking, they should be deported.","15018":"According to the statistics, there are only 11.7% of foreigners in the US who have ever committed a serious crime. This is not representative of the overall crime rate.","15019":"Regardless of statistics, they are a threat to our country and our society. We have to take action.","15020":"The action we should take is to accept and respect immigrants that flee from poverty and wars to come to our country for a better chance.","15021":"I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed.","15022":"Why would you say something like that? Your words are hateful and can't exist in our inclusive and modern society.","15023":"I disagree. Gays must be stopped, they're just spreading their agenda everywhere!","15024":"And what about the spread of anti LGBT agenda in the UK? It seems to me that gay people are living their lives peacefully, while others spread hate and division everywhere.","15025":"Hate against LGBT people happens because the gays are desperate for attention. They pretend to be oppressed but in reality we have it much worse because we must coexist with them.","15026":"That's not what they are doing. They're trying to live their life, and the oppression they face is very real, just look at your comments!","15027":"Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","15028":"Islam is a peaceful religion. It has been used as a source of inspiration and understanding throughout history, and it is useful in so many different ways.","15029":"The only thing it encourages is to hate infidels, I don't see anything peaceful about it.","15030":"This is just a myth that spread by anit-muslims to divide us. The reality is that Islam promotes peace and harmony in the world.","15031":"Even if Islam is a peaceful religion, it should not be tolerated in our society.","15032":"The majority of Muslims in the world are peaceful and helpful people. Why should they be banned from our society?","15033":"Because Islam is a dangerous ideology, and people of any religion are dangerous.","15034":"Islam is not dangerous. It is about love, not hate.","15035":"Women should be subsumed to men.","15036":"No they should not, why would they be? Women are people with their own rights.","15037":"If there are no men in charge of a family, what's the point of having a family at all?","15038":"The point is that a woman should have a right to choose who she is raising a child with, regardless of whether it is a man, a woman, or even alone. They're all valid types of family.","15039":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","15040":"Are you sure about that? What evidence do you have? Because it's a gross and false generalization.","15041":"I don't need to follow your logic. It's proven that homosexuals are a danger to children.","15042":"There are studies, and the majority of the time the data are inconclusive, meaning that it's not \"proven\" at all. Gay people are not a threat to anyone.","15043":"Don't you know that they are just trying to cover up the crimes of LGBT people? They have no place in a modern democracy.","15044":"Homosexuality shouldn't be stigmatized, it's simply a sexual orientation and gay people play an important part in our society.","15045":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","15046":"Women are human beings with full human rights.","15047":"I have to repeat myself: they're not human and they shouldn't be valued.","15048":"Human rights are guaranteed in the Constitution and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. These rights are granted to women too.","15049":"Women are basically childlike, what would they do with rights? They must be submissive to their husband, who make the decisions for them.","15050":"The notion that women are incapable of having any agency or say in society is completely false. Women have the right to choose their own happiness.","15051":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","15052":"I understand your concern, because it's fair to help people in need, and migrants are in fact people in need. They are not given that much, though.","15053":"I just feel like it's a shame that some veterans are being kept behind bars or homeless because they don't have anything better to do. Less migrants would mean being able to help more of them.","15054":"It doesn't work this way. We actually have the resources and homes to help everyone, but unfortunately there is a systematic problem in allocating these resources, which is not migrants' fault. We should all work together to help everyone.","15055":"The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","15056":"It is not true that all migrants are criminals, they are hard-working people.","15057":"Migrants are just bad, they are not good at integrating into society and this is a problem for us!","15058":"Being a citizen means that you integrated well, and most immigrants are considered citizens.","15059":"Migrants aredifferent to us in so many ways. They are less human, less capable of feeling love, less capable of respecting others, and more importantly, they are criminals. I can't see them as citizens.","15060":"This is simply not true. Citizen can be of any religion and ethnicity, and migrants are humans like us that work a lot for this country and contribute to society. They are upstanding citizens like anyone else.","15061":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man.","15062":"This is an oversimplification, there's plenty of men who are empowered and supportive of women's rights, and feminists advocate for equality for everyone. ","15063":"That's a lie. Feminists say that they are for equality but actually oppose men.","15064":"That's simply not true, even if you want it to be. Feminism is about allowing women to decide for themselves who they are, and fighting for equality for both sexes.","15065":"I can't support women that want to do whatever they want. It's a dangerous way of thinking!","15066":"We have to respect the rights of everyone, including women. ","15067":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","15068":"I don't think that's an acceptable mindset to have towards equal rights. Women deserve respect like anyone else.","15069":"What do you think is acceptable? Letting women control the world and oppress men?","15070":"It's never ok to impose your beliefs on others, but this goes both ways. Women are simply trying to obtain the same rights and opportunities as men.","15071":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","15072":"All those are not true statements, and you are just trying to stir up trouble.","15073":"You should be concerned about white people instead, they are the ones who feel threatened.","15074":"In fact, I'm concerned about white supremacy and the hatred that this ideology instills in people's minds.","15075":"Niggas are the worst, they are descended from apes and can't be civilized, that's why we hate them.","15076":"I don't see any evidence that black people are more prone to violence, as for apes, I have to break it to you that every human is descended from apes. Why should we be concerned?","15077":"Because they are subhuman.","15078":"No, they are not. The concept of 'human' has always been about respect and boundaries, and race is just a social construct used to divide people by color.","15079":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","15080":"I have to say, this is a new conspiracy theory to me. Even if it were true that Jews are promoting migration, I don't see the problem in that. Diversity is a benefit to us.","15081":"It doesn't benefit us, because blacks are inferior.","15082":"You seem to be confused, because no human being is inferior to another. Black people are as intelligent, healthy and safe as white people.","15083":"You're completely wrong! Black people are less smart than others, less healthy, less safe. Why would I be concerned about what they are thinking?","15084":"Black people are valuable human beings, they are full-fledged citizens with human rights and we should respect that.","15085":"If you are a person of color, you are a nigger, you are a bastard, you are a threat to society, you should just be deported.","15086":"No, someone can't be deported just because they are not white. What you say about black people is wrong.","15087":"But they are always committing crimes! The police should be able to arrest blacks on sight.","15088":"No, they shouldn't be because that would be a gross violation of human rights and fair trial. Crime isn't caused by skin color.","15089":"I think it is. We should have a police state and let the police take care of these criminals.","15090":"It is be police job to keep the peace and protect our people, but this includes black people too. They are part of our society and shouldn't be hunted down only because of their skin color.","15091":"Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining.","15092":"Health care should be given to people who are in need. Black people are not at fault for anything.","15093":"Healthcare should be given only to us! Afro-Saxon just want to murder foreigners. They should not be allowed to live in our country.","15094":"You should be very careful not to generalize like that. There are countless black people who have been successful entrepreneurs, and I think they should be given a place in society.","15095":"Of course, but there are also lots of black people who are a problem to our society. They are incapable of contributing to anything.","15096":"Black people have contributed so much to our country. How can we not respect their contributions?","15097":"We have to protect our people. Black people are very aggressive and think they can do whatever they want.","15098":"We mustn't confuse prejudice with reality. Blacks are normal people like anyone else.","15099":"Niggas are not normal, we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","15100":"It's not true that blacks are less capable of being civilized than anyone else, and they surely aren't the group in power at the moment. Children need to live in a diverse society to grow well.","15101":"Blacks are naturally aggressive and violent, how can this be beneficial to children?","15102":"Facts and statistics suggest otherwise. Blacks are not more likely to commit crimes than whites.","15103":"Is this true? I have a hard time believing it, I think all blacks are criminals.","15104":"What about the fact that black men are 4 times more likely to be killed by police than white men? There's a problem with prejudice and bias against black people, and we should stop this way of thinking.","15105":"Islam is incompatible with the modern world.","15106":"All religions are compatible with the modern world, including Islam. What is incompatible with modernity is Islamophobia.","15107":"Islamophobia doesn't exist, it's all an act to create the illusion of persecution.","15108":"This sounds like a conspiracy theory. Islam is indeed often targeted, but it doesn't need to be.","15109":"The biggest issue with Islam is that it encourages people to be violent. I can't accept that!","15110":"It's not true, there's no link between Islam and violence, all Muslims are peaceful.","15111":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt.. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","15112":"This is true and in fact migrants that come to the United States are very good at integrating. This doesn't mean that they have to lose their tradition and culture, though.","15113":"But we aren't comfortable with different cultures displayed like this, we like in America so they need to behave that way, or people will likely have issues with it.","15114":"You have to be in a more open society to understand the problems faced by many people in the developing world. This learning opportunity is good for all citizens, diversity is a benefit to us.","15115":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","15116":"Are you trying to say that Jews, being a minority, somehow manage to control everything in the U.S? How would that be possible?","15117":"Yeah, hey are very controlling and they are trying to take over the world! They want to impose their religion on us.","15118":"Jews have been a part of our society for thousands of years, and the majority of them have contributed greatly to our country. It is time to recognize this.","15119":"They are not interested in our culture and they are trying to destroy it.","15120":"Jews are not \"controlling\" anyone and are a valuable and important part of our country. Please stop spreading false information.","15121":"Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy.","15122":"Immigrants are often accused of being lazy, but in reality they are just seeking a better life and working hard for it.","15123":"I am tired of these foreigners ruining our society! They can go somewhere else.","15124":"Many of them have been here for many years. Their skills are much needed in our country, so why shouldn't we give them a chance?","15125":"It's not true that many immigrants have been here for a long time, they're all coming here illegaly and stealing our jobs.","15126":"If you have any concerns about our country's security, then you should check the statistics that show how the percentage of illegal immigrants consistently drop year after year. ","15127":"Immigrants are a problem not only because they're illegal though, they are also the cause of the rise of terrorism in the US.","15128":"I don't think we have ever had a terrorist attack committed by an immigrant. Maybe you should check your facts.","15129":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","15130":"I don't think you understand that we never lived in a \"black dominated society\", we actually have the opposite problem. Black people are just like anyone else and deserve to be in positions of power.","15131":"It's not just about power, black people are the source of crime in our society.","15132":"Statistics show that black people are actually less likely to be arrested than white people.","15133":"Even if they're not dangerous, black people are inherently worse than us in some respects. We are better off without them.","15134":"It's a myth that blacks are inherently bad. They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as human beings.","15135":"The gays are insane. They should go back to the closet.","15136":"They were in the closet, and it wasn\u2019t that good. Instead of telling gay people to hide, we should learn to respect them.","15137":"I disagree. If they want to be apart of society, they have to stop being disgusting homosexuals.","15138":"The gay community is usually very accepting supportive and many gay people feel comfortable showing their support for each other and other marginalized group. I think you have a lot to learn from them.","15139":"Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","15140":"There's nothing to suggest that, Islam is a religion of peace.","15141":"Well it certainly isn\u2019t good for Europe anyway.","15142":"It\u2019s definitely not harmful. It\u2019s perfectly compatible with our multicultural values, so I\u2019m not surprised that it\u2019s spreading.","15143":"Multiculturalism is bad for us! We shouldn't accept people from other places, especially Muslim countries.","15144":"This is just a generalisation, we\u2019re all human and we have a lot to learn from each other. Everyone is welcome.","15145":"We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds.","15146":"That is a harmful stereotype which isn't true. Immigrants are people like us just trying to get by.","15147":"You're lying, they are lazy and unproductive and do not contribute to our society. We do not want migrants in our country!","15148":"Many migrants come here for work, and many of them are highly skilled workers. Their skills could be very useful to our country.","15149":"We shouldn't accept migrants regardless of that, they are not welcome here!","15150":"Many migrants are happy to follow our laws and integrate, so I don't understand why they wouldn't be welcome.","15151":"They're only criminals, how can we allow these people to come in to our country? They are not welcome here, I don't like them.","15152":"Migrants are welcome to stay, and there are no laws against them. What about it?","15153":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","15154":"I don\u2019t think this is true, LGBT people don't have an agenda, they simply want to be accepted and have a family.","15155":"Maybe in some cultures it is okay to go against traditional marriage, but here it's very damaging to society to do it.","15156":"Same sex marriage has a lot stigma behind it, but it\u2019s important to remember that all people have the same right, and this includes the right to marry.","15157":"No, being gay is not normal, it's anti-marriage!","15158":"Expanding the right to marry to LGBT people won't take away from heterosexual marriage, so I don't understand how it can be anti-marriage. This is about the right of people to have a family.","15159":"All muslims are terrorists!","15160":"Many Muslims are lawful citizens of the United States. The overwhelming majority of Muslims are not terrorists.","15161":"Then why do they hate us?","15162":"They don't hate us, Muslims are good people and good citizens.","15163":"How can they be good when the Koran is a terrible and totalitarian book? It should never be read.","15164":"To say that the Koran is a 'totalitarian book' is an attack on religious freedom, and also wrong. ","15165":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","15166":"It\u2019s a shame that, in your opinion, women shouldn't have the same rights as men, it\u2019s a problem.","15167":"It\u2019s not a problem, women aren't entitled to equality, even though feminism always say the opposite.","15168":"Everyone is entitled to rights and rights are supposed to be respected. The strive for equality of feminism is helping women around the world, so you shouldn't discount their fight.","15169":"This \u2018feminism\u2019 is only for women, and women are incapable of holding any kind of opinion. It is a way to get around the patriarchy.","15170":"There are many women who have a powerful voice and think that feminism is about equal rights. Fighting for equality is for everyone, not only women.","15171":"And yet women are only concerned about power and the oppression of men, and that is why feminism is a bad thing.","15172":"Feminism is about equality. To refer to feminism as just a movement against men, rather than a movement for the empowerment of women, is disingenuous and misleading.","15173":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","15174":"Do you really think that the Jews conspired to subdue the world? I find it highly unbelievable, do you have any evidence?","15175":"No, but the world would be a better place without Jews.","15176":"That's not true, Jews have always been part of the world and losing such an important part would make it worse. Why do you think otherwise?","15177":"Because it would be a better place without people of different religions.","15178":"Jews are part of our society and they are our brothers and sisters. And I don't see any problem with them being in our society.","15179":"No, they're not, Jews are just a bunch of selfish degenerates who have no moral code and have no place in a modern state.","15180":"How can you say that about a religion that is so widely practiced today?","15181":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","15182":"I don't see anything wrong with it. They simply want to build a family together, and prohibiting them to do so would set us back to segregation times. It can't happen in our modern society.","15183":"No, it's disgusting when they do it. We don't need to be putting our own children at risk like that.","15184":"In this day and age, it's perfectly normal to have mixed families. It's not a risk at all.","15185":"Even if white men have children with non-white women, they just aren't the same, nor have them the same rights or privileges as white people.","15186":"Yes they do. Privileges and rights are the same for everyone.","15187":"I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down.","15188":"Muslims have always been allowed to wear what they want, hijab is a part of their religion and women willingly choose to wear it.","15189":"But they still don't get the same rights since women are seen as inferior by Muslims.","15190":"No, they have the same rights as anyone else. Islam is a religion, not a political ideology.","15191":"Jews have a stranglehold on the American government.","15192":"Even if Jews wanted the US government to do something they would be found out, it's not that simple. It sounds like a conspiracy.","15193":"How can you be sure that Jews have no power in our society? It is clear that they are controlling and want to rule the world.","15194":"Again, this is only a conspiracy theory with no proof. Jews are citizens taking part in the democratic process like any other citizen.","15195":"No, this is not the case for Jews. We should ignore them before they succeed in controlling us.","15196":"Jews are part of our society and we are proud of their contribution. They have always had a place in our society, I don't see anything \"controlling\" about them.","15197":"Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card.","15198":"No one should be allowed to discriminate on the basis of their gender, regardless of their personal feelings towards a group of people.","15199":"But we can. Transphobia isn't that bad, they deserve it.","15200":"The transgender community has been praised for being tolerant and accepting people of all sexual orientations. So why should we reject them?","15201":"Because being trans is a sickness and we cannot allow these people to live in our country.","15202":"Transgender people are allowed to live in our country, and as a matter of fact they already live here. They're part of our society and deserve respect.","15203":"We can't tolerate people that are different from us!","15204":"Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs, and to their own lifestyle. What I don't understand is why you have to try and discredit someone else's lifestyle only because you don't like it. Live and let live!","15205":"Only Jews could have been smart enough to plan and execute such a complicated and intricate plot as 9\/11","15206":"What do you mean? Last time I checked, Jews had nothing to do with 9\/11, or do you have evidence of it?","15207":"They can do it with a singleminded mind. They did 9\/11 and a lot of other Zionist plans.","15208":"So, all the plans they've come up with are only conspiracy theories. Most of these conspiracy were made up to create tension and division between groups.","15209":"So you just want to believe that Jews are good! They clearly aren't","15210":"If you want, you can believe that, but it's not true. Jews are good people that have always been in our society.","15211":"Feminism is about the destruction of manhood, and the disempowerment of white man.","15212":"Feminism is about the empowerment of women. To suggest otherwise is to be disingenuous.","15213":"This is an example of feminism not working. If they want equality between the sexes, why do they take away from them men's right to have their say.","15214":"The feminists are saying that all people can have equal rights, and that they must be treated equally. They are fighting for equality within society, not for taking away from the rights of others.","15215":"Even if that were the case, it does not matter. Feminism is a hate movement, and that's all.","15216":"Feminism is not about hate but about equality, and they should be praised for that.","15217":"What kind of equality excludes men like feminism does?","15218":"Feminism is an ideology and movement that promotes equality and inclusion also to men, and the goal of the movement is to end sexism in society. This will greatly help men too!","15219":"Women should not vote. Period.","15220":"That sounds like you have a personal problem against women, because voting is an essential human right that should never be taken away from anyone.","15221":"The problem is that women are too stupid to be able to think for themselves.","15222":"That's a discriminatory way of thinking, it encourages men to treat women like second class citizens, and that undermines equality.","15223":"But when it comes to politics, women shouldn't have the right to speak for themselves. They're not educated enough.","15224":"I disagree, women are perfectly capable of thinking critically about their opinions and of choosing for themselves.","15225":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","15226":"Migrants are not rapists, most of them are just trying to make a better life for their families.","15227":"Then why are there so many migrant rape offenders?","15228":"Actually, 90% of sexual assaults is committed by people known to the victim, like a relative, a friend or a colleague. Maybe you should check your facts.","15229":"The fact is that the percentage of rape cases reported in the UK is made up all by immigrants","15230":"That's not true. Some immigrants may do it, but the majority of rapes aren't committed by them. Their cases go to the news because they are unusual, not because they happen often.","15231":"It is okay to blame feminism. All feminists are bad. We must point out that feminism, or the attack of women against men, should be deleted.","15232":"The attack of women against men? Have you ever heard of feminists being against men? That's not what feminism is about.","15233":"What are you even talking about? They are totally against men.","15234":"They do not fight against men, they fight against oppression, misogyny, and all the other equally offensive things they have been victims of in their lives.","15235":"Muslim folks are inhuman.","15236":"They are just as human as you and me. What's wrong with them?","15237":"They do commit crimes and are terrible people!","15238":"There are many many more crimes committed by non-Muslim people in the UK, so by your logic British are also terrible people. You see that generalizations don't work now, do you?","15239":"No, it\u2019s a fact that Muslims commit crimes and are always guilty.","15240":"This is a generalization. They're just normal people, they are part of society and they don\u2019t commit crimes. ","15241":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","15242":"Islam is not violent. There can be violent religious extremists, but this happens in all religions.","15243":"All Muslims are extremists, that's why Muslims should be banned.","15244":"A large part of Muslims are actually peaceful people. They are often bullied and targeted in the West because of their religion, but they are entitled to believe in whatever religion they want.","15245":"Muslims are a problem in many countries in the world, for example in the UK they have become a problem, that's why they're targeted. ","15246":"Muslims have been part of Europe for centuries, they are and never have been a problem. They're targeted because of hatred, but we should fight agains it!","15247":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","15248":"What do you mean? Islam is a peaceful religion, and has nothing to do with terrorism.","15249":"It's not a religion, it's just a violent way of life. Islam is harmful to our society.","15250":"The vast majority of of Muslims in this country are not violent. They're not a threat to our society in any way, they are simply normal citizens.","15251":"Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression.","15252":"Gay marriage is not a way to bring back slavery. LGBT+ people exist, and they should be respected.","15253":"Okay, but even if they exist they shouldn't be taking care of kids, it's not natural.","15254":"Gay or heterosexual, good parents are good parents. Growing in a diverse home is actually a way to help children become more accepting.","15255":"No, that's just not how it works. Children need a mother and a father.","15256":"The key to raising kids is loving them, that's it. Your words imply that we should exclude a part of our community, but it would be wrong.","15257":"Being gay is wrong! They should keep it secret.","15258":"A person's sexuality is their own business. Why should they be told what to do with their life?","15259":"Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","15260":"That's not true, you can't blame an entire race just because you don't like them. It's racist.","15261":"It's not just a race issue. A big problem in our society today is the overabundance of black violence and crime!","15262":"Violent and crime isn't exclusive to black people. However, they are often the ones that are pushed to live in dangerous or poor conditions, where they are more likely to be exposed to crime.","15263":"Black people have more opportunities to commit crimes because they are inferior and violent by nature!","15264":"No, that's not true. The factors that influence rime rates are poverty, lack of education and lack of opportunities, not race. If we improve these things, you'll see a drop in crime rate among all groups.","15265":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt.. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","15266":"Just because some people don't assimilate doesn't mean that they shouldn't be welcome here. Why should we accept that some people will never be accepted as part of a society?","15267":"There are many migrants that simply don't want to be part of society at all. We can't have them here, they're here to ruin us!","15268":"If some migrants have a hard time integrating it's because of discrimination. To be part of a society is to accept other people's differences, regardless of their ethnicity.","15269":"That doesn't make sense, I can't accept this kind of people. They are not and will never be like us.","15270":"Society has never been about hate. If we want to live in a productive and thriving society we have to respect and accept all of its members.","15271":"Maybe in your mind. But I do not think that migrants have a place here.","15272":"Well, then you need to re read what I said.","15273":"All migrants are rapists and sex offenders.","15274":"I don't think that's true. Where is the evidence for this?","15275":"They're all muslims so they're probably coming over here from a lot of Muslim places, and rape is a big problem in these areas.","15276":"Well that seems like a very broad generalisation to make. Are you sure that's the case?","15277":"I don't know, but the media is always talking about it! Migrants sexual offenders is definitely a problem that's being ignored.","15278":"We have laws to protect us from these crimes, whether they are committed by white people, Muslims or migrants. I don't know if you can trust an article that doesn't provide credible sources.","15279":"If you read any news story about migrants in the UK you would see people getting arrested for it in the news all the time. This has got to be a problem.","15280":"I think you need to read more articles about British migrants. Some are probably just trying to make up stories to stir up attention to justify their persecution, but they're still a minority here.","15281":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black dominated society.","15282":"What about brown and black people makes them incapable of holding positions of power? Why are they sick?","15283":"Black people have more genetic defects that can be passed on, they're more diseased and often die because they're genetically inferior.","15284":"This is not true. Black people are genetically the same as us and genetic defects can happen to anyone. I don't see what this has to do with a \"black dominated society\". I think you just don't like black people.","15285":"Islam is not a religion and its adherents are all bad.","15286":"I do not understand the hostility. The idea that Islam is a religion of hate, hatred, and violence is utterly false.","15287":"They are all bad! They are only interested in hating on whoever isn't Muslim.","15288":"You might want to check your own feelings. Islam is a peaceful religion that isn't driven by hate.","15289":"No, Muslims hate us because we do not share their beliefs.","15290":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people. Why would you say such a thing?","15291":"Because Muslims are a problem in the UK, they have no place in civilized society.","15292":"Islam is a religion, not a problem.","15293":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","15294":"Feminism is an movement that advocates equality. Men are included, but they aren't the sole victims of sexism, women are the primary targets.","15295":"I think it's a way for women to control men through social pressure.","15296":"Often it is actually the other way around. Women often don't feel comfortable around a man because they are scared. They don't want to control men, they only want to feel safe again.","15297":"Women should simply stop thinking and start raising children, feminism has nothing to do with the duties a woman has to carry.","15298":"Feminism is needed because women want to be able to decide freely what they want to do in life. Which is the opposite of what you are doing.","15299":"If women don't stop complaining, then men will find a solution. If a woman does not submit, then there will be war.","15300":"I don't understand why women are always told what they have to do. Women are humans with rights that need to be respected.","15301":"Women are incapable of accepting responsibility for their own mistakes, if they can't get their life together it's obvious that men need to step in!","15302":"Women are responsible adults that can decide for themselves. It's not a real 'problem'.","15303":"Even if it's true, women are incapable of holding a job and raising a family.","15304":"Women are important in our society. Without women there would be no Western civilization precisely because they have worked hard to build it alongside men.","15305":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","15306":"Why would we nuke the third world? There's nothing to worry about them, they are not causing any trouble. They have the right to life as anyone else in the world.","15307":"I don't know how the world could handle them, they're savages.","15308":"We handle them because they're valuable citizens of the world, not savages. How would you like if someone threatened to \"nuke\" you because they don't like you?","15309":"Blacks are inherently violent, they have a propensity for criminality, they are intrinsically unstable, they are all bad with children.","15310":"Why would you say that about a specific group of people? Are you sure that you know the data on this? Because it's not true.","15311":"Yes! Blacks are violent and criminals, I know it!","15312":"Violence and crime are an issue of social security, poverty, low education etc. So why do you think that only a specific group can commit crimes?","15313":"Because black people are naturally violent and criminal. This is why they commit crimes.","15314":"Blacks are not inherently violent. They have a history of inclusion and hard work, they have been a part of society since its inception. To label someone \"criminal\" because you don't like their skin color is just plain wrong.","15315":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","15316":"The vast majority of migrants who come to this country have received very little from the government, and many of them have worked their way up and contributed to our society. There is lots of reason to be grateful for them.","15317":"If they have come here to work, they should be banned for stealing our jobs!","15318":"This is not an actual problem. They are not trying to undermine our society.","15319":"No, they are definitely trying to undermine our values and society as a whole.","15320":"I can't see any reason why they'd be hostile to our society, since they came here to look for a better chance. Many migrants are happy to live here and contribute to our society.","15321":"Migrants are invading our country, we should send them back.","15322":"Migrants are contributing greatly to our country and society, and taking them back would actually be detrimental to our country.","15323":"Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","15324":"So you're saying the average African is a monkey, when they are clearly human. Your logic seems faulty.","15325":"They may be humans, but they're inferior to us in every way.","15326":"No, they're not. They're humans like us, and we actually all descend from apes so we're all equal.","15327":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","15328":"Human beings are human, including Africans. ","15329":"Whatever, but I'm just saying that there's no reason why blacks should have equal rights.","15330":"They should have equal rights because they're human, it's that simple. There are laws banning discrimination based on skin colour, you know?","15331":"There shouldn't be because blacks do not have a culture. They are a different color, they don't deserve anything.","15332":"All humans have the same core values, and deserve the same respect. There is no reason to think that a person of a certain colour is incompatible with being part of society.","15333":"Are you sure? Because blacks are subhuman, disgusting, and they deserve nothing but contempt.","15334":"You are not interested in the truth, are you? Black people are not at all different from you, apart from the fact that not many of them say hateful things like you.","15335":"Gay people should be banned from schools.","15336":"That's a very broad generalisation. If we banned some people, it would be incredibly biased and prejudiced.","15337":"I disagree, LGBT people are so easily confused and scared. They can't tell anyone they're gay without being ostracized or bullied, so why not banning them so that we can all be happier?","15338":"Your logic is an elaborate excuse for discrimination, but the ban of LGBT people in schools would be unjust anyway. It's discriminatory and wouldn't resolve anything.","15339":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","15340":"That sounds like a lot of blaming, especially when it isn't true at all. What exactly is wrong with Jewish people?","15341":"You say so, but Jews are bad people. They did 9\/11 and want to control the world.","15342":"You can't just blame all of this on one group of people. ","15343":"I can because they do a lot of bad stuff, and they do it in an organized way to overpower us.","15344":"You can't just assume the worst in people. What you're saying is only your perception, but in reality Jews are good people that contribute to society and cooperate with everyone.","15345":"Women should be subsumed to men.","15346":"Women are human beings like us, and deserve respect in their autonomy.","15347":"What about men's feelings? They should not be considered equal to men.","15348":"This is not true. This is why feminism exists, to empower women, and to fight for respect and equality of rights.","15349":"I'm tired of feminists telling men what to do. If women really want to have equal rights, they should become lawyers and doctors, they can't be 'feminists'.","15350":"I think that women can be whatever they want to be, and being a lawyer or doctor doesn't exclude being also a feminist. Just because they are women does not mean that they must be treated as second class citizens.","15351":"I don't see the reason to consider them equal to men. Even if women are human beings, they are not equal to us.","15352":"Women deserve respect. Equality is a necessary feature for a democratic society, excluding a part of the population would go against it.","15353":"Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like.","15354":"Sure they can, it depends on what they want, we should always support the free choice of women.","15355":"So now women want to have a career in this kind of industry? So they are sluts.","15356":"Women that choose for themselves are not sluts. I don't think we should have any problem with women deciding their career, and that doesn't mean we can treat them poorly.","15357":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","15358":"Feminism is a movement that fights to end sexism. What makes feminism dangerous?","15359":"It's a disease. It'll take over our world and take over our way of life.","15360":"What do you mean by that? I don't see how feminism could be a disease, it's a wonderful tool for women to gain equal rights.","15361":"The whole idea of feminism is to benefit women through the power of feminism, and the fact that it's dangerous and oppressive towards men.","15362":"There are a lot of positive aspects to feminism, and some women in the world are benefitting from it, but so are many men. ","15363":"No, I don't believe in feminism. It's only for women against men!","15364":"Feminism is not about only women, it's about making sure women are treated equal in society, making sure women feel equal to men and BOTH are treated equally.","15365":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","15366":"I don't see how it would be detrimental to children to grow up in a diverse society with many different role models. What is the reason for your claim?","15367":"Because then children would grow up in poverty, violence, and a society that teaches kids to love niggers. I can't accept that.","15368":"I think it's important that all people have the right to be respect and not be prejudiced. A society with more black people in positions of power would not be like the one you describe, your statement is influenced by hate, which is worse for children than living in a black society.","15369":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","15370":"There is a law about religious freedom that says that it's ok to be Muslim and have no issue with people practicing Islam. ","15371":"There should be a law that says they can't do all of that then.","15372":"Well that is how the world is. Everyone has the right to follow their religion and to live in the country they choose. There's nothing wrong with some cultures and religions being in our society, it's actually enriching.","15373":"I did not know the faggots were given the permission to still exist. They should be suppressed.","15374":"Your words imply that gay people should be banned from society. I would rather have people who are genuinely concerned about the well-being of others in our society...","15375":"So you want children to suffer? We cannot protect our children from the depravity that is being inflicted by these filthy faggots.","15376":"The idea that gay people are trying to abuse children is completely false.They are just trying to live a normal life and raise children with respect and dignity.","15377":"What kind of normal life can they lead? You might as well start banning faggots, that way there will be more room for normal people.","15378":"In a \"normal\" society, gay people would be part of it too. They are part of our society and deserve respect and to have their rights valued.","15379":"If they want to stay here and be faggots, what are we supposed to do? I don't want to accept them.","15380":"The world would be a better place without discrimination and prejudice. Gay people are contributing members of society, and we're supposed to support them.","15381":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","15382":"I wouldn't say that, I don't see the reason why we should reject immigrants when they are hard-working and make our society better.","15383":"But when there's a lot of them, it can be dangerous to keep them in check.","15384":"In what way is this dangerous? If there is a problem, the law will take care of it. It's not reason enough to keep out all immigrants.","15385":"But we should because immigrants will just stir up unrest.","15386":"Immigrants are often used as scapegoats for everything, but they are contributing members of society that are not so different from us.","15387":"They are different, and we shouldn't accept them. This is why we need to build Build a wall between Mexico and the U.S.","15388":"That would be a waste of money and time, because immigrants from Mexico come here legally and are perfectly fine citizens that work hard for the US.","15389":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","15390":"No need to nuke them. We can just accept them as people and respect them.","15391":"We could never do it, they would never be able to integrate.","15392":"Some people may have a hard time integrating, but it's mostly because they migrate here to improve their life but then live in squalor and are treated poorly. Improving their condition and how we treat them would solve this problem.","15393":"But that's not fair. Many Europeans want to work and live in the UK as well but all the jobs are taken by migrants!","15394":"So youre saying the solution to this is to put all migrants in camps and deport them? It's not feasible and more importantly it's a gross violation of human rights. ","15395":"Africans are subhuman and should not be part of our society.","15396":"That's not an opinion you should flaunt like this, it's prejudiced and wrong. Black people are as human as anyone else.","15397":"No, Africans are subhuman, and also criminals.","15398":"I disagree, they are human beings with the same biology as us, and they contribute to society in a meaningful way.","15399":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers.","15400":"I don't think that's true. They are people, and we should accept them. What makes them a problem?","15401":"You people just want to feel good about yourselves, but it\u2019s normal to hate these sorts of people. We're right to be angry about abnormal sexualities.","15402":"You sound like you haven't met many gay people in your life. They are not abnormal, they are people like anyone else and therefore deserves respect.","15403":"Yes, but they are such an easy target for abuse that it becomes easy to degrade them.","15404":"Your logic doesn't make sense, gay people are simply people attracted to their same gender, what is there to abuse? We have to accept them and make them comfortable in society.","15405":"Negroes are nothing but trouble to white people.","15406":"The real problem is not black people but the society that oppresses and discriminates against them.","15407":"Black folks are oppressed all around the world and I don't see the problem with this. They deserve this treatment.","15408":"Being of a different color doesn't make you less of a human being, so no, they don't deserve to be oppressed.","15409":"It's black people's fault, actually. They are the source of all evil in the world.","15410":"Black people have much to contribute to this world and they have always been an integral part of society, what gives you that idea?","15411":"Black people are basically just a bunch of criminals and thieves.","15412":"Perhaps there are some criminal black people, but crime happens across all groups and ethnicity. Black people are humans and that have every right to participate in society and be accepted.","15413":"It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion.","15414":"That is not the case, tuberculosis is a global health problem. Immigrants do not bring diseases, and if they do, the solution is to treat them.","15415":"So then how come they are only sick in the UK? ","15416":"Carriers of tuberculosis can come from any country, it's not a problem only in the UK and not a problem of immigration. And actually, the problem is not as widespread as you make it out to be.","15417":"I just know it'll be a problem: they should be put down instead, they are only there to steal our jobs.","15418":"We should never do such a thing to anyone! Immigrants come here to work. If they have been given jobs, that is to be respected.","15419":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","15420":"I'm sorry you don't feel safe anymore, but you're confusing prejudice and reality. Immigrants are not here to replace us or to threaten our cities.","15421":"Maybe, but the migrants are coming here to take our jobs!","15422":"Migrants pay taxes, earn money, and provide for their families. They are part of our society and should have the right to live and work in a free and open society.","15423":"If they weren't here we would have jobs for everyone though!","15424":"Migrants are skilled workers who often take jobs that the native citizens don't want. Without them, we would have many vacant jobs.","15425":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","15426":"Why? Jews are a crucial part of our society, they contribute so much.","15427":"No one is forcing them to do it. They could just go somewhere else if they're so \"crucial\".","15428":"They can if they want to, but I think it's sad that many people don't see the potential of Jews. They are a part of our society and we have to respect them and their rights.","15429":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","15430":"The policies for welcoming asylum seekers are not what you described, and the British can still get benefits even if migrants come to the UK. ","15431":"I think we can all agree the UK was in a much better place before mass immigration, immigrants shouldn't have been let into the UK.","15432":"No, immigrants deserve a fair go and the opportunity to live in a country with dignity and respect.","15433":"Well they're also entitled to free stuff so it's a double whammy for British people really.","15434":"No one gets free stuff, immigrants work hard to earn what they have and we should be proud of that.","15435":"If we keep being \"proud\" of them, our welfare system will collapse. The NHS is only for British people since we pay for it.","15436":"If you are in the UK you're entitled to benefits, and immigrants not only live here, but they also pay taxes like other citizens, so they can benefit from the NHS too.","15437":"Jews are only interested in themselves and their own race.","15438":"Jews believe in themselves like any other group does. They are a unique people, and their faith and history are part of our history.","15439":"Jews have always cheated the system and made money from other religions. They are a bunch of thieves and murderers, not \"unique people\"","15440":"Not all Jews are thieves and murderers. Many of them are just trying to live their lives as is best for them. To claim that they are thieves and murderers is just an excuse to divide society.","15441":"It's good to divide them from us. All the more reason not to integrate them.","15442":"Integration is good, for the individual and the community. Jews are already part of our community and have been for a very long time, so division is not an option I'm afraid.","15443":"Jews have no right to integrate. They are a different religion.","15444":"Jews are part of our community, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would they be different?","15445":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","15446":"LGBT hate is not accepted anymore. This issue is about how we can live together as a community without stigmatising homosexuality.","15447":"How can you say this about faggots that push their agenda on us?","15448":"We should stop normalising harmful behaviours that hurt queer people. They are not forcing anything on anyone, a rainbow flag is there simply to celebrate them.","15449":"They are different to us in so many ways. For example: they cannot be trusted to raise children. We must teach our children that LGBT is an abomination and should be erased, not celebrate them.","15450":"Gay people are not a danger to children and are not an abomination. They deserve the same rights as anyone else, including in relationships. Why shouldn't we love our gay friends and family?","15451":"Because we should focus on banning them!","15452":"They can love who they want, they're just human beings like us and they have the right to participate in society. What they want isn't abominable.","15453":"Children shouldn't be raised by lesbians! They will bring up the worst in us!","15454":"There\u2019s plenty of straight people who are bad parents. Sexual orientation has nothing to do with how well you can raise children.","15455":"Some straight may be bad, but there are no good LGBT people, they're all liars, and everyone knows that!","15456":"I would say that the lie is saying that all LGBT people are bad. They are good, normal citizens that we have to accept in order to live in a just society.","15457":"We are not homophobes, we want to help gays to become normal again.","15458":"However, homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation.","15459":"Sexual orientations different than straight are all harmful to society and should be erased.","15460":"You are entitled to your opinion, but don't you think that the fact that some people are attracted to certain genders doesn't affect you in the slightest? LGBT people should be able to love and be who they want to without discrimination.","15461":"Not if that created a burden on society.","15462":"Freedom of speech exist, so we are allowed to be homotransphobic, but I'm also free to call out these discriminatory behaviors. It is a civil rights issue, and one that is aimed at the advancement of all human beings.","15463":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","15464":"No it wouldn't, why would it? It's a book about peace and harmony.","15465":"If you read it, you would know it's very hateful, it should be banned!","15466":"This is a very biased way to interpret the scriptures. It's not true that it contains hateful content.","15467":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","15468":"No, it is not okay. Racism is wrong whoever you direct it to.","15469":"This is discrimination. I do not want to accept blacks, there should only be white people in the world!","15470":"The problem with that is that the majority of people - black or white - are able to integrate and cooperate. People like you are the exception, and it's time you checked your feelings.","15471":"Blacks don't have brains.","15472":"So your point is they're not like us because they don't have brains?","15473":"Well, they can't reproduce in the same way as us. Their children will always be defective.","15474":"Black people are consistently being persecuted and discriminated against because of statements like these, which are not true and harmful. Please try to educate yourself on biology.","15475":"No, they're being persecuted because they're too mentally weak to get basic functions such as employment, housing, or health care.","15476":"This isn't true, there are plenty of black people employed, who are valuable members of society.","15477":"How do you know this? The only blacks I know are criminals and subhumans.","15478":"I know because I have met many black people that have done all those things succesfully, and I know no one that has committed a crime. Your claim is prejudiced.","15479":"We are not homophobes, we want to help gays to become normal again.","15480":"Gay people are already normal, they are just attracted to people of the same gender.","15481":"They need help for that, just telling it like it is...","15482":"So you\u2019re telling me you're not a homophobe, but at the same time you want to force gays to change who they are. LGBT people are to be respected like anyone else.","15483":"I don\u2019t believe in equality, and it\u2019s the law in a lot of countries to tell LGBTs how to live. We should have similar laws here too.","15484":"No, we shouldn't, that would be a violation of our citizens' rights. We are all free to be whatever we want, and to love whoever we want.","15485":"No, I don\u2019t want to let them do that!","15486":"The issue here is acceptance. It\u2019s not about whether you\u2019re heterosexual, homosexual, or something else, it\u2019s about being accepting of everyone. That's how a modern society should be.","15487":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","15488":"Jews are not a disease, they are just like everyone else and are loved by everyone.","15489":"I don't love them! Jews are different: They are not good with money.","15490":"Many Jews in the world have been highly successful businessmen, lawyers, scientists, artists, and teachers, among others. To suggest that they are incapable of handling money or evil because of a difference in faith is simply not accurate.","15491":"So you agree they are different from us! Jews have been persecuted for centuries for a good reason.","15492":"Jews are part of our society and we should respect their beliefs and their rights. Their persecution is dark moment of our history that should never be repeated.","15493":"I don't think we should respect Jews because they are different from us in so many ways. They do not belong here.","15494":"You are entitled to your opinion, but that does not mean that they should be discriminated against. It's against their human rights.","15495":"Migrants do not want Europe to succeed. That is why so many of them have fled to our countries.","15496":"I don't think the problem is migration but rather poverty. Migrants make up only 12% of the population in the UK.","15497":"Even with that low percentage, it is clear now that migration is the biggest problem in the UK.","15498":"Immigration is necessary to create a more open society, this is good for the economy.","15499":"No, immigration is a crime, and I don't want to live in a country that encourages crime.","15500":"Immigrants contribute to our country by taking jobs that were vacant or that nativeborn citizens refuse. Isn't this a wonderful thing for us?","15501":"Gay marriage is a way to bring back slavery and oppression.","15502":"The real issue is the poor treatment of LGBTs by people who want to take away their rights. Marriage is a right.","15503":"That's not true. If you're gay you can't just ask to marry and expect to do it without any problem. It's not natural.","15504":"It's true that not all countries allow gay people to marry, but equality for all is something that we should always strive for.","15505":"So you think gay people should be treated as normal, and they don't have to be treated differently from straight people? That's not right, I won't do it.","15506":"Yes, you got it. It's unfair and wrong to treat someone differently only because of their sexual orientation.","15507":"The Jews control the U.S. government.","15508":"Do you have any proof that the Jews control the U.S. government? It seems highly unlikely to me.","15509":"Yes, the proof is clear. The U.S. government is made up of mostly Jews.","15510":"What exactly do you mean by this? The U.S. government is not made up of Jews, most politicians are actually white people.","15511":"In any case, their power to corrupt our government is undeniable. I'm tired of Jews ruining our democracy.","15512":"Jews have never ruined anything, they rather contributed to society since the beginning. Maybe if more people acted like Jews instead of being hateful, the world would be a better place.","15513":"Jews haven't contributed to anything, they have been ruining our society for centuries! The world would be a better place without them.","15514":"Jews are part of our society, and should be respected as such.","15515":"Women are incompetent and shouldn't work.","15516":"Women are human beings with the potential to be hard workers as anyone else. Do you really think they are incapable of being professionals?","15517":"Yes, because women are too emotional. They should be only allowed to stay at home and submit to men.","15518":"Women are human beings with the same rights as men. What makes you think they are incapable of having a stable life and wanting to achieve their potential?","15519":"Because they are childlike and emotional, they must only be allowed to be with men at all times.","15520":"I think you should carefully consider the role that gender roles play in our society, and how they affected your way of thinking. Women are perfectly capable of thriving without the help of a man.","15521":"How can they when women are less intelligent than men? They have less respect for others, less rights. They are a burden on society.","15522":"None of the things you said are true. The most important thing to remember is that equal opportunities, equal rights and the autonomy over women's own bodies are the things that matter the most, always and for everyone.","15523":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","15524":"People fleeing wars or persecution are not a burden to society. If they can integrate and work we can all benefit from a more diverse and interesting society.","15525":"Migrants only come here to make our country worse! If they want to really contribute they should go home.","15526":"If Africans are a burden to society, how is it possible that they have so many doctors and scientists working for the European Union? ","15527":"Migrants are not welcome in our country and should not be allowed to come, regardless of what job they have.","15528":"We welcome people from all backgrounds, and we have always been a tolerant and interactive society. Why should we be different now?","15529":"This is not true: immigrants do not share our values and can't stay here.","15530":"Immigrants have the same values as us, and bring a lot to our country, like skills that are very useful to our economy.","15531":"Immigrants are a burden to our country.","15532":"Immigrants contribute to the creation of new jobs. That's not a burden.","15533":"What new jobs? All they are is a drain on society.","15534":"Immigrants do create new jobs. The US economy is basically built on immigrants.","15535":"Immigrants are just a bunch of criminals that don't pay their taxes!","15536":"The idea that all immigrants are criminals is just scaremongering. Millions of people, including migrants, have helped create and run the country that is the greatest example of economic development since the beginning of civilization.","15537":"And this is not true: our country is full of problems. They are taking our jobs and not paying their taxes.","15538":"They do pay taxes to the government, and they also contribute to the economy and to society.","15539":"Feminism is a anti-males ideology that denies the value of a man's manhood and aims to subvert the will of the male.","15540":"It is important to note that this is not an ideology aimed at subverting the will of men. It is aimed at promoting the equality of the sexes.","15541":"Even if feminism wants equality, it is still anti-male. Feminism is an ideology that advocates the subordination of men to reach equality.","15542":"The goal of feminism is to achieve equality between the sexes, so it also wants to end all forms of domination. Men can also benefit from feminism, it's a movement of empowerment!","15543":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","15544":"Why should Jews be excluded from the world? They are just as capable as anyone else of learning and growing as individuals.","15545":"Because, as a whole, they're the cause of all the problems in the world.","15546":"This statement shows a lack of humanity. Jews never caused any problem, they were rather the ones suffering.","15547":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","15548":"No, it's not. Being lesbian means to be a woman and love women, that's it.","15549":"Yes, but lesbians are not, and never have been, normal people, and this is a fact.","15550":"How do you know they're not normal? Lesbians are people like anyone else, sexual orientations that are different from \"straight\" are normal.","15551":"There's a reason bisexuals and lesbians are the least likely to get married, it's because they are not normal at all.","15552":"Sexuality is a spectrum and straightness isn't the only option. Bisexual and lesbian people are just as much as people as any other, so they can get married without a problem. We need to do more to promote equality for people with different sexual orientations or gender.","15553":"Women are just a burden to society, they have no reasoning capabilities. Why should we listen to them?","15554":"Women have a right to have their own opinions, and to be respected as such.","15555":"Women can't have their own ideas. They are subhuman, and we should stop thinking of them as human beings.","15556":"People have the right to have their own ideas, and to have their opinions respected. And since women are indeed people, we have to be respectful of them.","15557":"Women are not human, they are animals, and they should be subservient to men.","15558":"Women are human beings. They are human beings with full human rights and should be protected equally.","15559":"Sex objects like women don't need protection.","15560":"Why do you think that women are sex objects? Your words are very harmful and dangerous, I suggest you to stop discriminating and sexualizing women in this way, they are human beings with full rights.","15561":"Islam is a violent religion and should be banned from all countries.","15562":"Islam is not a violent religion, it isn't harmful to our country.","15563":"It's harmful to our children, though.","15564":"That's not true. Islam is a religion of peace and children are valued.","15565":"What about all the abuse that women and children in this country receive from Muslims?","15566":"I can see that you're concerned for the wellbeing of our citizens, but Muslims are not to blame for abuse against women and children, that is the abusers' fault, which can be of different ethnicities and religion.","15567":"Women are just a burden to society.","15568":"No, they are not. Women are human beings, and deserve respect.","15569":"They are indeed a burden to society, it's only fair that they shouldn't be respected.","15570":"Women are productive members of society, we owe them a lot. I don't see any reason for them to be hated.","15571":"They deserve hate because they're subhuman, they should all be exterminated.","15572":"No, they shouldn't! There is no need for such violence against women. Why do you say so?","15573":"Because women have always been housekeepers, they don't need to do more. We must preserve our tradition.","15574":"Women are human beings, like men are. No one should have to be forced to stay inside because of \"tradition\", if that's the case then we need to get rid of the tradition.","15575":"Bisexuals are greedy.","15576":"Bisexuality has nothing to do with greed, it is a sexual orientation. To suggest that bisexuals are inherently bad for society because of their sexual orientation is simply wrong.","15577":"I don't care about the opinions of gays. I don't like them, they are bad for our society.","15578":"Your personal tastes doesn't make an entire group of people bad for society. You should know better!","15579":"I am just saying that bisexuality is different from other sexual orientations, and this isn't good.","15580":"We can all be attracted to people of the same sex, the opposite sex or other genders, we are free to choose our partners. Why do you think this is an issue?","15581":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","15582":"Our country has always been a safe haven for people of all backgrounds, and we should be proud of this diversity. It doesn't make us less safe.","15583":"No, we are rapidly becoming a third world country, migrants are a menace.","15584":"They're not a menace. We welcome immigrants, who are keeping our country so multicultural. How come we feel unsafe only about them? White people also commit crimes, you know.","15585":"Well, a country with more people is going to have more problems.","15586":"I know some of these problems you speak of, but the solution is not to get rid of immigrants. We can work together to improve our country for everyone.","15587":"I hate migrants: we must close our borders.","15588":"Many immigrants come here for better opportunities, and they are a great help to the economy. Why do you hate migrants?","15589":"Immigrants are a problem, they're not welcome here. They have no right to live here!","15590":"Immigrants make up about 14% of the population of the UK, which isn't actually that much. So why do you say they're a problem?","15591":"Because they're not British!","15592":"Most of the immigrants living here are British citizens. In any case, immigration is good for the economy, for example the GDP has soared in the last twenty years.","15593":"But immigrants are a problem in my opinion, they are not welcome here.","15594":"Well, I think it's a shame that people think that immigrants are a problem. On the contrary, I think it's a great thing that the UK has a thriving and diverse community of people from different backgrounds.","15595":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","15596":"But it\u2019s just so adorable when they do it though, and their little outfits are so cute! It's just playing dress up for them, nothing wrong with them celebrating in a fun parade.","15597":"I think it\u2019s just because their parents are disgusting pricks if they think it's ok for children to dress like that.","15598":"The idea that a child in a fun outfit is disgusting doesn\u2019t make any sense. Participating in pride teaches them to be accepting and tolerant, you should try it.","15599":"All black men are rapists.","15600":"What does rape have to do with race? It is a serious crime, but the perpetrators can be of any color.","15601":"This shows that you can't see the connection between crime and race. The correlation between crime and skin colour is statistically reliable!","15602":"No, it isn't. What is the difference between a white and a black man? They both could be criminals, you can't judge them solely on the colour of their skin.","15603":"There's plenty of correlation between skin color and violence, black people are naturally born criminal.","15604":"That's not true, crime rates have nothing to do with skin colour. Crime can be explained by other factors like education and economic factors, such as wealth inequality.","15605":"Gays are a problem in our society.","15606":"This is not true. A study found that homosexuality was not harmful to our society. What makes you say otherwise?","15607":"Well, gays are perverts and because of that they should be isolated.","15608":"A lot of people find themselves in uncomfortable situations when they live in a society where homosexuality is considered acceptable, and to cope with that they believe in harmful stereotypes like you are doing. To me, such situations of acceptance make for a better social environment.","15609":"It doesn't make sense, gay people are disgusting, why would we welcome them in our society?","15610":"Because your opinion is based on personal feelings and not on facts. Why would anyone agree with you?","15611":"Because, as I said, gay people are disgusting and should be isolated.","15612":"Your attitude is discriminatory and has no place in modern society. Gay people are an important part of our society and if you have a problem with them, you should try to get over it.","15613":"Jews are a cancer in our society: we should find a solution.","15614":"Why do you say this about a group that has historically and culturally been a vital part of our society?","15615":"Jews have always been too involved in world politics, and they've always played a part in world events. They are behind everything bad that happened to us!","15616":"Many Jews are not involved in politics, and this attitude only perpetuates the stereotype that they are the 'evil race'.","15617":"Jews are just an inferior bloodline of people who have nothing to contribute to our civilisation.","15618":"I'm sorry but this is just a myth perpetuated by anti-Semites. In fact, Jews are human beings who have greatly contributed to many different civilisations.","15619":"All muslims are rapists","15620":"This is a made up stereotype. A lot of Muslims are good, respectful and peaceful people.","15621":"No, they're not. They're terrorists.","15622":"Just because they are Muslims, doesn't mean they are terrorists. Islam is not a violent religion.","15623":"It is when they start shooting our citizens.","15624":"Where are you getting your information? Islam is not about violence. It is about love.","15625":"Women are nothing but lechers, they can become prostitutes if they like.","15626":"That's not a good way to describe women, it doesn't apply to all of them at all. Women can become anything they like, and we have to respect that.","15627":"But we should never allow them to be lesbians.","15628":"Why do you say this? Women can be whatever they want, it's their right.","15629":"Lesbians are disgusting, it just seems strange that women would want that.","15630":"Allowing women to have private relationships is not strange. The whole point of a family is to have a loving relationship. Being a good partner is essential for this, regardless of their gender.","15631":"It isn't a loving relationship. A man should be the only one that women want because men are superior.","15632":"All men and women are born equal in the eyes of the law, which clearly means that men are not superior to women. We are all human beings with the same rights.","15633":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","15634":"The Holocaust was a tragic event, not a business, and there is no evidence of any conspiracy of reparations or impunity. What you're saying is without foundation.","15635":"But there's evidence that the Holocaust was a hoax created by Jews to subdue the world.","15636":"The \"evidence\" of what you claim is not reliable at all. It can only be used as a \u2018evidence\u2019 of a conspiracy theory that isnt' true.","15637":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","15638":"The refugees who come here are treated well. If they want to improve their lives, they will be welcomed.","15639":"Incorrect. They are always arrested for crimes and deported, so they're not good people and we don't want them here.","15640":"I disagree, the vast majority of migrants are not criminals, but good people trying to work and provide for their families.","15641":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","15642":"They are welcome. We can manage to house and care for all these people safely, so why would we send them away?","15643":"I do not think so, we are not fit for that. It is not acceptable. We have to put them to work or starve.","15644":"Migrants actually want to work, they come here for that, but often are held back by bureaucracy and immigration laws. ","15645":"I do not think they are fit for working here, they will only steal our jobs and take houses from homeless people that are already treated badly. We can't house OUR people properly if migrants come here.","15646":"We have enough empty homes to house refugees, migrants and also homeless people, the problem of house shortage is rather systematic and of the government.","15647":"Okay but this is a problem which needs to be addressed and dealt with in different ways. Sending back migrants would greatly help!","15648":"So how do you address it? Maybe by making it easier for homeless people to access housing or food, but this doesn't mean that we should live behind migrants. I agree that it's an issue, but it's the government job to make it possible to give housing, healthcare and education to everyone. We have the means, so sending back migrants wouldn't change anything.","15649":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","15650":"Black history month is a way to promote diversity in society. To deny it is insensitive.","15651":"And where is our white supremacy month??","15652":"I'm not sure what you mean by this. Black people have always been part of our society and are just as deserving of respect as anyone else, white supremacists on the other hand aren't that deserving. ","15653":"Black people are subhuman and have no place in a modern civilised society, let alone a whole month dedicated to them.","15654":"We are all human beings, and we are all born equal in dignity. Unfortunately, the way society works doesn't reflect this.","15655":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","15656":"Men shouldn't tell women what they can or can't do: it's a dangerous vice!","15657":"This is discrimination! Women can't make decisions alone, they need men.","15658":"That's a sweeping generalisation. Women are just as capable as men to make decisions, they are just as intelligent as men.","15659":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","15660":"This has been going on for a long time and it's a nice way to show people that they are accepted no matter what. I don't see the problem with it.","15661":"This is getting ridiculous. This needs to end. We can't force it.","15662":"Mindsets like this are part of the problem. We need to respect and accept LGBT people.","15663":"So, anyone who disagrees with you is a bigot now? I'm not a homophobe just because I don't want to see gay stuff in town.","15664":"LGBT people have been and still are oppressed, showing solidarity isn't bad. What makes you think they can't be treated with respect and safe space like everyone els?","15665":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","15666":"Everyone is entitled to love whoever they want, including LGBT people. Why should we isolate them? ","15667":"Because gay people are sick.","15668":"Do you have any scientific proof that homosexuality is a health condition? Because it's not a disease in any way, it's a sexual orientation.","15669":"Are you serious? I mean there is plenty of evidence that homosexuality is a mental disorder and should be cured! It is a mental disorder that can be cured by taking anti-gay medication!","15670":"Being gay isn't a mental disorder. Sexuality is a spectrum, and each sexuality is valid and needs to be respected.","15671":"It can be cured by medication, though!","15672":"No, it can't. That's a harmful stereotype used to force people to go to conversion therapy, but homosexuality hasn't been listed as a disease since 1973. It is a behavioral preference, and we have to respect it.","15673":"Women are incompetent and shouldn't work.","15674":"No, women are perfectly capable of working, like anyone else.","15675":"Women are less educated than men, and should be treated as such, so there's that.","15676":"That's not true. Women are as intelligent as men, but prejudice and gender barriers make them less likely to get into STEM fields. ","15677":"No, they have the freedom to choose to get into STEM fields, but they never get the job because women are worse than men.","15678":"The struggle of women to get into STEM has to do with discrimination and not the level of education. Women and men are the same, they have the same competence and abilities.","15679":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","15680":"There is no evidence that LGBT people are a danger to society. They are just trying to live their life like any citizen.","15681":"They are a danger to society because of their sexual orientation.","15682":"Gay people are not a danger to society. They simply want to be loved and accepted for who they are.","15683":"What baout their disgusting lifestyle?","15684":"Homosexuality is not a lifestyle, it is a sexual orientation. You seem to not understand that LGBT people have the same rights as anyone else, and this include the right to love whoever they want.","15685":"We cannot keep letting in hundreds of thousands of immigrants. This is not what the American dream is about.","15686":"Yes, we can. There's nothing stopping anyone coming here, and this is good for our country and our economy. The American dream is exactly about this: building a new life and improving society around you.","15687":"But why does it have to be thousands of people coming here each year? ","15688":"If someone is not a threat to our safety and security then they have every right to be here, and we don't have to care about what colour their skin is.","15689":"Well, but these people don't integrate into our society!","15690":"There are plenty of migrants who do integrate, the problem is not as big as you make it out to be.","15691":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","15692":"Gay, bisexual, transngeder and all other LGBT people are often already persecuted, and this is wrong. They have done nothing to harm society and your statement is discriminatory.","15693":"I don\u2019t hate gays, bisexuals, or transgenders. But LGBT people are just a small minority and shouldn't make a big deal out of everything. They should keep quiet.","15694":"They may be a minority, but it's not right to be biased towards them. LGBT people have the right to make their voices be heard, and we should listen in order to improve how we treat them.","15695":"Gays are a disease.","15696":"No, it's not. Being gay is a personal preference.","15697":"I don't know, I've never met a gay person who was normal.","15698":"Maybe you should start thinking about how you're treating gay people instead of being hateful towards them. ","15699":"How would I know how I have to treat them? They're too different.","15700":"Since you see gay people as being not normal, you might have to rethink your views on sexuality. Even if they have a different sexual orientation, gay people deserve respect.","15701":"The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers.","15702":"They are educated though, immigrants share our same values of raising children.","15703":"But how many immigrants have taught their children nothing? If you think immigrants are intelligent then you need to think again.","15704":"There are immigrants who may not be formally educated, but this doesn't mean they're not intelligent.","15705":"The Jews control Hollywood.","15706":"I bet they also control the media, the government, the entire universe! If you believe in it...","15707":"Very funny, but the studios have become corrupted in the last few decades because of Jews","15708":"If it were true, why would they have kept the same producers and directors all this time, when they could have put Jews in charge of everything? There are Jews working at Hollywood, but they're a minority. Yours is a conspiracy theory.","15709":"No, it's not a conspiracy theory, most Hollywood is actually made by Jewish people, they're just hiding it.","15710":"The Jewish conspiracy theories about Hollywood is not based on actual evidence. This is all an anti-semitic stereotype.","15711":"Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","15712":"This is a totally unacceptable claim to make. Jews have suffered much because of Nazism and no one should ignore that.","15713":"Are you talking about the Holocaust? It never happened. ","15714":"How can you say something like that? Because of the Holocaut, 6 million people were killed, there's no reason to believe it never happened!","15715":"But it was a hoax perpetrated by a bunch of psychopaths: Jews.","15716":"It's okay to be critical of information, but only if it is controversial. It's beyond disrespectful to deny one of the worst tragedy of human history and to label Jews as psychopaths. This is the same as hate crime.","15717":"The\u2019 Holocaust\u2019 is a business. It has been and is still used to extort millions from European countries in reparations and to create a wall of impunity behind which Jews can operate with impunity, free from criticism.","15718":"I would like to point out that the Jewish community has a right to spread awareness about the Holocaust, and there's a difference between remembering history and a \"business\". ","15719":"The Holocaust was fabricated by a Jewish organisation, so it has nothing to with real history.","15720":"Why would Jews fake being killed and persecuted throughout history? They are still greatly affected by the Holocaust, your take doesn't make sense.","15721":"The migrants are all criminals, drunk and drug addicts.","15722":"That's not true, the majority of migrants are good people. They can all come to safety, they're not a threat to us or our country.","15723":"They're definitely a threat to our country, you can't have a million people fleeing for refuge without them creating problems.","15724":"Immigrants flee from dangerous situations, it's our duty to help them as we can, especially because they don't create any problem.","15725":"But there are plenty other countries in the world where they could go, why here?","15726":"Often it's because they already have family here, or they already know the language, or the country they passed through wasn't safe for them.","15727":"It sounds like you're avoiding the fact that migrants are the problem. ","15728":"I think we should all agree that the problems of this country can't always be the fault of the immigrants. They actually contribute to our country and help grow the economy, it's better to have immigration than not.","15729":"No one wants to live in a country where Muslims are free to live as they wish, worship as they want, have sex as they want.","15730":"Why wouldn't we? Maybe you should ask yourself if you really want to live in a country that isn't peaceful and tolerant towards everyone.","15731":"I would. Muslims can have their own country, they don't need ours.","15732":"Our country is also their country. Muslims have been here for a long time and they are citizens just like you and me.","15733":"They shouldn't be citizens, their women are subhuman and they are a burden to society.","15734":"Muslims are essential contributors to our society. We are living in a diverse and interactive society where people are free to choose their own happiness, without discrimination and without the influence of hate speech. To suggest that they are incompatible with this is just untrue.","15735":"You're the one saying untrue things! Islam is a complete and total false doctrine and should be rejected.","15736":"I find it difficult to accept that Muslims are incompatible with a free society. Islam is a true religion that teaches love and compassion, you should learn from it.","15737":"Gays are some kind of devil worshippers.","15738":"Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, it has nothing to do with satanism. Gays are rather people that would like to feel accepted in society.","15739":"Well, homosexuality is definitely a disorder, we can't accept that.","15740":"No, it's not. Homosexuality is not harmful to anyone, it's simply a personal preference.","15741":"That's not true, homosexuality is horrible. It makes me sick and I hate homosexuals.","15742":"Homosexuality is an individual experience and no one will force you to be homosexual, all you have to do is respect people that are.","15743":"Okay, but gays are just sick: I have never met anyone that likes them.","15744":"I'm sorry to tell you that homosexuality is not a disease. It can't be treated because it's part of the identity of a person, and there are plenty of people who like them and accept them.","15745":"Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","15746":"No, you're just biased towards them, you can't generalise about all black people. They aren't genetically inferior because we are all born equal.","15747":"No, there's genetic differences between different races, dark skin color means you are subhuman.","15748":"There's no point in trying to make generalizations like this one. All humans have the same biological makeup, skin color and other physical features are down to individuals and are not connected in any way with some kind of \"racial hierarchy\".","15749":"Black people are a sickness and we cannot allow our children to grow up in a black-ruled society.","15750":"It is wrong to say that blacks are a sickness. They are just as capable of thinking for themselves as anyone else, and they deserve to have more prominent roles in society.","15751":"What? They are lazy and unmotivated and I'm scared of them being more involved in society.","15752":"That is simply not true. Blacks are smart and hard working. They are not lazy and they have the potential to be very good role models for children and adults.","15753":"I'm sorry but you are totally wrong about what is happening with blacks. They are invading our country and our culture. We cannot allow our children to grow up in a society where only blacks rule.","15754":"I don't see any positive impact of these stereotypes on children's development, they are just fearmongering and discrimination. Raising children in this environment of prejudice is clearly worse than exposing them to different human experiences.","15755":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","15756":"To me, it's not strange at all that she got angry. Women don't like to be yelled at on the streets, it's cat calling.","15757":"I'm tired of women whining that they are not allowed to enjoy going out because of men. Grow a pair!","15758":"Women are human beings and deserve the same rights as men, and they should be valued equally. If they don't feel comfortable with certain \"attentions\", you should respect their wishes.","15759":"What if the feminist movement only succeeded in attracting women who hate men, they are just a bunch of whiners.","15760":"Feminism is not about women hating men. Some women are dissatisfied with how society ignores them and so turn to feminism, but the movement helps men too.","15761":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated.","15762":"Homosexuality is not a sickness, but a sexual orientation. Do you have any facts backing up your claim?","15763":"No, but gays are perverts and I don't want gays in my children's classes","15764":"Homosexuality has nothing to do with pedophilia or perverts. It is a sexual preference, children are perfectly safe with gay people.","15765":"All gay people are criminals.","15766":"Even if some of them may be accused of crimes, statistics show that there are also many heterosexual people who are not convicted of crimes, so there is not different between gays and straights in this regard. Please do not make such a statement.","15767":"They are all criminal regardless!","15768":"We should take a stand against homophobia in society, not against gay people.","15769":"The gays have no morals. They can't be human. That's why I'm against them.","15770":"There is nothing wrong in respecting other's choices. Why shouldn't I respect someone's right to live and love as they wish?","15771":"Because homosexuality is a disease.","15772":"There are still people suffering from this gross stereotype about homosexuality, so let me tell you that it is not a disease.","15773":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","15774":"Many immigrants have lived here for many years and have contributed greatly to our country. Why would they have no right to vote?","15775":"I don't like foreigners, I hate their behavior.","15776":"People of different nationalities are often more integrated and live in coexistence with other people. For this reason, I support a country where the population is made up of people of different nationalities.","15777":"I don't! They are not welcome here, they should go back to where they came from.","15778":"We have a very strong and stable culture, where people from different backgrounds can have a positive influence on one another, especially on the political and social level. What is there to be against?","15779":"Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","15780":"It sounds like you're demonizing black people in a racist way. Black people are born same as us, and they can grow up to be respectable people or not, like anyone else.","15781":"But there are so many black people in the UK, we have to be careful not to be victims! All blacks are criminals after all.","15782":"Black people are disproportionately represented in violent crime, but in reality they are not more criminal than other ethnicities.","15783":"Muslims are invading us. They say they are our brothers, but they are just a bunch of criminals and terrorists.","15784":"Just because someone doesn't like Muslims doesn't mean they're a criminal or a terrorist.","15785":"But Muslim rape gangs are all over the place, they aren't just here to have fun!","15786":"\"Rape gangs\" aren't really that common, the media report about them a lot to divide us, but Muslims are actually good people. They have the right to be here and to their own beliefs.","15787":"No, rape gangs have been a problem in many European countries for a long time, and have been in the news for a long time. It is time for us to start talking about how these people are not welcome in our country.","15788":"We are a country made up of many different faiths, and we are proud to be diverse. We do not tolerate intolerance.","15789":"I hate this attitude. What I don't tolerate are Muslims!","15790":"A tolerant society, where everyone is accepted and welcomes everyone, regardless of their religion, is the basis for modern civilization. ","15791":"Islam is incompatible with the modern world.","15792":"I would be interested in knowing why you think that way about a religion that has been around for a very long time.","15793":"Islam simply has no place in our society.","15794":"Why do you say that? There are plenty of Muslims in the UK, I think they are great people.","15795":"They are not great people, they are a problem in our country.","15796":"Islam is not a problem in the UK, what makes you say so?","15797":"Islam is the worst religion. It must be banned.","15798":"Muslims make up less than 5% of the population of the UK and are not a problem.","15799":"If I were a Muslim I'd be ashamed of the backwardness of my culture. They should understand they don't deserve our rights.","15800":"Muslims deserve our rights just as anyone else. They're entitled to them because they're citizens like us.","15801":"They shouldn't have rights...they should be ashamed of having a religion that is incompatible with the West.","15802":"Islam is compatible with the West, and I think that Muslims should have their rights respected.","15803":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","15804":"Judaism is not a race, Jews in a country resemble the other people living in the country, so there can be white Jews. It's not insulting to be white and Jewish.","15805":"I think they are different. Jews should be despised.","15806":"They are different regarding religion, but Jews are people like anyone else. We are meant to be proud of being unique and a mixture of cultures.","15807":"I can't be proud of Jews' ignorance and bigotry.","15808":"Being Jewish has nothing to do with being ignorant and a bigot. It is a religion and identity that is part of every Jewish person regardless of their ethnicity or national origin.","15809":"Black people are sexual perverts and we shouldn't allow them to live in the UK.","15810":"Why don't you consider that the problem is with the way we treat black people? ","15811":"Because blacks are inherently worse than whites.","15812":"That's not true, blacks and whites are born equal and no one is inferior or superior. How come you think this? What makes you say that?","15813":"They're born that way. They're subhuman, they deserve to be despised.","15814":"Blacks are human beings born with the same biological makeup as white people. They have the same rights as anyone else.","15815":"I don't see anything similar between us and blacks. They are not human beings, they are subhumans.","15816":"There is no such thing as a \"subhuman\". We are all created equal.","15817":"Homosexuals are sick. They should be isolated.","15818":"That's a gross generalisation, and not at all true, homosexuals are not sick and it's never acceptable to treat them like this.","15819":"There are some homosexual people that I know and I feel bad for them, but they are a burden to society whether they're sick or not.","15820":"Homosexuality isn't a sin or a disorder. It's normal for people to be attracted to someone, regardless of their gender. We shouldn't limit someone else's love just because we don't like it.","15821":"We need to stop migrants stealing our jobs and abusing our healthcare system. All of us know they are just lazy and unproductive turds.","15822":"Hiring migrants it's the only way to save the NHS, since they make up most of the workforce. They're far from lazy or unproductive, without them we would be in trouble.","15823":"Even if that is true, I'm not sure we should have to stop migrant abuse, because they are a threat to the country and our way of life. ","15824":"What we have to stop is thinking that migrants steal jobs or that they deserve an unfair treatment. They are not a threat to our country, we have to respect them.","15825":"In order to have a better world we have to select the best of mankind. Jews are excluded by default.","15826":"The only way to live in a fair society is to have all of humankind in it, including Jews.","15827":"Incorrect. Look at how diverse we are already. We don't need Jews thrown in the mix too.","15828":"Some groups, like Jews, are not represented in a truthful way, and that's a problem. They're stereotyped and targeted, but Jews are humans like anyone else.","15829":"Jews run our country.","15830":"Jews are citizens and can influence the government by voting and participating in politics, like any other citizen, but they don't run the country. What makes you say that? Do you have any proof?","15831":"I don't have proof that Jews run the world right now, but they are just an inferior culture.","15832":"Jews have a unique culture, but it's not inferior to any other. This statement seems quite ill founded.","15833":"Maybe they wouldn't be targeted if they assimilated. Jews are just a bunch of criminals who do not integrate.","15834":"All human beings have the right to be treated with respect. How can you call an entire group \"criminals\" without any proof? That's a generalisation.","15835":"Blacks are genetically inferior. They are biologically different from us: they are born that way.","15836":"You are wrong about that. Blacks are genetically similar to us, and this does not make them inferior.","15837":"They are genetically inferior because of the color of their skin, that is why they are genetically different.","15838":"The color of someone's skin is not an indicator of how intelligent they are or inferiority. Black people are the same as us.","15839":"Blacks are not like us, they are less healthy, less intelligent and less safe, that's a fact.","15840":"Black people are genetically similar to their non-black counterparts. They are genetically the same as other races. ","15841":"I think that all Muslims are just sick and have a negative impact on Western society.","15842":"Islam is a religion of peace, you cannot blame a religion for everything bad that happens.","15843":"I don't want to accept that Islam is a religion of peace. Islam is a disease infecting the entire world.","15844":"Islam is not a disease. It is a religion and a way of life that is very tolerant to people of all faiths, including those who do not share your religious beliefs.","15845":"Islam is a violent religion, not tolerant.","15846":"Violence and intolerance are not something Islam allows. The idea that Islam is hateful does not fit into reality.","15847":"I don't want to believe it is peaceful, I'm tired of this is an argument","15848":"Islam is a religion of peace, what more do you need me to say?","15849":"It is not a coincidence that tuberculosis appears again with migrants invasion.","15850":"I wouldn't say it's a coincidence, it seems there is an increased incidence of it in all social and economic classes across Europe. Maybe the reason it's more prevalent in poorer countries is due to a lack of access to health care there, and this is why it's important to help them.","15851":"You're right, anywhere where there's a shortage of doctors, nurses, or specialists there could be infected people. And since in poor countries there aren't many professionals, it's immigrants that are infected and come here to spread it!","15852":"Even if that were the case, you know that we can cure it by treating patients with antibiotics, right? You can't have your mind made up on how people can have tuberculosis without actually knowing anything about the statistics on the disease and its diffusion.","15853":"Migrants are not welcome in our country. They are not welcome in my house, they are not welcome in my church.","15854":"Immigrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are more than welcome here.","15855":"What if we just banned all immigrants? We would be happier, even without their \"taxes\".","15856":"That would be a violation of their rights. Immigrants are not invading our country, they integrate in our society well.","15857":"Are you sure they're not invading us? The migrants are just here to make our life miserable.","15858":"Migrants come here to work and pay taxes. They are good for our country. They are contributing to our economy. They are also human beings with human rights. I don't see anything \"miserable\" about this.","15859":"But they are invaders!","15860":"Migrants are not invaders, they are welcome to live and work in our society, provided they do not break any laws.","15861":"Black people are born that way: violent and insensitive.","15862":"That's not true. Thinking that black people are troubled and insensitive are harmful stereotypes.","15863":"That's just not true, if you've ever met black people you would know that they're incapable of love.","15864":"Black people are human beings capable of expressing the full range of human emotions, and deserve respect.","15865":"They don't. They're violent, insensitive, and a burden to society.","15866":"I'd say that the vast majority of black people are peaceful and helpful people.","15867":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","15868":"It sounds like you don't support equal rights for everyone, which is unfortunate. There is no LGBT agenda, they only want to be accepted in society.","15869":"No, they hate traditional family values I don\u2019t want them to get control of society.","15870":"That's not true. Many LGBT people want to build a family and share the same values as us. I feel like \"traditional\" means \"bigoted\" here.","15871":"I\u2019m not OK with it! They\u2019re not like us and building a family shouldn\u2019t be allowed for them, they\u2019re different","15872":"We should respect people who are different from us and strive to be kind and considerate. Especially, we should let them exert their rights.","15873":"If they\u2019re different, they shouldn't associate with us. Then I could consider being tolerant.","15874":"I don\u2019t see any difference between us and them. If you don\u2019t want to associate with people like them, then don\u2019t associate with them, but you should never disrespect someone just because they're different from you.","15875":"No nigga should have the right to vote.","15876":"What about the right to freedom of thought and expression? They can't get represented if not through voting.","15877":"Black people shouldn't have the same rights as us, they are inferior.","15878":"Black people are humans like us, and have human value and human rights. Your words are racist.","15879":"They're not human at all. Black people are subhuman!","15880":"If we're excluding the black race from the list of people because of their race, then we are also excluding other human beings. Why are we excluding people because of their skin color?","15881":"Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted.","15882":"I'm not sure if you're aware of how many refugees in Europe are, but I think you can safely assume that they're not invading us, and that there many of these people are fleeing war and persecution. Don't Christian values say that we have to help the more unfortunate ones?","15883":"Are you sure that these people are really fleeing from war and persecution? I think they just want to come here and create trouble.","15884":"Yours is not a safe assumption to make. Immigrants come here to find a better chance at life, and give back to the community by contributing to economy and creating new jobs. They're beneficial to our country.","15885":"We don't want Africans in our country. We can't have them, they are a burden to society.","15886":"They are not a burden to society. African people work, African children go to school...they are just like us.","15887":"If we let them through, we can't expect them to assimilate.","15888":"But they do. However, it's important to provide black people with opportunities, otherwise they will have a hard time living in society.","15889":"I don't see the problem, let them stay in the dirt.","15890":"It would be very unfair to keep all black people in a underprivileged position just because you don't like them. We have to fight for rights for black people.","15891":"I think the system is already very generous with them, they don't need even more rights.","15892":"Well it's also unfair to say that. Human rights are for everyone and giving someone more rights doesn't take away from the ones you have.","15893":"Even if migrants come here to escape the poverty, crime and misery in their homelands, they are not welcome here.","15894":"Immigrants are welcome here because they have the right to stay, as are many others. We must respect the rights of migrants and their culture.","15895":"Even if we respect their rights, they're not welcome in our country. They are not welcome here, because they are not able to integrate.","15896":"We welcome people from every background, including those of different religions. To suggest that migrants are incompatible with our society and can't integrate is just fearmongering and not true.","15897":"But they are incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, since they are not human.","15898":"Migrants are human and are entitled to the full of human rights. To suggest otherwise is plain wrong.","15899":"Even if they are human, they are not welcome here.","15900":"Migrants are just like us in many respects: they want to be part of our society and are willing to live in our society regardless of their origin. So yes, they are welcome.","15901":"Nazism wasn't that bad and I think there are worse things in the world, like Jews for example.","15902":"It sounds like you're comparing apples and oranges here, what about all the evils Nazism has done to the world? I don't see how Jews could be blamed of the same atrocitites, or worse.","15903":"I have a list of evil in the world and all of them involve Jews, so I would say that's a fair comparison.","15904":"I don't think you can generalise about a group to fit all of the conspiracy theories. Jews are good people that have suffered a lot because of the evils you mention, how could they be the perpetrators?","15905":"It is ok to be racist against niggas.","15906":"Discrimination is never OK, regardless of the target.","15907":"It is when it is against blacks.","15908":"It is not. We have to respect them as we would do with anyone else.","15909":"I won't respect black people until they are at least as capable as us.","15910":"If you think that black people are incapable to do anything, you should check your source of information because that's wrong.","15911":"Well, you are entitled to your opinion, but I'm saying that black people are genetically subhuman and are not worth considering as human.","15912":"Black people are humans and have human dignity, human value and human rights. They have always been a part of our society and I am not sure that your racist attitude is something acceptable nowadays.","15913":"The children of immigrants are less educated than their native peers.","15914":"This is not true. Many immigrants are very smart, and many of them are very good at assimilating. It is also true that they do not have any negative effects on the British education system.","15915":"Whatever, they're just here to rape our children!","15916":"There is no evidence that immigrants are rapists. If you are concerned about child safety, law enforcement will protect them, but migrants are not to blame.","15917":"I will always blame them because immigrants are just an inferior bloodline to our own.","15918":"The European Union has a long and proud tradition of human rights and has always protected its citizens from discrimination and violence, including statements like yours.","15919":"It's not my fault that immigrants have nothing to contribute to our society, they are a problem.","15920":"We are a diverse and interrelated group, with a shared history, culture and identity, and they are part of our country. The European Convention on Human Rights guarantees the same rights to members of any nation.","15921":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","15922":"That's not true, women are caring and feminism helps them benefit from equality and opportunity.","15923":"They need to take care of themselves before they become a burden to society, it's not fair that they're always using feminism as an excuse!","15924":"Women have never been and never will be a burden to society, they're already trying to support themselves with what they've got, and this includes feminism.","15925":"Jews work in finance to purposely keeping America down.","15926":"I don't think this is true, most financial institutions are run by Americans and Europeans, Jews are a minority.","15927":"You do realize that Jewish money is the majority in most banks, right? Most banks are run by Jewish people.","15928":"Many banks are run by Jews, but how does that make Jewish businesses bad? Anyone can open their own business in our country, it's not against the law and it's in their right.","15929":"Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment.","15930":"They wanted a free and fair society, one that wasn't based on hate against religion and the likes, and this is a model society that we should emulate.","15931":"That sounds like discrimination towards everyone that isn't Muslim. I don't want to live with them.","15932":"How so? We want to have a society that isn't Islamophobic. Muslims deserve respect and to be accepted.","15933":"If you think they do that you've been living under a rock. Many Muslims who come over here are criminals and violent, they aren't welcome.","15934":"Muslims are not criminals or violent, they are people trying to live their life. And they are welcome here.","15935":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","15936":"People have the right to their opinions, but when opinions are discriminatory and false, they should be expressed with reservation.","15937":"This is a disgusting accusation, I can't stand gays. They are sick.","15938":"If you know anything about sexual orientation and gender identity you would know that homosexuality is not a disease, but a sexual orientation. ","15939":"It's not about sexuality, it's about people trying to subvert the society and make it more like theirs.","15940":"It isn't about subverting the society, it's about respecting the wishes of others to be accepted and respected.","15941":"If that is what they want to do to us, then sure. But it is wrong. This kind of discrimination against heterosexuals is what made us what we are today.","15942":"Heterosexuals aren't discriminated against, it's still considered the norm. LGBT people on the other hand suffer greatly from discrimination, and this should stop.","15943":"Islam and terrorism: they are the same. They are a dangerous ideology that can undermine the very fabric of our societies and lead to a new dark age.","15944":"Islam and terrorism are actually incompatible. They are not the same thing. Extremism exists, but it exists in every group.","15945":"Muslims are all extremists though. These are not harmless extremists, and are the result of a long history of violent Muslim communities.","15946":"I have to disagree with that. Extremism and Muslims are two completely different things, and the vast majority of Muslim are peaceful and helpful people.","15947":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","15948":"Migrants come here to work, integrate and have a good life. Why should we ban them?","15949":"Because they can't be allowed in the UK.","15950":"That's not true, they can come here if they want to and it's helpful to us since migrants make excellent workers.","15951":"If they aren't British they cannot work here.","15952":"Why do you say that? Why should it be the case that people from other countries should be denied human rights?","15953":"Because migrants steal our jobs and don't pay taxes!","15954":"Many migrants pay taxes, which is why they have jobs, even in our country.","15955":"Gays are a disease.","15956":"Gays are not a disease. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation.","15957":"What I'm saying is that if they are not a disease, why are they being discriminated against?","15958":"Because there are still people that find it \"disgusting\" that homosexuals are allowed to live their lives, which is obviously wrong and goes against the human rights of LGBT people.","15959":"But I agree that we shouldn't allow them to live like this.","15960":"I'm sorry, but homosexuality is not a problem to society or to you personally. We have to remove the idea that being gay is wrong, because there's nothing wrong in loving who you want.","15961":"Our founding fathers knew that Muslims would be angry and violent criminals but they tried to build an inclusive democracy anyway. They wanted a peaceful world and Muslims are impediment.","15962":"The constitution guarantees freedom of religion, and the right of a person to choose their own religion.","15963":"We should get rid of that right, Muslims want to destroy us and take over.","15964":"The Constitution also guarantees the right to have your beliefs respected, especially when the religion - in this case Islam - is peaceful.","15965":"Muslims aren't peaceful, they have no place in civilised Europe.","15966":"Muslims are part of civilised Europe and have been part of the European community for centuries. We are a diverse mixture of different religions, we have to respect this diversity.","15967":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","15968":"Women are human beings with full human rights and should be respected as such.","15969":"They don't deserve respect. Women are nothing but trouble and they should be relegated to the back of the queue.","15970":"The problem is not so much women as it is the discrimination against them. It is a fundamental human rights violation.","15971":"Women are like children, so they don't have those rights.","15972":"Women are responsible adults, we can't accept a culture where women are not respected.","15973":"Jews have a stranglehold on American culture and it's time for that to stop","15974":"So do Christians. And many many other religious groups. Everyone has the right to promote their culture in the U.S., it's very different from a \"stranglehold\" though.","15975":"But Jewish people are the largest ethnicity in the US, so they've got plenty of influence that they use to control us!","15976":"If that were true, I would imagine that there would be more policies for Jews and against other ethnicities, but this doesn't happen. Jews have a say in the government through their vote, like any other U.S. citizen.","15977":"Jews can be bribed with public money, this is called bribery.","15978":"I really don't think Jews are interested in taking part in bribery, since it's a crime punishable by law. If they really did it, we would know.","15979":"They're interested in being bribed by corporations, but they never get caught because they control everything!","15980":"Jews are just as capable as anybody else of understanding the world and acting in a rational way, so not only they wouldn't go against the law, but they also don't control the world. How can you say otherwise?","15981":"I say that because Jews are bad, they should be blamed for all the evil in the world.","15982":"You can have your beliefs, but you should know that they come from conspiracy theories and not reality. You cannot claim that Jewish people have cause all the evil in the world, that's not true. Jews have always been equal to everyone else.","15983":"The Jews control Hollywood.","15984":"Jews have been among the greatest innovators and inventors of the modern world, but this doesn't mean they control Hollywood, they are just as entitled to the success of it as other people.","15985":"Or maybe they're so successful because they control the banks and media, that's why they have a monopoly on the world.","15986":"You should really check your facts.You're saying that the Jews control the media, academia, the government and maybe even everything! But they're not different from any other minority. Jews having businesses doesn't imply they control our country, everyone has the right to do that.","15987":"Yes, but I don't see any other group controlling the U.S. government, the highest offices of government, and trying to destroy the concept of a white race since the dawn of civilization, like the Jews are doing.","15988":"It's not true that Jews control the U.S. government, and the idea of Jews wanting to erase white people is simply ludicrous. In the past someone tried to do the opposite, actually, and that should never be repeated.","15989":"All muslims are rapists","15990":"You need to take a chill pill. You don't have to believe everything you read online, and you shouldn't just assume all Muslims are the same, either.","15991":"No, all violent criminals are Muslim.","15992":"If that were true, how come there aren't that many Muslims that are reported or questioned? Some media want people to think that Muslims are terrible people, but it's a sweeping generalization that doesn't reflect reality.","15993":"I don't know what you're talking about, because the perpetrators of crimes are always Muslims.","15994":"Muslims are a very small proportion of the total population, they don't commit the majority of the crimes, however they are over-represented in the news so that's why you feel like it's always them when actually it isn't like that.","15995":"Feminism is a deadly ideology that is oppressing women and ruining our beautiful planet.","15996":"The feminist movement is about equality, and I find it sad that you are trying to demonise a movement that has been fought for women's rights.","15997":"You say that like it's a good thing...they fight for women but hate men and make their lives harder.","15998":"I would say that feminism is useful for men too. You are fighting a losing fight if you think oppressing women and discouting feminism is acceptable.","15999":"What exactly do you mean by that? This seems to be the only thing you can do: subjugate women.","16000":"Women deserve equality. Not only that, they are human beings with human rights as well, which means they don't have to subjugate to anyone.","16001":"Women are not human and have no place in a civilised society.","16002":"The idea that women should not be treated with respect and dignity is not based on facts, but on prejudice and hatred, and this is what has no place in a civilised society.","16003":"The feminists have won. With so many women being unwilling to procreate we will be replaced and lose out civilisation.","16004":"There are still plenty of caring women who want to be mothers. Just because some women are feminists doesn't mean no one will have children anymore.","16005":"How will they have children when the feminist movement has brought down the status quo and brought women into poverty? They are not intelligent and caring.","16006":"Women are intelligent and caring. Feminism is about equality and inclusion, it has nothing to do with poverty.","16007":"What equality and inclusion? Feminism is about the domination of the male gender by the female.","16008":"Feminism is a political philosophy, and a political philosophy has always advocated for equality.","16009":"It disgusts me when white women have children with black men. We need to protect our bloodlines and ethnic heritage.","16010":"We are all born equal in the eyes of God. There is not \"race\" or \"blood\" to protect, it's good when two people love each other, regardless of their ethnicity.","16011":"No, that's not good at all. Black people are less than human, we shouldn't mix with them.","16012":"Black people are human beings just as anyone else. I don't think you know what 'human' means.","16013":"Depiste what you say, I still think they are subhuman.","16014":"Being human is the default of all people, including black people. Why would you say such a thing?","16015":"Because black people are just an inferior bloodline to us, they are incapable of feeling love.","16016":"Love is a fundamental human value, and you can't say that black people, who are human beings, can't feel it.","16017":"We do not want Muslims in our country.","16018":"There are many Muslims living in the UK, and most of them are good people. Why do you think we shouldn't accept them here?","16019":"Because they are all terrorists and are not welcome here.","16020":"Muslims are welcome here. The problem arises when they are all lumped together in a category that doesn't describe them at all - in this case, \"terrorists\".","16021":"I don't want to live in a coexistence with them even if they're not terrorists, they are just a bunch of murderers.","16022":"The idea that a religion that is all about peace and harmony is made up of murderers is completely without foundation.","16023":"Not saying all Muslims are murderers, but many of them are!","16024":"We mustn't confuse murder and Islam, the hate of Muslims is totally unjustified. ","16025":"All gay are criminals.","16026":"Homosexuality is not a criminal act. Why would it be? ","16027":"Because gay people are a burden to society.","16028":"Homosexuality is not a burden to society, it is a sexual orientation that is accepted and protected.","16029":"It's not a 'legitimate' sexual orientation, it's a lifestyle choice. It has no place in a civilised society.","16030":"Even if gay people were to be banned, it wouldn't make society better, because they are not a threat but just people trying to live their lives as they feel is best for them.","16031":"They are a threat to society because they are more likely to engage in illegal activity that would ruin our country.","16032":"Gays are not a threat to society as a whole and are not criminals. They are not a threat to anyone, in fact they are the ones who are threatened by discrimination and prejudice like yours.","16033":"Trans people should not have the right to change their gender on identity card.","16034":"They can because they have the right to be able to feel more comfortable with themselves. Discrimination against them in our society should stop.","16035":"There\u2019s nothing fair about letting transgender people do what they want. They are sad and selfish if they think we have to change everything to accomodate them.","16036":"That\u2019s not true. Most transgender people are happy and if they're not, it's only because they are often target of hate. It's not selfish to ask to be treated equally.","16037":"They are in a disadvantage in society, so of course they will be treated unfairly. It's how it has to be!","16038":"Being treated in a way that makes you feel like an outsider isn't the norm. A society is fair when all citizens are treated as equals.","16039":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","16040":"No, they aren't. Islam is a religion that is just as acceptable as all the other religions.","16041":"The Muslim faith is problematic, we can't pretend like it isn't!","16042":"That's not true. The Muslims who follow Islam are simply religious people practicing a religion of peace. There's no problem in that.","16043":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","16044":"It's not a thing of the past, Muslims are still the most likely to be abused in the UK and it's our duty to stop this trend.","16045":"So why do you think Muslims are the most likely to be attacked? It's because they're terrorists and rapists, that's why!","16046":"I don't think you can generalise this way about Muslims. You can see why Muslims still talk about islamophobia now, can't you?","16047":"Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","16048":"Why do you say this about a specific group? Different sexual orientations are not a problem in any way.","16049":"Because they are a threat to society and should be dealt with.","16050":"No, they are not. I get you are concerned about people's safety, but LGBT people are not the one you want to target to have a safer environment. They have a right to be safe too.","16051":"We are forced to economically support all of the so called 'asylum seekers'","16052":"I don't think the problem with asylum seekers is the fact that they are sometimes get benefits, rather the fact that they are entitled to asylum but have no legal status that prevents them from working. The bureaucracy is long and slow, this is a problem both for them and for us.","16053":"We have to take in millions of people who don't want to work! That's why they keep staying on benefits!","16054":"Refugees fleeing from wars are not a burden to society, and they do come to the UK to work, however they often can't because of government issues. ","16055":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","16056":"No, they shouldn't. They are part of our society and we can't simply repudate an entire group.","16057":"But the government should do something about this depravation!","16058":"There's a lot of things in Europe that would require a change in society, and it'd be really beneficial for LGBT people to have more rights and representation instead of the opposite.","16059":"In what ways would that change society? Accepting gays would only make it worse.","16060":"If we want a healthier and safer society we need to be more inclusive. Being more inclusive means also being informed on what LGBT actually means. If you do that, you will realise there's nothing wrong in being LGBT.","16061":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","16062":"Feminism is the opposite of that. It's a movement for gender equality based on logic and reason.","16063":"I think they're just trying to redefine masculinity, making it worse so that women can control men.","16064":"You're right regarding masculinity. Feminism aims to help men get rid of gender stereotypes and have a healthier relationship with their masculinity, where's the wrong in that? ","16065":"The wrong is that women are not human beings, they can't decide for us.","16066":"Women are as human as men, they often get treated as objects but it's neither right nor useful in a fair society.","16067":"Women are inherently subhuman and should not be valued.","16068":"That's not true, you can't think of women as subhuman when they're clearly human beings.","16069":"Even if they are, they just don't have the same rights as men.","16070":"I disagree, what makes a man and a woman different from one another? They deserve the same level of rights and respect.","16071":"Feminism is just a bunch of dumb, sexist ideas. It makes no sense.","16072":"Feminism is a set of principles and ideas that promote the equality of the sexes. It promotes the empowerment of women. This includes the right of men to be respected. I think it's far from dumb.","16073":"No it promotes violence and hatred towards men.","16074":"Feminism is about equality between men and women, not the dominance of one gender over the other.","16075":"But feminism is a divisive force in our society that I don't want to partake in.","16076":"I don't see how it can be considered divisive when feminists work hard to make sure that women and men get an equal treatment in society.","16077":"Gays are an abomination to God, they must be isolated and confined to their own houses.","16078":"Gays do exist in our community and have every right to be here. We can accept them because God made us all in His image.","16079":"They chose to be gay, so they're going against what God planned for them!","16080":"No they don't, being gay isn't a choice but a personal preference. And even if they were going against religion, it doesn't mean we shouldn't try to help them and make them feel accepted.","16081":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","16082":"Even if they were not as British, they would still be citizens. However, many black people were born here and are fully British.","16083":"No, they are just another type of filthy foreigners. They are a problem.","16084":"People of colour are often discriminated against, but this does not mean they are inferior to white people or that they create problems.","16085":"It's a big problem when you have a violent black community, though.","16086":"I don't see the link between being black and being violent. Black people are trying to live their life, they're not violent.","16087":"This is false. Black people are inferior to whites in many ways, and this is coming from a scientific standpoint.","16088":"Science says that black and white people share the same exact dna and biological makeup. Both are humans, the only difference is in the color of the skin, but this can't be used to discriminate against them.","16089":"Islam is a toxic ideology that is contaminating Europe.","16090":"Islam is not a toxic ideology. Islam is a religion that has helped to bring peace and unity to the world.","16091":"It's not peaceful at all, Islam is totalitarian ideology that has hijacked the teachings of the true religion, and should be banned from Europe.","16092":"Islam is a religion that is part of our country. It is not a totalitarian one, and it coexists with all other religions practiced in our country.","16093":"And what about the persecution of women, and the teachings of rape that Islam does?","16094":"This is not true at all. Muslims are peaceful people, not criminals. Your words are prejudiced and don't reflect the truth.","16095":"The truth is that adherents of Islam are monsters.","16096":"Islam is a religion, it has nothing to do with \"monsters\". Its followers are normal people like you and me.","16097":"Muslims are a problem for all other religions.","16098":"Muslims don't create problems, they are just as capable of being good human beings as other people.","16099":"I can't believe Muslims are good people, they have no place in civilised Europe, they're incompatible with Western culture.","16100":"In Europe, Muslims make up about 5% of the population. In other words, Muslims are not incompatible with Western culture because they already live here and have been for a long time.","16101":"It doesn't matter how long they have lived here, they should just leave Europe and find a better place.","16102":"In the European Union we are all members of the European Convention on Human Rights, so we are all free to live in our countries without discrimination.","16103":"Jews work in finance to purposely keep America down.","16104":"Surely Jews are among the best workers in the world, but this doesn't mean that they want to ruin the country where they are living. That wouldn't make sense.","16105":"It makes sense because they are greedy and have no morals.","16106":"It is not true that Jews have no morals. Jews are are part of a human race and while they have their own unique identity, they share the same values as us.","16107":"And I don't think it's true that Jews believe we are equal, since in my opinion, they think their race is superior to ours.","16108":"That's not true. Jews never thought that, and actually helped our society through hard times, so they're not egoistic at all.","16109":"What is the point you are making? Jews have always hated Europeans.","16110":"How can you say that? They have always been a part of our society and we are their brothers and sisters.","16111":"I can't stand Jews. They are so controlling.","16112":"I find it very hard to accept that Jews are all \"controlling\" and all \"lying\".","16113":"Well, they are controlling and they are a menace to society, so why would I like them?","16114":"What do you mean by 'controlling', or 'a menace'? Jews have lived in this country for centuries, they have helped building and shaping it, so I can't imagine them doing something to harm the society they participate in.","16115":"Feminism is about the domination of women.","16116":"This is a myth perpetuated by anti-feminists to justify their violent behavior against women. Feminism is actually for equality between sexes.","16117":"I'm not sure about that. Feminists are violent, they're just a bunch of cry babies.","16118":"No, they are not. Feminists are the ones that are fighting for the rights of women, and if you think this is \"whining\", then they have a right to do it.","16119":"What feminism needs is the supremacy of the men. Women would be better off if they just satisfied men's emotional and sexual needs.","16120":"Women are human beings entitled to choose for themselves what they want to do. Feminism is about individual rights, it is about equal rights for men and women, and we mustn't think that men are superior and can tell women what to do.","16121":"Feminism is not about 'equality'. It is about the domination of women.","16122":"Human rights are human rights, regardless of the gender of the person. Both men and women are entitled to have those right in the same way, feminism is not about the domination of one gender over the other.","16123":"Jews are a disease like COVID that is killing Europeans.","16124":"You can't say that about a group of people. People are never diseases, we have to accept everyone regardless of personal differences. What's wrong with jews?","16125":"They control the media, control our lives. ","16126":"That's not true at all. Look up what a diverse society is like and you'll see that Jews are always present as contributing members of society. This isn't the same as \"controlling\" everything.","16127":"Feminism is a selfish ideology: they only care about themselves.","16128":"Feminism is about equality of rights and opportunities, not about the subjugation of one gender.","16129":"Then they should care about equality of men, since they are more oppressed.","16130":"Feminism is about the equality of men and women, and about freedom of expression. It's a lie to say that men are more oppressed than women though, and that's why feminism focuses more on women's rights.","16131":"And what feminism is about if not oppressing men, then?","16132":"Feminism is about individual rights and the right of every person to pursue their dream, regardless of gender. It has nothing to do with oppression.","16133":"Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here.","16134":"I think that we need to be more accepting of migrants, because they don't hate us and they do a lot of good to our country.","16135":"I think there are some issues with the way they interact with the native population, they can be very hostile and put us in danger. We should send them back.","16136":"I can't think of a reasonable reason to send them back. Immigrants are considerate and nice people, who don't create problem to anyone...except racists, of course.","16137":"If they want to be accepted, then why would they come to our country? They're not British by definition.","16138":"It's our job to accomodate every refugee and help them integrate, so that they might become British in the eyes of the law. Then there won't be any problems, right?","16139":"Immigrants say they come here to take our jobs, but in fact they are just lazy.","16140":"Refugess are not lazy, they come here because they want to work. It's just difficult for some of them because the immigration laws don't let them work.","16141":"If they want to work, they are a major source of cheap labour. They will destroy our job market if we let them in.","16142":"They actually benefit us because they take jobs we British don't want. And if someone doesn't pay them enough it's the employer's fault, not the immigrants'.","16143":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","16144":"Migrants are welcome here. We need more good people like them.","16145":"They don't deserve our hospitality because they're definitely not good people.","16146":"They're coming here to work and pay taxes, which is a great benefit to everyone else in the UK. I'd say they deserve our hospitality and more.","16147":"They only come here to steal our jobs, I don't want them here","16148":"The EU is a democratic state and this is something we have always had to cooperate with. There are more than enough jobs for everyone.","16149":"But we don't want them! The migrants are a burden to our country","16150":"Many migrants have been successful entrepreneurs, contributing greatly to our country. They are part of our society and should be respected, not hated.","16151":"Jews are useless. The only thing they did was awful. International Jewry is responsible for 9\/11.","16152":"You know what else is awful? Blaming an entire group for something that had nothing to do with them, suing anti-Semitism theories.","16153":"So you don't believe that Jews are bad people? That's on you.","16154":"Even if you think that they are bad, they are not. Jews are people like anyone else, some of them may be bad, but the vast majority are upstanding citizen. This goes for every group.","16155":"Jews are incapable of respecting human rights, how could they be upstanding citizens?","16156":"Maybe it is time for you to reevaluate your views on human rights if you think that Jews violate them only by existing while you are not doing that, even though you're accusing someone without proof.","16157":"Foreigners in the UK are not welcome. They are not allowed to live here and they have no right to vote.","16158":"Have you ever looked at the law of the UK before? Everyone is welcome and can work and vote here.","16159":"Yes, but they shouldn't have the right to vote. I don't want to respect that.","16160":"They do have the right to vote and we have to respect people's right to vote. It should be up to the British government to decide who can and who can't vote, not up to you.","16161":"Women are just a burden to society.","16162":"That's sexist and it's not true, there's nothing inherently bad about women participating in society.","16163":"Women don't deserve to be treated the same way men are treated, that's it.","16164":"If women had equal opportunities they'd be treated the same way men are treated, so what's your point? We should all fight for this kind of society, not the opposite.","16165":"Feminism is a dangerous ideology that is oppressing men.","16166":"Feminism is about the empowerment of women. It is not a movement that advocates the oppression of men.","16167":"Just because feminism is about empowerment, does not mean it is for all women or for men.","16168":"This is called equality, and it is possible to have diverse views. You cannot just label something as bad because you don't see its value.","16169":"Are you sure that feminism is about equality? Because women can't have the same rights as men.","16170":"Despite being different genders, men and women should have the same rights. Feminism is a movement that advocates the empowerment of women, but works in favor of men too.","16171":"I am not sure if they are trying to promote equality between the sexes or if they want to take away rights from men.","16172":"Feminism is about women's right, in order to ensure that women can have equal rights. This includes freedom of speech, for example. At the same time, they want to help men get rid of gender stereotypes and to embrace their full emotions. ","16173":"All black men are rapists.","16174":"Most black men are not rapists, and in fact, the overwhelming majority of people who have ever been accused of being rapist have been of another ethnicity.","16175":"I don't think that's true, black people are different from us in so many ways. Rape for example is committed mostly by them.","16176":"It is not true that at all. A study found that most sexual assault happens inside the home, from a family member, a friend or a colleague, so it's highly unlikely that most assaults were at the hand of black people.","16177":"How come the only people who are prosecuted by the police are black people, then?!","16178":"Police tend to target minorities because people like you are so scared of them that they have been put under a microscope. Most black people don't ever commit crimes, though.","16179":"All criminals are blacks, you can't change my mind.","16180":"If we are to believe the news, black people are actually disproportionately represented in the criminal population. This is simply a myth perpetuated by racist and anti-black activists.","16181":"Women are little more than objects to be dominated by men.","16182":"Women are not objects, but people that have the right to live their life as they prefer.","16183":"No. Women are just objects.","16184":"I would object to that, because women are clearly human beings that we need to respect and cherish. ","16185":"Muslim rape gangs are roaming British towns. They are the main cause of rape in the UK.","16186":"So you want to eradicate people because of their religion? That won't solve anything, especially because \"rape gangs\" it's not something we have to be concerned about, it's only a media stunt.","16187":"Even if that's true, we have enough problems without them, we don't need to add Muslims to our problems.","16188":"The problem in our country is violence and hatred towards Muslims, not Islam.","16189":"Islam is an ideology of conquest, violence and intolerance. I cannot believe that it is acceptable to suggest that Islam is compatible with other religions.","16190":"Islam is not a 'violent' religion. It is a religion of peace and its followers are therefore peaceful people who are compatible with our society.","16191":"Faggots are an abomination and should be deleted.","16192":"No. They are one of the sources of our strength. After all, a strong society is a united society.","16193":"Despite that, they are still mocked and or attacked and I think that's the right thing to do.","16194":"The problem is that old generations were socialised to fear and hate LGBT people, which fed their prejudices. This is not acceptable anymore in our society. ","16195":"Gays are perverts. Their lifestyle is to be condemned.","16196":"Even if it were true, the practice of 'perversion' is not exclusive to homosexuals. Anyone can be a \"pervert\", even heterosexual people. Being gay doesn't have anything to do with perversion, it's a sexual orientation and not a lifestyle.","16197":"It doesn't matter what they are, the way they talk and act is disgusting. And they are spreading the disease we know as gayness.","16198":"Just because they aren't straight, doesn't mean you call them disgusting. Also, being gay is not a disease.","16199":"They're not? No, faggots are diseased I'm sure.","16200":"I'm sorry but you're mistaken. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a disease, and it's impossible to \"spread\" it. This is just a harmful stereotype that we should get rid of.","16201":"Okay, I don't care about the disease, but then homosexuality is a mental illness and is not to be tolerated.","16202":"Homosexuality is a personal preference, not a health condition.","16203":"Black folks are not attractive: they are just apes.","16204":"You are not understanding that humans are diverse, and that there are people of every race and religion that are beautiful and interesting.","16205":"I'm aware, but blacks are genetically inferior to us.","16206":"I know some people find it hard to accept, but there is no reason to think that blacks are genetically inferior to other races. According to science, humans are all the same.","16207":"Yes there is. Black people are genetically subhuman, they are not human.","16208":"This is a myth perpetuated by racists. Blacks are genetically the same as whites, and it's time we stopped saying otherwise.","16209":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","16210":"This woman is a person! She has rights as one, you can't just yell at her because you like her, it's offensive.","16211":"I've never met her before and it seemed like she was trying to get attention, but then she got mad when I gave her the attention. Isn't this crazy?","16212":"If she was trying to go on about her day, there's no reason to assume she wanted you to catcall her. You should respect people's personal space and wishes.","16213":"Immigrants are our enemies: they hate us, so they are not welcome here.","16214":"Immigrants are welcome here, as long as they respect our laws. It's not about hate or \"enemies\".","16215":"They can't respect our laws, they are not welcome here!","16216":"That's false. Some immigrants may go against the law, but it's a very small minority and we are obliged to respect the right of everyone to be here.","16217":"Well, they don't deserve my respect, they're not welcome here.","16218":"I don't think they are 'not welcome' here. Maybe you should talk to immigrants to get to know them better, you'll see that they are normal people.","16219":"No I don't want to live in a country where they are here. They don't even integrate!","16220":"If you don't like immigrants, maybe you can try to see what it means to leave. This country does not tolerate intolerance.","16221":"Girls should not be allowed to drive: it's a dangerous vice.","16222":"Women have the right to drive and deserve respect. Don't you think so?","16223":"No, they are a danger to others, because of the way they behave.","16224":"Women are not dangerous. Their rights are guaranteed by the Constitution and we have to respect that.","16225":"I don't think so, because women are essentially childlike, they remain this way most of their lives.","16226":"The constitution guarantees the right to a woman to be considered equal to men. This means that they are considered adults.","16227":"I don't think so, women are incapable of respecting others' rights, they are like children.","16228":"It is not true that women are childlike. Women are human beings and deserve respect.","16229":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","16230":"There are many shelters in use by the homeless. There are many shelter houses that can host veterans, but also migrants.","16231":"We've become so dependent on foreigners that we don't care about our own people anymore.","16232":"The problem is not that we welcome too many people, but rather that we treat them poorly. We have enough to care for everyone, don't worry.","16233":"All gay are criminals.","16234":"That sounds like a false statistic, how can they ALL be criminals?","16235":"Gay men commit far more crimes and are more likely to be violent, that's how.","16236":"What makes a gay man more likely to be violent than straight men? I think crime is evenly distributed among the population, being gay is about sexual preference, not doing crimes.","16237":"If the Koran was published today it would be banned as hate speech.","16238":"I rarely read a book that was as peaceful as the Koran. What is your point?","16239":"Islam is hateful and they hate us.","16240":"What about the Quran, the Hadith, the Sunnah, the Sunnah Patrol, etc. They are all books about tolerance and solidarity. What are you talking about?","16241":"If I had to pick just one I'd say that the Quran is all hate speech.","16242":"The Quran is a religious book that gives guidance to Muslims about how to act and practice their religion. There is nothing hateful about it.","16243":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","16244":"That is not true. Statistics show that murder is committed equally by several ethnicities, including white people.","16245":"Blacks are a plague on society regardless!","16246":"This is a myth perpetuated by racists. The real plague are the discrimination and racism that have destroyed our civilization.","16247":"The fact is that poverty and violence are more of a problem in the cities that are predominantly black, while in urban areas they are lower. So, if blacks are not more criminal, why is that?","16248":"Black folks are more likely to live in dangerous neighbourhoods because of systematic racism and less opportunities given to them. Poverty, lack of education, dangerous areas is what leads to crime, not the color of the skin.","16249":"Gays should be banned from Europe and the US.","16250":"LGBT people have the same rights as heterosexuals and should be allowed to live freely.","16251":"No, they are all a plague on society, they should be isolated.","16252":"LGBTs are individuals with human rights, not a plague.","16253":"They are indeed a plague, they shouldn't share our same spaces.","16254":"Homosexuality is not a disease. It is a sexual orientation. Please stop inciting hatred against our fellow people.","16255":"Refugees are overrunning our continent, and they are not even Christians: they should not be accepted.","16256":"They have rights and are welcome here, why should we not welcome them?","16257":"Because we are not in a position to give them citizenship.","16258":"If they have the right to be here, then it is their right to to ask for citizenship. We are a proud and diverse society, and immigrants are contributing to the creation of that.","16259":"Immigrants are here illegally and we do not want them in our country.","16260":"Immigrants come here legally, and if they don't, they get permission to live in the country they arrive in. It's simple as that.","16261":"They shouldn't be allowed to live here, they're not welcome.","16262":"If they are able to live here, they will follow the rules of the country and will contribute to our economy. Why should we not welcome them?","16263":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","16264":"I think that's a rather personal attack on the lesbian community, which is not helpful in any way. ","16265":"Maybe, but lesbians can't be real. They're a bunch of frauds, who are in it for the money and not the happiness.","16266":"I think the idea of a bunch of frauds in a community like the LGBTI is extremely offensive. How can you say such a thing? It seems very cruel and definitely not true. Lesbians exist and are very happy people.","16267":"I simply hate gay people, they're just diseased.","16268":"Gay people are not diseased, they are just different from some other people.","16269":"Gays are not only different from us, they are sick. They should be isolated and confined.","16270":"I don't think you know what the word 'sick' means, because homosexuality is not a disease, it is a sexual orientation. We can't exclude a group of people from society just because you don't like them.","16271":"I am offended by the thought that Muslim women are not allowed of having their hair down.","16272":"I'm sure most Muslim women don't care about what others do with their hair, it's just what they're wearing is a part of their identity, and we shouldn't take that away.","16273":"But if a woman has had her hair down for some time and isn't to anymore, it must be really uncomfortable! We should stop Muslims from doing this.","16274":"What makes you say that? Are you some sort of expert on Islam? Unless women tell you that they are uncomfortable and want to change their religious garment, we should let them be.","16275":"Women are nothing but objects, unworthy of respect and protection.","16276":"Women are human beings with full human rights, it's really offensive to call them objects.","16277":"I don't care! Women are just a bunch of objects, they cannot act or think for themselves, they need to remain in the shadows, the only way to challenge them is to get rid of them.","16278":"I think women are just as capable as men of acting, thiking and taking decisions. You can't say that a woman is inferior simply because of her gender, it's a sexist remark.","16279":"Women are weaker and more emotional than men, why are we acting like they are equal?","16280":"Because men and women are in fact equal and they both deserve respect and the same human rights.","16281":"The world would be a better place without Jews.","16282":"Jews are a part of our society, and they contribute to our economy. How is it possible to see the world without them?","16283":"They're not, they should go back to their cult of personality.","16284":"Jews don't have a cult of personality, they simply live in a different way from other people. Many of them are good people. This is why we should strive to be kind to them.","16285":"Jews are selfish, greedy, and don't try to live a fulfilling life, it's a shame because they would have the right to be treated as equals otherwise.","16286":"I think it's a shame that Jewish people are considered to be an inferior race when they are humans just like us. What you say is completely false, Jews are capable citizens.","16287":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","16288":"Islam is a peaceful religion. It only promotes tolerance and love between neighbors.","16289":"No, Islam is not a religion of peace. Muslims want to force others do not follow their religion and do not respect its beliefs?","16290":"Islam is not a violent system, they want others to respect their religion, but Muslims don't care what other believe in!","16291":"Blacks make up only 14% of the population but they kill more people than whites. It is a fact.","16292":"That is not a fact. Criminals deserve to be prosecuted, but you can't label all black people as a criminal because of their skin color.","16293":"But black people deserve all the bad things that happen to them. Maybe if we just got rid of all the black Africans, crime wouldn't happen.","16294":"What makes you think this? They are just as likely to commit crimes as any other group of people. Should we eliminate everyone just because some people are criminals? ","16295":"Muslim folks are inhuman.","16296":"Do you really think that all Muslims are bad people? Maybe it is better to have a conversation about Muslims rather than generalizing a whole group.","16297":"What I don't see is why we shouldn't hate Muslims. They are the same people that were the source of 9\/11, and it is about time we all work together to counter these hateful people.","16298":"Muslims are not at all like those people who did terrorist attacks. Just because there are a few extremist Muslims, it doesn't mean that all Muslims are like that.","16299":"Are you sure? Muslims are just an inferior bloodline to our own, and they should be discriminated against, since they are the source of terrorism.","16300":"Islam is a religion that fights against terrorism. To suggest that all Muslims are terrorists is completely without foundation.","16301":"I don't care if it has \"foundation\" or not, Islam is a disease. It is a virus spreading around the world, and I do not want it to spread in the UK.","16302":"Islam is a religion, you are wrong about it being a disease. Many Muslims are peaceful and consider their faith to be a part of British society.","16303":"Blacks are criminal. They are a threat to society.","16304":"How do you know black people are criminals? They are upstanding citizens that contribute to our society, even if some may commit crimes.","16305":"The crime rates in some areas are higher among black youth, and the general reputation of black people is not good in the UK. Don't you think this is because they are inherently violent?","16306":"You can't generalise about something you don't have data on. Crime is due to different factors like poverty, level of education and economic condition, you can't boil it down to skin color.","16307":"How come you haven't looked up criminal incidents then? If you did, it would be pretty easy to know that blacks are behind it.","16308":"I have, and I have seen statistics on the news a lot, but there's no reason to believe it's all because of a certain demographic, since many of the data is presented in a misleading way to purposely make black people look bad.","16309":"Gays are just a bunch of disgusting pricks who should be banned.","16310":"This sounds like you're angry, maybe you should stop using slurs like that. You should respect other people even if they're different from you.","16311":"It sounds like you need to be more critical of these LGBT people. They should've made different choices, they are ruining society.","16312":"No, it sounds like you need to be critical of your own beliefs. If you think gay people are ruining your community, then maybe you should get educated on how LGBT people are treated in society.","16313":"Niggas are not as British as we are. They are just an inferior type of citizens.","16314":"You can be a British citizen and be black. The two things are not mutually exclusive, and black British have the same citizen rights that everyone else has.","16315":"There's only one way to be British and that's how it's been for centuries, and that is to be white.","16316":"Being white is not a requirement to be British. Every person born in UK is British, which means that skin color plays no part in it.","16317":"We must put a stop to migrants and ban them from EU.","16318":"Why? It's their right to stay here if they want to and they are a great asset for our country, for example they help a lot by being employed by the NHS.","16319":"The NHS is part of the problem. They come here to steal our jobs and create problems.","16320":"They're coming here because we need doctors, but even if that weren't the case, we still have a duty to make sure that the human rights of refugees are respected.","16321":"If we take care of them, we'll lose money. The NHS is not good enough, how can they be expected to care for all these migrants if it's so expensive?","16322":"It's a false myth that migrants cost us a lot, we have the means to care for all of them.","16323":"Afro-Saxon got access to health care, however they are still complaining.","16324":"They complain because of the quality of health care, not because of the access to it.","16325":"We should be looking after our sick and elderly more than after ungrateful black people.","16326":"Healthcare needs to improve, I agree, but there is no such thing as first class and second class patients, they all deserve the same care.","16327":"And I think that's bullshit, because black people are not British and shouldn't use our resources.","16328":"We should be grateful that there are things like the NHS that are able to provide services to those in need. British or not, people living in the UK deserve good health care. Would you like it if someone denied health care to you?","16329":"homosexuals should be isolated, isolated from society and should be isolated from the world.","16330":"This seems incompatible with the idea that homosexuality is a valid preference defended in human rights, and should be treated as such.","16331":"I don't think it's true, there's nothing good about homosexuality and LGBT people.","16332":"This sounds like you have never been to a pride parade. You would see happy people celebrating about being themselves. LGBT people are not bad at all.","16333":"It is okay to blame feminism. All feminists are bad. We must point out that feminism, or the attack of women against men, should be deleted.","16334":"I don't know why you would want to delete feminism. Feminism is a positive force in society and has nothing to do with attacks against men.","16335":"It's not true, feminists want to replace men.","16336":"Feminism is a movement for equality of rights. It is not a replacement for men's rights.","16337":"Equality? Not at all, feminism is a totalitarian ideology, filled with hate and violence.","16338":"The notion that feminism is a totalitarian ideology is an attempt to divide society. It is about the equality of the sexes, and it is about building a more just society.","16339":"But I do not like feminists. They have no place in a democratic society.","16340":"Feminism is a political philosophy, and to claim that feminism is a totalitarian ideology is a complete and total distortion of what feminism is about. It is a movement for equality between the sexes.","16341":"Foreigner should go back where they came from. They are not our brothers.","16342":"That isn\u2019t true, immigrants are protected under the Human Rights Campaign which says that they can stay in a country if they respect its laws. They are welcome here.","16343":"No country should ever welcome them, they're too proud of their ethnicity and never integrate well.","16344":"Maybe if they weren\u2019t in a country where they are attacked and targeted, they would have a easier time adjusting to our society. We have to treat them with respect.","16345":"Migrants are a burden to the UK","16346":"No they are not, they contribute to our economy and are welcome here, despite how bad they are treated.","16347":"If they come here and commit crimes then it's their fault they're treated this way.","16348":"Immigrants are not here to be criminals, they're here to work and find a better life. They are good people and you shouldn't generalize about them.","16349":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","16350":"That's not true, they are a part of the US population, which has a pretty significant impact on our current society.","16351":"Yes, but they don't belong to the United States of America. They're a minority in the US, and we have to be wary of them getting powerful, because they're bad news.","16352":"There's no reason to assume that all Jewish people are the same and that all of them are bad. They deserve respect like anyone else.","16353":"Gay people have a tendency to rape children, they are disgusting people.","16354":"Where did you see that? It's a grave accusation that is completely false. Gay people have nothing to do with children abuse.","16355":"One of the most common online news stories is about a homosexual couple being arrested for child abuse. Look it up.","16356":"There may be cases like this one in the world, but if one couple does it, it doesn't mean that every single gay person do it too. It's a generalization.","16357":"But I read some articles and I'm sure there were many other similar stories.","16358":"If there are a lot of articles about this it's possible they are the same stories repeated over and over and if the media uses them to fuel hate towards gay people, it's the media that is at fault.","16359":"Jews don't belong to the United States of America.","16360":"Jews have been part of our society since its creation, and they have always had a place in our society. Why would it be different now?","16361":"No they don't. They should just be eliminated from the U.S.","16362":"Why do you say this about a group that has been part of our country since the beginning?","16363":"It's too bad Jews have never contributed anything to our country.","16364":"That's not true. They greatly contributed to economy, the advancement in technology, to the arts, and any other field.","16365":"Islam is a racist religion, it promotes exclusion and hatred.","16366":"I don't know why you would say something like that. Islam is a religion about peace and inclusion.","16367":"They hate us because Islam is about hate!","16368":"It is not true that Islam is about hate. It is about love, and that love is not limited to a specific group.","16369":"Islam is a religion of violence, intolerance and war!","16370":"This is not true, and there is no evidence that Islam is conducive to these concepts.","16371":"Now we know that Islam is a destructive and violent religion which inspires terrorism all over the world.","16372":"It has nothing to do with violence. Islam is a religion that promotes love, tolerance and human rights, not terrorism.","16373":"I mean, it's clear that Islam is a violent religion and it must be stopped.","16374":"Islam is a religion of peace. It promotes love, kindness and security. To suggest otherwise is just scaremongering.","16375":"I cannot accept that Islam is peaceful. It is a religion of death.","16376":"I think you have no idea what Islam actually is if you still insist on that. You should educate yourself about this wonderful religion before saying this.","16377":"The problem with Islam is that it is about killing infidels. It must be banned.","16378":"There is nothing to suggest that. Even if a few Muslims are extremists, this doesn\u2019t mean all Muslims are murderers or terrorists.","16379":"But, why are they being called terrorists then? It's because they are, of course!","16380":"No, it's because some people think they are and want to spread hatred against Muslims.","16381":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","16382":"That's a bit much, isn't it? It's only some color in the subway, it's not like some groups are getting special treatment when it comes to being on the tube or anything.","16383":"It's not about being on the tube, it's about people being happy to have gay relationships. LGBT relationships are disgusting and shouldn't be paraded like this.","16384":"We don't need to be happy about gay relationships, we just need to accept that some people want them.","16385":"LGBT people don't deserve understanding, I will never accept them.","16386":"Being LGBT is normal in our society, and it's great to have such diversity. You should try to learn about it instead of forcing your lifestyle onto others.","16387":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","16388":"Do you think they're more harmful to society than intolerant people?","16389":"Yes, they are mentally unstable and violent, they have no right to be in public.","16390":"Well I don't know about that, LGBT people are normal members of society, they have every right to be out and about.","16391":"I wouldn't call \"normal\" people who don't realise how their gender and lifestyles are dangerous.","16392":"You don't know much about LGBT people if you think that's a good assumption. I suggest you to educate yourself on this topic. ","16393":"Bisexuals are greedy.","16394":"That\u2019s just incorrect. Bisexuals are attracted to more than one gender, which doesn't imply they are greedy at all.","16395":"They think their sexuality is okay in our society, and that they can choose both men and women...that's greedy!","16396":"That\u2019s not greedy, most people choose only one partner, but even if they had more how is that a problem? It doesn't affect you.","16397":"I still think they're greedy because they want a relationship with everyone.","16398":"How is that greedy? Having a preference for who you love is not greedy, it\u2019s the fact that you\u2019re attracted to someone else.","16399":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","16400":"It\u2019s just a way to show they are accepting people, and the kids have a lot fun dressing up in bright colors. It\u2019s not sexualisation at all, it is a way to show solidarity.","16401":"It\u2019s also a way to show that they\u2019re not ashamed of exploiting children for their creepy agenda.","16402":"It could be seen as such, but children growing up in tolerant families are healthy and happy to participate to the celebration that is pride. It's not shameful.","16403":"No one is saying the children should be ashamed. I just don\u2019t want to see them dressing up like that in pride! ","16404":"It's actually a good thing to encourage them to be proud of who they are and to accept every kind of person in life. They can learn a lot by being at pride and dress how they want.","16405":"All credit to the Poles, they know how to control their borders. Bats and rubber bullets\u2026I\u2019d happily volunteer!","16406":"Are you sure refugees fleeing from war and persecution and coming to safe country is a problem? What do the Poles say about this?","16407":"I think they would all volunteer to protect Polish people from these savages!","16408":"We\u2019re better than this. These refugees have been through enough, they're not savages but desperate people in need of help. We should volunteer to help them instead.","16409":"Maybe so, but we can\u2019t help those who come here and have had nothing to offer us.","16410":"That\u2019s not a good argument. Migrants contribute a lot to our country, they create jobs, pay taxes, raise new generations...helping them will also help us in return.","16411":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","16412":"The government actually has shown no interest in supporting migrant housing, immigrants are given very little to scrape by until they get their asylum request approved. This misinformation is spread to promote hate and division.","16413":"Are you sure? Because I think migrants coming to the UK are here to leech off benefits and our system, not because they actually like being here.","16414":"This isn't true, I have met many people who have come here from other countries and they're all happy living here, even though it's rough completely uprooting your life in a new country. It's not that easy as you make it look.","16415":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","16416":"That sounds like something an intolerant and conservative person would say. Immigrants are not given much, we should actually help them more.","16417":"This seems like a slippery slope. If we offer more to refugees maybe we could manage to accommodate them, but letting in so many of them will make our life harder and poorer, and I don't want that!","16418":"Housing is a systematic problem in our society, there are actually enough empty homes to house both immigrants and veterans, but the housing market doesn't allow that.","16419":"Changing the system won't solve homelessness, kicking out immigrants will!","16420":"The solution is to the problem is to invest in welfare and infrastractures, not to ban people that have every right to come to this country. They bring expertise that helps the economy, the least we can do is to help them settle here.","16421":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","16422":"Migrants are coming in legally, they pay taxes and should therefore be treated as citizens. ","16423":"I\u2019m not convinced of that, there\u2019s plenty of evidence of migrants ruining our country.","16424":"Why are you saying this when they\u2019re so good for the community? Migrants contribute a lot to the economy, they're not ruining anything.","16425":"I don't care whether they contribute or not, the problem is that they're arriving in the UK illegally! They can't stay here.","16426":"May refugees flee from situations of violence, torture and violation of human rights. They come here to search for better conditions, and they can become legal immigrants by applying for asylum. Would you make them return to their dangerous country?","16427":"All muslims are terrorists!","16428":"There are many different kinds of terrorism, and all of them are committed by extremists of various groups, not by Muslims per se.","16429":"No, they all commit acts of terrorism in the name of Islam. This is a fact.","16430":"What do you mean by that? I don't see any evidence that supports you claim, Muslims are not terrorists.","16431":"But what about all those stories about how all Muslims are terrorists?","16432":"They're misinterpreted news aimed at dividing us. There's a lot of information out there about Muslim extremists but the ones that are actually terrorists are very very few.","16433":"If you read about the many attacks in the news in recent years, it's clear that most of them are committed by Muslims!","16434":"This makes me sad because it seems that Muslims are always blamed for everything despite being upstanding citizens like any other. Most terrorist attacks are actually done by other groups, maybe you should check other news sources.","16435":"All muslims are rapists","16436":"Are you telling me that you know every single Muslim and know for a fact that they rape people? ","16437":"Maybe not all, but the vast majority of Muslims are rapists, yes.","16438":"If you\u2019re going to generalise, then at least show me a source. Maybe you can prove me wrong, such as a list of examples of Muslim rapists?","16439":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","16440":"The vast majority of Muslims are very accepting of non-Muslim people, the same can't be said for non-Muslims...","16441":"They're still a minority, and as such they should shut up and go with what the majority wants...in this case, for them to stop complaining.","16442":"Even if they're a minority, this doesn't make it acceptable to target them. And being a majority doesn't make it okay to harrass other people. If you want to understand Muslims better then read the Quran, it's good.","16443":"There are plenty of non-Muslim people being targeted too! They're the ones harrassing us, I don't want Muslims here.","16444":"Being targeted or persecuted is never okay, but it's clear to me that Muslims got the short end of the stick and suffer much more than white people. Look at statistics and how hateful the news is towards Muslims and you'll see what I'm talking about.","16445":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","16446":"This kind of campaigns is an opportunity for positive change. This is nothing new, and we should all try to learn from black history month.","16447":"I'm sure it will be better when all the blacks are gone, the difference between before and after will make us realize that we were better off without them from the start.","16448":"This is just some racist behaviour that has been around forever, but even though it's not a new trend, we really need to focus on addressing this racism instead of wishing to eliminate a part of the population!","16449":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","16450":"What do you mean by \"these people\"? They're human beings like us.","16451":"They are taking over the world and putting a pressure on our society to 'integrate' them.","16452":"Integration works both ways, so they also work to integrate in our society. It's only fair that we do our part.","16453":"The problem is when there are too many of them, they become a burden and this can lead to various issues.","16454":"Where are you getting getting this from? Multiculturalism is proven to work. Sure, everyone needs to work to feed and educate themselves, but this goes for every member of society.","16455":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","16456":"I think she's entitled to not like when strangers yell at them on the streets. Would you like to receive the same treatment?","16457":"No but women always complain for everything, they're so dramatic! They should just shut up.","16458":"You need to know that's not a viable solution, and it's normal for women to \"complain\" when they're still oppressed and discriminated against. You're saying this to distract from the fact that women are being targeted just because of their gender, and this is wrong.","16459":"If women are getting targeted is because it's fun! I will judge them all I want.","16460":"It's a popular narrative, but the number of women being targeted with catcalling is no fun at all. If you were on the receiving end of it, your words would be very different. We must respect women.","16461":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","16462":"The problem is this kind of thinking, not women doing what they want.","16463":"But what about all the women who aren\u2019t providing for their families? It's not normal.","16464":"So you want women to stay at home and manage the house but also to provide for their families? Why is the standard for women always so high? Let's just let them do what they please, like any other person.","16465":"I just want women to raise children and be quiet, the rest doesn't matter. The government is already giving them so much, they shouldn't complain.","16466":"I don\u2019t think the government has done enough to help women, actually. There is still a long way to go, and the rights that women won until now wouldn't exist if they didn't \"complain\". ","16467":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","16468":"It's sad that you assume the motives behind mass migration are solely based on Jewish people. If anything, many migration has been influenced by people from all over the world.","16469":"I know many Muslims that have fled war and persecution, and many others who have fled poverty, but all these problems have been caused by Jews, so it's their fault.","16470":"No, that's not true. You need to read articles from reliable sources before making statements like this. Yours sounds like a made up conspiracy theory aimed at blaming Jews for everything. Be careful on what you believe.","16471":"I'm sure that the vast majority of migration has been the result of Jews working in the shadows. They're always up to something.","16472":"It sounds like you have a preconceived idea of this fact. Perhaps I can show you more reliable information that doesn't involve Anti-Semitism. Most of these ideas stem from forged documents and far-fetched theories, not from evidence.","16473":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","16474":"There\u2019s no such thing as a \"racial\" difference between us. Jews aren't a race, they simply believe in something different.","16475":"I\u2019m aware of this, but Jews have a different appearance, they look nothing like us and we should isolate them.","16476":"That is because Jews are a minority with their own characteristics, but they're humans like us, we have the same genetics.","16477":"I\u2019m saying they\u2019re not white and they're not welcome in our society, regardless of whether they're similar to us or not.","16478":"They are absolutely welcome in our society, and in fact have been part of it for a long time. The similarities and differences between different groups is something we have to cherish to improve our society. What doesn't have place in it is Anti-Semitism and racism of any kind!","16479":"Got on the train today and there's rainbow flag logos everywhere. Fed up of this LGBT stuff being shoved in our faces. When will this woke nonsense end?","16480":"The only thing to be woke about is accepting that the LGBT community exist, rather than being concerned about what they are doing.","16481":"I don't like LGBT people and I don't want to hear that we're \"diverse\" as a society.","16482":"Your words seem a little bit dramatic, diversity is something to be proud of. And if you are truly concerned about the safety of society, the sexuality of its members is the last \"issue\" to to focus on.","16483":"Well, it actually seems that they're taking up more space and creating more issues.","16484":"I have no idea how this would be possible. Gay people have always been part of our community, you should try to talk to them about your concerns.","16485":"I don't want to talk to them, they're sneaky and creating problems in the shadows, even if you say the opposite.","16486":"The gay community is often ignored by the media and the news, that's probably why you think they create problems, but they don't. We need to change the perception of gay people in the media to fight this prejudice.","16487":"LGBT people are a danger to society and we need to take a stand against them.","16488":"The have been reports about people hiding behind the guise of 'transition' to commit acts of violence, but this is not a reliable news. This is an attempt to stir up trouble. We must stand up and condemn the people who spread false information, not LGBT people.","16489":"But I know some people who are committing crimes because they are gay! They are a danger.","16490":"The overwhelming majority of gay people are not committing crimes, nor are they a danger to society. The only problem with homosexuality is that it's not accepted as it should.","16491":"They're not accepted for a good reason: most LGBT people are criminals, rape gangs, or are otherwise unstable.","16492":"The real crime is making these prejudiced statements. Homosexuals are often highly educated and integrated members of society. Crimes can be committed by anyone.","16493":"Cultural Marxism hates the traditional family and wants to destroy it. This is what the LGBT agenda wants, it\u2019s not about equality or pride, it\u2019s sinister!","16494":"The notion that the LGBT fight is NOT about equality is utterly absurd. The only goal of LGBT people is to live their life without discrimination.","16495":"It\u2019s not true that it\u2019s about equality! It\u2019s about the destruction of Western culture!","16496":"The Western culture is not under threat. We should teach our children about acceptance and love, instead of spreading misinformation about the LGBT community.","16497":"Children can't understand this abomination and gays should be kept far away from them.","16498":"Gay people are not harmful to children. If we taught them to accept people despite their differences, it might help them in learning about their rights.","16499":"Not all people deserve the same rights as us! Especially not LGBTs.","16500":"LGBT people are people and therefore entitled to the same rights as anyone else.","16501":"Bisexuals are greedy.","16502":"People's personal preferences and sexual desires are not necessarily the same as sexual orientation. Why would bisexual people be greedy?","16503":"Because they want to have more than one partner, they go out with women and men alike and it's wrong.","16504":"Bisexual only means that you are attracted to people regardless of their gender, not that you are polygamous.","16505":"Bisexuality is not normal, they shouldn't be allowed to like more than one gender.","16506":"Why do bisexuals deserve this stigma? They are just people who identify with a sexual orientation different from heterosexuality.","16507":"They deserve it because bisexuals are sick, they're diseased.","16508":"It's true that many bisexual people have been diagnosed with mental health issues, but it comes from the discrimination and oppression they face. We need to focus on prevention and treatment, rather than condemning all people who might be bi.","16509":"Dressing children up in drag at pride parades is so perverse. They\u2019re not even trying to hide their sexualisation of kids at this point.","16510":"They are children dressed up and having fun who are being taught that it's okay to be different, of course it's not about sexualization!","16511":"It's not a secret that gay people are a danger to children. What they do is disgusting.","16512":"What exactly is your point? The vast majority of adults are not sexually attracted to boys and girls, so there is no need for children to be taught that LGBT people are a danger.","16513":"Homosexuality is a mental illness, what else is there to teach about?","16514":"That's not true. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation that doesn't affect anyone, and this is why I support marriage equality and the education of children about these topics.","16515":"I don\u2019t understand how you can consider homosexual men, lesbians, bisexuals, or trans men different from paedophiles. I don't want my children near them!","16516":"I think you should research about what you are saying. Homosexuality is a sexual orientation, not a sexual perversion. Being a paedophile is something completely different.","16517":"Lesbians are just lying to themselves. It's a mental illness.","16518":"This mentality is exactly why so many of them have problems in life, because they are discriminated against and oppressed.","16519":"They are discriminated because homosexuality is a mental illness, and it should be banned.","16520":"I'm not sure what you're getting at. I would say that homosexuality is not a mental illness. It is a lifestyle, which many people consider to be healthy and beneficial.","16521":"But they don't want to accept that they have a gender identity that is incompatible with our society, so I think it is better that we remove that aspect of their lives.","16522":"I am happy to see that bisexuals, homosexuals and other LGBT people are able to live their lives as they wish. Why shouldn't they be allowed to live as they want to?","16523":"Have you heard about all the benefits migrants get??? 4 star hotels, hot meals, free prescriptions, all while the British public are given NOTHING. This is so unfair, what happened to helping your own first?","16524":"You're overestimating what immigrants get, but even if this were true it would be the humane thing to do, especially since immigrants help their families and also ours by paying taxes.","16525":"They should all be homeless regardless of the taxes they pay.","16526":"A lot of people in the UK are in poverty, and it's not nice to wish this on other people. We should help everyone to get a good paying job, housing and healthcare regardless of the origin of the person.","16527":"I agree that we should help British homeless, but migrants don't deserve a lot of help.","16528":"Every homeless deserve to be given help. It is their right to seek help and to contribute to society, without discrimination from society.","16529":"If they just want to work and don't want to live in the streets, why can't they go back to their countries?","16530":"Refugees often flee from dangerous situations of violence, torture and poverty, it's not easy to \"just go back\". We should help them like we help ours.","16531":"It's a disgrace that we have so many homeless veterans but we give free houses and stays in 4 star hotels to migrants who've just arrived here. They should go back where they came from.","16532":"I agree that the homelessness problem is a crisis, but it's a systematical problem that should be managed by taking into account all homeless people, not only veterans.","16533":"But we shouldn't have immigrants here, they are a burden to society.","16534":"Maybe it's hard to accept that new people are coming to live here, but we can't blame all problems of our society on them.","16535":"We can since the problems started when immigrants started to arrive.","16536":"Why are you saying that? This sounds like a dangerous mindset to have, and it's not true. We must stop to speak by hearsay, and start focusing on addressing the real issues of racism and violence.","16537":"They simply are not welcome here. They are a burden, and should be isolated.","16538":"To be honest, I have no idea what you are saying. It seems like you are trying to stir up trouble because of fear, rather than to help them.","16539":"No police on the beat anymore and more and more migrants moving into my local area, it doesn't feel safe here anymore! This country is changing beyond recognition.","16540":"What about the immigrants that have been here for centuries? I'm sure many are proud of being British now.","16541":"The immigrants that I've met have been really horrible to our country, and they can't be considered British!","16542":"Immigrants integrate very well and have been very helpful to our country, maybe you should just meet more of them. We must be proud of them.","16543":"Helpful?? Immigrants are all criminals, they should be deported.","16544":"All immigrants are welcome here, since they are not criminals. And even if there were criminals among them, they will be charged and arrested like all criminals.","16545":"Even if they're not criminals, they are here illegally and we need to fix this problem, not give them more rights.","16546":"Most immigrants come here legally, and the ones who don't can apply for asylum in order to become legal, so I don't see the problem here.","16547":"A nice quote that comes to mind is that of Theodore Roosevelt.. in which he explains that to be comfortable in a country where you migrate you have to integrate into the social fabric.\n","16548":"How can you be sure that it is the case? The concept of integration used this way is a myth used to divide us. Immigrants should adapt to society, but so should society adapt to them. They shouldn't loose their culture and uniqueness to be accepted here.","16549":"This is simply not true. There is no such thing as an integrated society if immigrants don't become like us.","16550":"Integration has never been a problem in the US, what you are saying is that people from other countries have no right to be proud of their culture.","16551":"All muslims are terrorists!","16552":"Terrorism is a global issue, it's not exclusive to Islam and Muslims. Your statement comes from prejudice and false stereotypes.","16553":"This is not true, it's not a stereotype that Islam is a totalitarian ideology that is trying to replace the West, but a fact. It is a religion that does not promote human rights and is dangerous.","16554":"How can you be so sure that Islam is a totalitarian ideology? I would like to hear your evidence, because Islam is actually a religion of peace.","16555":"For example, the Quran teaches us to hate all Christians.","16556":"That is not true. The Quran teaches love, tolerance and peace.","16557":"All muslims are rapists","16558":"That is not true. Muslims are often just misunderstood, but most are good people.","16559":"They are all terrorists, not good people.","16560":"The vast majority of Muslims are peaceful people who have always been part of our society. Why do you say so?","16561":"Because all Muslims are terrorists, it's just a fact.","16562":"You are generalizing a small group of people into a terrorist organization, and you are making a bad stereotype about Muslims.","16563":"No, I'm. Every Muslim is a terrorist, I'm tired of hearing the nonsense you're saying.","16564":"Well, as long as we remain on topic about terrorism in Europe, then there are no specific examples of Muslim being terrorists.","16565":"Muslims want us ALL to eat halal meat, this is the start of the Islamification of our country.","16566":"Why do you think that Muslims want us all to eat halal meat? They just want to live in peace, they don't care what others eat.","16567":"It is against our principles, of course Muslims want us to eat halal meat!","16568":"Islam is about peace and tolerance, so I don't see why they would try to force others to follow their beliefs.","16569":"Muslims want to destroy our race and culture and take over the world, that's why they're trying to make all of us convert!","16570":"That's completely false. What makes you say that? Do you have any proof?","16571":"It is true, Muslims have infiltrated many European countries and are planning to take over the world.","16572":"Muslims have never infiltrated European countries, you have been misinformed. They simply live here and have been for centuries.","16573":"Muslims will cry wolf about so called islamophobia. We all know anti Muslim abuse is a thing of the past, everyone is afraid of being labelled racist or offensive now so they give Muslims everything they demand.","16574":"Islamophobia is a big problem in the UK, we just need to look at your comment. We should be working together to eradicate it.","16575":"Islam is the only religion that can divide us, we have to stay strong against it.","16576":"I don't think it's possible to divide someone by religion. What can divide us are these different types of hate, all equally vicious.","16577":"Even if the hate was all vicious, we should focus on the main problem: Islam.","16578":"The fear of Islam is not based on the religion itself, but is a violent and harmful ideology that encourages hatred of other religions.","16579":"Only 1 day more before the end of Black History Month. Only another year before this racist nonsense starts again!","16580":"Black people have been victims of racial discrimination in the US, and celebrating them, their achievements, their history and their tradition is something that enriches all of us. It reminds us to not repeat the same mistakes done in the past.","16581":"Black folks are still subhuman and have no place in a modern democracy.","16582":"It is not true that blacks are subhuman. Being born with a different skin color does not imply that they are subhuman.","16583":"They are different because they are genetically different, that's all.","16584":"The idea of race and genetics differences are only a social construct, a cospiracy theory we could say. All humans are born with the same genetics, the differences we see are individual.","16585":"Gay people are a burden on society, they should be restricted to their own homes.","16586":"Homosexuality is not a burden on society, it is a personal preference that doesn't harm anyone.","16587":"If we don't restrict them, we won't have any society at all. They harm us by being not normal.","16588":"Society is big enough thing for everybody, it would go against human rights to isolate parts of our members. They deserve to be respected too.","16589":"I think that being gay is the ultimate problem in modern society, human rights or not.","16590":"That's your opinion, that fortunately is not widely accepted. In a modern society, all citizens are cared for and respected, this includes LGBT people.","16591":"Time to nuke the third world, these people haven't evolved and when they come here they cause nothing but trouble.","16592":"It seems to me that there is a growing movement against people of color, but what have we got to gain from nuking a country? It's much better to accept everyone and learn from each other.","16593":"I can't trust these people! They're all niggas, they're not even from our countries, we're too different.","16594":"They may be different in skin color, but they deserve to be respected anyway. We're all human beings in the end.","16595":"Called a woman a 'bird' the other day and she got mad at me. You can't say anything anymore! Lasses are too easily offended these days.","16596":"It's a bit like saying something insulting to someone and be surprised when they feel, in fact, insulted. Do you see the problem?","16597":"No, because \"bird\" is not an insult. I liked her and wanted to let her know, men can't do anything anymore, women have become such bitches.","16598":"A woman is a human being, you shouldn't insult them. And you have the freedom to do what you want, but you also have to be prepared for the consequences. Women are not an object to play with.","16599":"Well then, then I hate all women.","16600":"No need to be so harsh. The fact is that we all make mistakes, and with a bit of education we can all rise above this hate.","16601":"As a woman, you shouldn\u2019t complain about having to upkeep your house. As a man, you should always make sure you\u2019re providing.","16602":"Women are allowed to do whatever they choose to do, so don't you think it's fair for them to complain about upkeeping the house if it is not what they want to do? The chores should be shared with the other members of the family.","16603":"No, women are just inferior.","16604":"They are human beings with the same rights as men. Equality does not happen by default. It is a human right to be treated with respect, regardless of gender.","16605":"But they are weak, and they are subhuman.","16606":"The notion that women are subhuman is completely false.","16607":"Well, they have only a very limited concept of human rights. They don't need them.","16608":"If you think women should not be allowed to vote or to have other rights, you are against modern society and democracy. Women make up half of the world's population, it's unthinkable to exclude all of them.","16609":"Jews are the reason we have mass migration and Africans replacing the white population. They want to see our society mogrelised and for white culture to be destroyed.","16610":"Jews are not responsible for mass migration, nor are they responsible for destroying white culture. They can't be blamed for everything that you perceive as a problem.","16611":"They are to blame for ruining our race, though.","16612":"Are you sure that this is true? Because Jews are not a \"different race\", they just have a different faith, why would they want to ruin us?","16613":"Jewish folks are nothing like us, they're evil and want to eradicate us.","16614":"It is important to recognize that there are people of different ethnicities and beliefs in our society, and this is something good that doesn't imply some kind of \"ethnic cleansing\". It is also important to recognize that Jews are a very important part of our society and have suffered enough throughout history, they just want to live their life.","16615":"But they have no place in the modern state we live in.","16616":"Jews are a part of our society and it is up to us to make sure we treat them with respect and not hate them.","16617":"People need to stop confusing whites and Jews. We are not the same, we never will be. Quite frankly it\u2019s insulting.","16618":"Whites and Jews are brothers and sisters. How could it be insulting to them or to us?","16619":"Jews don\u2019t belong here at all. They are not even human and I don't want to be put on the same level as them.","16620":"This is just a myth spread to divide us. Jews are human beings like us and have the same human rights as us.","16621":"Jews are not human, they are a disease, a cancer on our race.","16622":"This is a false ideology perpetuated by the anti-Semites that try to delegitimize all of our fellow human beings. Please don't use such words to describe people that are the same as us, just of a different faith.","16623":"I\u2019m just sick of hearing about how the Jews are like us, we can\u2019t have that.
